0,TheArmbandFPL,Z5gRIZ2JmT8,FPL GW5 PREVIEW | BAD TO WORSE | FPL ARMBAND,2024-09-19T04:41:29Z,sh hello everyone and welcome to the FPL armband I'm Chris kieran's here too hello good right how are you good how it doing not too bad today obviously going to preview game week 5 it's a bit of shorter show than than usual but we're going to do our best to fill him had a busy week this week so um thanks for tuning in so we'll talk about the awful n of game week four and then uh yeah have a little pivot and talk about game week five it was so bad wasn't it this past game I mean I didn't do as bad as other non hard Harland lless teams but um you know I've had a um yeah all red arrows so far this season so that's that's been oh my word is it yeah I've not had a single green yet yeah so cool I had yeah I think I had two game week two and three were green and then I just sunk back down to like 3.2 million now it's it's Savage I don't even know how you're below me how how's that happened I'm only two million Rank and I've not owned Ireland I know I know I I had a nightmare this weekend with the um with the transfers let's let's get on to of course you did to that um I'll just go through mine quickly quickly first so I was so sure that I Trent was going to come in for CBA at the start of the game we I was thinking that's a you know there's a guarantee like uptick on that because you know cling sheet looked pretty nailed on there was loads of attacking potential there that didn't I didn't think that was going to backfire so obviously that backfired and then I was contemplating for age to do sackur and Bruno out and on Saturday morning I did it for Salah and minty and oh my gosh Point swing was horrendous um I think I worked out if i' you know just sat on my team and not done any moves CBA sacka and Bruno would have got like 17 points and I took a hit to do it so I gained I gained one point so I was like 18 points down it was just it was just Savage but a lot of people wouldn't say position because they got rid of sacka but it's just yeah yeah not it was a bad outcome I mean how do you feel about it going into the next few weeks yeah happy well I I sort of ear marked um game week six pretty sure I'm still going to Wild Card them because there's so many like little problems in my team well to Kona is obviously a problem moon is is is a problem I don't like the balance of having s and harand still Henderson's been pretty crap I might get an Arsenal defender back again so yeah there's a and brenford so there's a few things I'd definitely like to change for game week six but you know the team looks okay for this game week as if esa's fit but yeah we'll talk more about that in a minute let's at your team yeah you got um yeah just bailed out by harand didn't you did you even start Smith Murray this week yeah I did yeah I started Smith yeah Smith ran Harlem were the only ones that actually did return for me this game week so yeah it was poor and then to B off three people did return was not good right I put I put your you know your Merry soldiers up there as well yeah so um 45 um obviously one point below you um so I did um Hall to dunk and see all starting was kind of annoying but they they conceded didn't they I can't remember what happened in that game they did they two1 okay yeah so yeah dunk came in six points it was a free transfer so no no points loss for hits or anything um so that was nice um yeah and then obviously Watkins coming in clutch with 13 points which is great um you know he is fairly low owned by the sort of Twitter bubble and yeah yeah people seem to just be put off by his minutes which obviously yeah I kind of get um and then yeah Smith row coming off the bench for um J Pedro I didn't really see that bunching benching coming like no nobody knew about this random knock at all like so um you know he just came back from his thing and from his Internationals just he played like 45 minutes and yeah not in the squad at all just so um I think someone's on twit said or on X or whatever um that like they had the chance all these all these journalists were asking all these questions and nobody even asked about J Pedro's Fitness at all no nobody even mentioned it so obviously naturally nothing was said about it so yeah is what it is um and they haven't said whether he's I don't think they've given any specific update to if he's going to be back or not I heard it was something minor just just to knock and he should be fine for the next one but um I guess we'll see um yeah so I am I benched cver in in favor of porro um sort of attacking upside I thought and home fixture didn't think there'd be a clean sheet for for Arsenal in there so I got I got bit in there a little bit but um yeah that kind of sucks but yeah Saka getting return was decent yeah coming in um Isa ISAC off at halim annoying um hopefully he's fine this week the sort of eye eye injury is what it says on yeah so hope he's okay jotter again just a little bit disappointing um yeah he played 64 is minutes in the Champions League so hopefully that means he'll start again this weekend but he didn't look great in the Champions League league as far as I've heard um so yeah bourou for home is obviously a great fixture for him but he needs to be scoring um in the first 60 otherwise he's probably getting off with no points again so um yeah Rogers as well like even last night in the Champions League for Villa like he started and at first he started he those 3-0 3-0 and he again didn't get any returns like all of the attacking mid all of the midfielders and Watkins all got a return like a goal or assist and he once again got nothing and he's just flirting with any kind of points isn't he he just yeah he looks good he looks good though I watched like the highlights of that game and he he's always in dangerous positions and he obv did one preseason I think it's just unlucky that he hasn't returned yet to be honest I have just s such a quandry of like who to start out him as Smith row this weekend as well like I'm really not sure that he could go either way hopefully well maybe Isaac be injured and make a decision a bit easier for you but yeah that's um it's it's rough um I'll just bring up the some of the numbers from the the weekend I think it was a bit of like a unusual one I just sort it by XG mateta was um an interesting like one this weekend obviously for me and other a owners it was irritating to see him take a penalty with something which I was sort of like locked into thinking oh that's there's no question E's on on pens and another set pieces for Palace so to see that like in the 90 whatever minute that he stepped up and took and then afterwards glasner said they're going to be sharing penalties and it's up to them toci side on the pitch I feel like mata's such a big presence he's just going to take them anyway yeah who who was fou do you know um I think think it was it might have been S no I think it was s off top of my head yeah I think he got the assist for the penalty so yeah it wasn't even like yeah he he he won it he played well and he I think it's taken like that for me to think he could be a a better option than e for like the well when palace's fixure is a bit better Watkins was was right at the top for XG as well at the weekend four big chances was the most of anyone I'm a bit jealous of not having him and you having him this weekend so but I kind of feel like if it isak's out I do have the the money there to go isach to to Watkins so you're not really worried about his his minutes hey Watkins yeah I think got that ankle knock but emry said it looked like it was going to be okay yeah um yeah the the the John Duran thing is there like he is like well but he did play 83 minutes in the the Premier League this weekend so you know his minutes in the Premier League are at least sort of trending upwards he looks like a beast doesn't he that goal he scored like at the weekend that was incredible yeah that was amazing and that that goal he scored last last night that got ruled out was a cracking finish as well yeah so maybe they'll get them starting together at some point but I just don't see I don't ever see Watkins getting dropped for him like that just doesn't seem to be a thing like he's he's come in and scored two goals like when he's obviously starting and he's just just providing more Assurance to Emory that he's he's the nailed on starter you know so um if they can find a way to play them both then great but is Duran gonna be as good from the start in games I would say probably not but yeah so um yeah I think I'm fine with his minutes as long as that angle thing in the Champions League was was not an issue like Wolves at home absolutely great picture isn't it so really good um and yeah I think at the moment I'll be playing Rogers ahead of Smith R because Smith's got Newcastle at home which doesn't sound too bad either but Rogers I surely surely this week he's gonna get something like um yeah he's gonna be a bit ofit troll isn't he but um yeah liking Walkins at the moment and I think he's um obviously a good transfering for most people I think yeah definitely and looking at some of the other numbers I was thinking about like as soon as munes was dropped to the bench and then last night it looks like he's definitely not first choice now cuz he played like in the a B team and I think he picked up a knock at the end so he's just been like tragically woeful for for me and you you were right that you said he just wasn't up to it and it was his like purple patch and yeah it was in the yeah I'm so happy I avoided him because I was I was so close to doing it and I just went for that J Pedra instead and just yeah obviously J predra didn't play this week but he's been way up compared to mun I don't think munas has got any returns is he not even no he's got a single return in like the you know he should on paper have had like two of the easiest fixtures in um yeah uh ipswitch and and Leicester back to back and yeah he's just he's just not done it so um yeah I was a bit disappointed about that but Replacements I was thinking of like a who I would get in at that price bracket to replacing do you think um I mean if Pedro isn't coming back for the weekend do you think uh welbeck's a good a good shout this week his fixtures like longterm aren't that great but I'm just trying to think if people are on Wild Card 6 who's there who's like a plum forward to to get in this yeah yeah he could be we did just see Liverpool blank against not and Forest so the forest victure is probably not as as juicy as we maybe think it was um yeah like that's the Liverpool game has probably made me rethink that um that this is so good to be honest or like well is obviously they're at home and Brighton is scoring plenty of goals so maybe it's not as bad um as I'm maybe making out but um yeah I'm definitely going to be starting Pedro I'm hoping he's fit um but Welbeck I'm not sure M should do fine um his his numbers from that like game were so awful I just didn't give any confidence maybe that that you know Brighton were pretty stifled like he had an XG of 0.0 and an XA of 0.2 and he only got like 70 minutes I mean I was expecting 70 minutes but yeah it wasn't I was expecting um you know a little higher on both of those numbers yeah I think if you haven't gone well back already I think you just don't bother now to be honest no I no I I think um they're they're fixtures turn quite quickly after this I just had had a quick look so after Forest Chelsea Spurs Newcastle and then wolves Liverpool and City so yeah the next run also you I personally don't mind Chelsea and Spurs like they're they're fine because they're both not great defensively um and then Newcastle yeah is be tough I think but then Wolves at home you know but I think Brighton are probably going to score against most teams and Pedro and M you assume and well probably will be involved so I don't know um yeah is this fixture is a little bit like just worrying because of what Liverpool did against them and Al also while we're still on strik as whist was someone who I was looking at for for game week six obviously got this ankle knock and he'd been having like a great start as he 28 points in the first four game weeks and obviously scored against City and highest XG of any like forward under like that 6.5 price bracket to have him not in the game is going to create a lot of yeah opportunity I was quite interested in vard as a pick this game week thinking I I know one we punts aren't really a thing before wild card but I just didn't like the idea of Mo is potentially having a a priz drop or just you know getting some skin in a different game but the fact that vard's only had like three shots in the Box this season and he scored them all just makes me think like how sustainable is that even against a a very bad Everton side so yeah I was interested in vardy for a matter of about a minute I mean vard's goal scoring record in the premier league is is top top tier to be honest like whenever he has actually played like he's just gets tons of goals like 2122 15 goals three assists 20 20 21 got 15 goals 14 assists like 19 20 got 23 goals seven like before that 18 goals 20 goals before that 13 goals the 24 goals like yeah every season he's actually in the Prem like he scores so I mean obviously he's he's old now but like forms so far says he's just like if he gets the chances he'll probably finish them yeah I didn't expect him to come back and be like I mean I know it's only four games humle size I didn't come back expect him to come back into the league and be as yeah I don't know as reliable as he has been I mean two 90 minutes in the last two and I expect that he'll start to play more 90s I think he played less at the start of the season because he didn't get much preseason but yeah he's he surprised me in the fact that he's looking so N I think was it daa Pon daer is meant to be like his injured long-term replacement but yeah he's injured and he's obviously in place over Edward so yeah but what's what's Lester's like XG as a team it's probably pretty low right uh let's have a quick look yeah it's like second bottom behind I switch or ahead of it switch so 3.3 is obviously a big big jump compared to I 1.5 but um yeah so it's like his chances are going to be minimal but if he's going to finish everyone he gets then who get his first place yeah absolutely I mean just looking at the XGC of like expected goals con of um this game week and Everton up at 8.3 and they've not really played any big hitters either apart from Spurs I suppose arguably but this season they played uh they played Villa um Bournemouth and Bri I suppose Brighton as well so yeah but there some of the results just what's what's the odds of like them going two n up again and then losing 32 I don't imagine imagine if you put a bet on that like three weeks yeah no they've just not not not done well so far this season and you know Leicester I wonder it's a big weekend actually for like games at both ends of the table because you've got the um this Lester and Everton game and you've got ipswitch and Southampton playing each other based on like the start of the Season those four basically right near the bottom for expected goals conceded down just number of points on the board so yeah it could be a weekend to work out who is essentially going to be Rel relegation candidates this season or this season yeah and obviously talking of like mun's replacement DCL was obviously one people started to look at as well but yeah he's apparently ill so um won't I think he's been almost pretty much nailed out ruled out sorry for this weekend which seems kind of early for someone who's just ill um on a Wednesday or Tuesday to be like he's ruled out of the weekend because he's just ill that seems strange to me but um yeah like yeah his form's been okay like two blanks in the first two but then 12 points and six points and the two after that so he started to pick up some momentum and he's and he's been playing good minutes as well which is is obviously rare for him so he looks a little bit injuryf free at least um so um yeah a shame um I guess look at the presses on on Friday or or Thursday whenever it is for them um and hopefully he might get a pass of just being fit and and people can get onto him so but I think he probably is a good options because those those Runner fixtures are are really really good aren't they it's funny because if you if you someone that plays the fixtures which I kind of am a little bit to try and like Get on Board of the form like someone like mcneel he just like no way an FPL like exciting pick but he he has done well for that 5.5 million bracket like he's he's sort of on par with Smith row if you were looking for a side sideways move and you know calv Leen obviously you just mentioned is or was performing at a similar level for slightly more expensive obviously in a forward slot but yeah it's definitely not doesn't not exciting is he no I I don't think I'd ever pick McNeil like ever just just he's going to start blanking like he will score in some games but he's just he's just not an FPL pick for me no no um all right is there any anyone else you want to mention or should we just have a look at our our teams for the weekend and some of our considerations what we might do yeah let's move on yeah let's go it's a bit of a shorter show tonight so let's let's start with with your team game five boys yeah yeah so at the moment um I do have sber on the bench um obviously I was I was hurt by benching him last week they got three clean sheets out of four so far um but it is Man City away so I guess that makes sense but maybe I'll be bitten again um on that but probably not I I hope at Le I hope at least they can stop Harland scoring more than one that would be great um so yeah but s on the bench um yeah M wandry as I said earlier like Smith Row versus Rogers to start um is really the only decision I have other than SL but S I think is just nail to the bench um so yeah who who do you think you would go for at the moment I'm starting Rogers um because I think probably on paper that the Smith R's fixture is harder yeah um but Smith row showing way more maybe not such like form I guess he is in form of like points but like Rogers looks good on the ey test so you know yeah I think you're probably right to be honest to start start Rogers wolves have been worse than Newcastle defensively um so yeah I probably think I I like that that play to be honest yeah I'd probably stick with it even though I think Smith Smith row has been good so far this season it's difficult because you're you know you're picking you don't want to pick historical just because he's got points doesn't necessarily mean he's going to get some but then you're trying to base it on the fixture so yeah I probably just about like a agree with you on on that one to be honest yeah um Sal Captain probably the standout captain of the week um bour for home great fixture bourman obviously been quite good but they they do concede goals at least so yeah Salah um obviously blanks last week it's I just kind of could see him being the first one to blank out of him in Holland so um unfortunate obviously but um yeah blanks last night in the Champions League so hopefully he's thirsty for more more points this weekend that'd be good um yeah um sacka you still going to play him obviously I think he could probably get something against city they're still liable to to concede a couple um yeah J Pedro I'm gonna start as well he should be fine like obviously got decent enough back up on the bench isach unless I hear anything I think he should be fine too um and it's a good fixture um yeah hoping for points from Trent porro has a decent up fixture but I think brenford will probably score yeah and then yeah dunk got home to Forest I think it's pretty good Forest don't look that good at pack in and and Brighton have looked better defensively so um yeah I think on paper my team looks quite good um hopefully this could be one week one week where I don't have to worry about Holland yeah no I think you're right is definitely one week you don't have to worry about Holland I think with the double Villa double Liverpool and Pedro I think you're pretty Prime there if they have big games I don't really see there's going to be like loads of rotation even though it's like the first Champions League week of the season but it maybe a little bit it was interesting that slot said last night that um he was going to start gakpo in the game at the weekend but he came back a bit fresher so that's kind of hints towards that he's he will make um fresh let's say freshness based decisions in his front fre which you know is kind of fair enough and you'd expect that so yeah J J and J gapco coming off um early at the weekend maybe suggests that jotter and GAP Cod could start but but then Diaz has been his starter in the Premier League so I think it probably will be still yeah so are you still thinking about wild carding soon or you quite happy because you not no plans to get harand still or have changed since last week no it's still not changed but I'm thinking probably like a seven Wild Cup maybe eight um just because I want to keep um Liverpool for those two six and seven with those walls away Crystal Palace away I might move j off at that time if he starts like getting benched but um yeah I want Salah for so yeah I'm thinking seven or eight okay what and then at that point you got need strong to still keep Salah then and not have or just a bit too far ah had to think about yeah not sure to be I might pivot at that point because yeah what's Holland's fixtures like after eight I haven't even looked they're nice they are um yeah well actually after eight let me just double check I know seven he's got Fulham I think eight he's got Southampton at home which is you you know a game you'd probably want him for so yeah oh no sorry Southampton homes in n in nine so it's Wolves Away in eight Southampton then bouth Brighton Spurs then it's yeah is pretty good isn't it yeah yeah he's just got this this tricky game next against Arsenal which I think might be another nil nil or or one no you're right I don't think he's going to do big hauling this game yeah Fair um shame that I'm going to have to buy him for 15.3 if I if I go there um I mean I like the like yeah that three odd million that I'm going to have to like downgrade someone to would be probably getting rid of Trent in my team or something like that you know which doesn't feel great um yeah no I like it okay um any more to to say on that one no just uh Watkins double race again would be nice oh yeah oh I'd get the vice captaincy I mean you probably haven't said that yet Vice captaincy on probably put on yeah I think he him and Rogers look look good for this week yeah um so here I look at this and just think it looks like a mess but maybe it isn't too bad so Henderson in go like you I've got Trent porro and and coner this week so typical as well like I've played coner twice this season against Leicester and against Everton and they've conceded and then they kept a clean sheet in the Champions League last night I was like come on man so frustrating so um yeah got that backline the Midfield is a bit of a mix at the minute so you can tell it's a Salah and harand team recently I've got Salah Smith R minty and a obviously e got another goal and assist last night in the League Cup game so his numbers in non Premier League competitions this season have been so good so maybe finally again I mean United against Southampton I know you didn't watch much of that one but I watched the first half and you know the game flipped when Anana saved the penalty but they were so open against um yeah I can see Palace winning to be honest yeah I could see them winning as well like I think there's a bit of a but even though as a United fan there was like obviously the huge result last night and they won at the weekend but I don't really think from watching that Southampton game anything's really changed and I feel like if Palace are on it they yeah could easily win that game and that I think is probably a better game for EZ to return a bit like that Chelsea game where he's got slightly more space so yeah um happy about that Min obviously I don't really know what to expect there munes has lost his place I feel like the team is is looking like it's ready for a wild card it's like limping towards one could maybe this week but and leave some Arsenal players on the bench but that would just be such a bad decision after taking a minus four last week just to get Salah specifically for this so I don't really think I can do that um and then obviously talking about isach I agree I think he's probably going to be all right if he's not I'm going to get Watkins if munice is out I've got enough money to do Winks to Rogers and play Rogers cuz I think that fixture looks good um or I can get any full under like 6 million and I'd maybe get jedro if he looks like he's going to be fit so yeah there's a couple of different options to get on one of those fixures I don't necessarily like the double up against Forest you're right because they were good defensively last week so maybe more likely I get Rogers so I've got an attacking output in that game so yeah well I'll see about that what do you think or lack of attacking output in that game yeah true yeah ey test output yeah I I don't know what do you think you you do with mois like definitely going to get rid of him I'm just trying to think who else is like that's why I came across like vardy and even DCL cuz I thought that game was going to be quite open but what's that um Evan Nelson's fixtures for bourma I think they're quite tough he's playing way against we got remember I'm probably going to Wild Card in game week six so they it's only just probably going to be yeah yeah I mean one week then yeah yeah he's only had one like three shots all season I don't know about that but yeah I it maybe I think yeah it's probably him or J Pedro I guess yeah yeah no but I'm I'm pretty sure munis isn't going to start and I don't fancy Robinson keeping a clean sheet against Newcastle and it seems counterproductive playing isack as well so it's either yeah it's either Winks to Rogers and plays three who's brenford got this week Tottenham away okay would you consider that Sharda guy because obviously whis is out I don't know if he's a forward in the game not actually sure um maybe I'm just no he's down as a midfielder 5.4 it's a shame yeah no probably not to be honest but he's someone I oh no I can't get I can basically get to Rogers from Winks I think I've got point six and Jackson could you get there Jackson what Chelsea Jackson yeah no I think he's 75 oh is he that expensive yeah I think he is yeah 76 actually W okay yeah so um yeah options are pretty limited but yeah I don't know Chris Wood obviously he's got Liverpool yeah oh he's got ntia Nika maybe that's double Palace attack and they've not been like yeah so yeah I know it just it's choosing from like a a shower of [ __ ] basically so it's either P vardy who hasn't got like great underlying data against a bad everon and rely on him getting one shot and scoring and getting nine points or get Rogers be frustrated for an hour and get two or three points yeah s in the chat but back Calio punt um I'm not sure he's a forward either is he I don't think he is he scored I know he did well in the I think he did well in the League Cup last night I think he got a gold and two assist two assists yeah yeah let me double check caral now he's a mid he's 4.8 and he's he will be a great option once he starts to actually play in the Prem yeah yeah he is a good player I do quite like that sh but I um I think I'll definitely know more for I kind of want another week even though I'm expecting like another red arrow I kind of think another week of just getting a few more just know a few more minutes ideas maybe some penalty takers I don't know we'll see yeah Winks to Galo if he's looks like he's goingon to start and just drop mun to the bench could be okay yeah I think it probably go that way so yeah probably oh and obviously Captain C this week is probably quite easy I got Sal to Captain him this this week while Holland has this difficult awaken I think that's pretty straightforward isn't it this week yeah I think it's going to be one of those weeks where like the the template bounces back about a little bit like most sort of good players I think could get some returns last week was a bit of a drab one but this week I feel like he's just going to come back and Trent's gonna get his first attack of return and yeah everyone will be happy this week yeah no I kind of feel like that happen sometimes after the international break like there's some funny results they've been away so long it's just oh just so gut like I can't believe already in game we four eight 18 points down off a a hit gone just and when the hit includes Trent and Salah as well I was just thinking it's never going to not come in yeah um hopefully that the the guys on a YouTube channel can get into the one million ranks at least sometimes too nice Harry in the chat said not not just us he's got 40 points and down 3.7 million as well so he's going to keep plugging away but yeah I feel feel like it's yeah it's been a tough start and then I was having a look at like some of the I think FPL fol will maybe put on Twitter like one of the account one of the people that's like 11th in the world made no transfers and the team's like fairly template and you just think oh God anyway must have harand does he have both I think he has just Harland he has just harand he's probably got Diaz in there or something he did have Diaz and then he like he Diaz was the only other and Co will maybe were the only other non like template picks um but yeah it made me think blind that's quite like a template team and doing so well with no transfers I think he's 11th in the world yeah man new pork jobs he's got a big at the back Gabrielle Trent porro and Rea okay yeah a lot lot of people have done well with Raya haven't they people wild card in game four or three all picked Rea they've been doing well on him his ownership is so high for a goalkeeper yeah this season cool yeah like Sanchez at Chelsea could start to be an okay obviously yeah West Ham away Brighton at home Forest at home next three Liverpool after that but then and new and United and Arsenal after that so that four doesn't look great but maybe saves and stuff like that so yeah yeah absolutely all right any more to to add tonight I don't think so um yeah just Salah returns that would be great yeah exactly I want big Salah returns and smallish how Returns what do you think the score in that game is going to be which one the Arsenal City yeah Aral City game yeah uh I think both teams score so like a 2-1 City maybe yeah okay yeah bit more probably har bracing it be honest he was really poor against um Arsenal last season at the etad it wasn't nil nil wasn't it I would think surely like ca and Gabrielle Ted team can can best best in yeah yeah I hope it's not boring though I feel like last season's game at yes it was boring but I think it's incentive for City to go for it because just because Arsenal already points that's and they play Thursday doesn't that suck they play Thursday evening away and City play tonight at home in the Champions League feel like that's an unfair Advantage as well indeed anyway all right cool yeah we'll be back next week thanks everyone for joining us this short show we'll back next week with a slightly longer one yeah thanks so,6416,sh hello everyone and welcome to the fpl armband im chris kierans here too hello good right how are you good how it doing not too bad today going to preview game week 5 its a bit of shorter show than usual but were going to do our best to fill him had a busy week this week so thanks for tuning in so well talk about the awful n of game week four and then have a little pivot and talk about game week five it was so bad wasnt it this past game i didnt do as bad as other non hard harland lless teams but ive had a all red arrows so far this season so thats thats been my word is it ive not had a single green yet so cool i had i think i had two game week two and three were green and then i just sunk back down to like 32m now its its savage i dont even know how youre below me hows that happened im only two million rank and ive not owned ireland i know i know i had a nightmare this weekend with the with the transfers lets lets get on to of course you did to that ill just go through mine quickly first so i was so sure that i trent was going to come in for cba at the start of the game we i was thinking thats a theres a guarantee like uptick on that because cling sheet looked pretty nailed on there was loads of attacking potential there that didnt i didnt think that was going to backfire so that backfired and then i was contemplating for age to do sackur and bruno out and on saturday morning i did it for salah and minty and my gosh point swing was horrendous i think i worked out if i just sat on my team and not done any moves cba sacka and bruno would have got like 17 points and i took a hit to do it so i gained i gained one point so i was like 18 points down it was just it was just savage but a lot of people wouldnt say position because they got rid of sacka but its just not it was a bad outcome how do you feel about it going into the next few weeks happy well i ear marked game week six pretty sure im still going to wild card them because theres so many like little problems in my team well to kona is a problem moon is a problem i dont like the balance of having s and harand still hendersons been pretty crap i might get an arsenal defender back again so theres a and brenford so theres a few things id definitely like to change for game week six the team looks okay for this game week as if esas fit but well talk more about that in a minute lets at your team you got just bailed out by harand didnt you did you even start smith murray this week i did i started smith smith ran harlem were the only ones that did return for me this game week so it was poor and then to b off three people did return was not good right i put i put your your merry soldiers up there as well so 45 one point below you so i did hall to dunk and see all starting was annoying but they conceded didnt they i cant remember what happened in that game they did they two1 okay so dunk came in six points it was a free transfer so no points loss for hits or anything so that was nice and then watkins coming in clutch with 13 points which is great he is fairly low owned by the twitter bubble and people seem to just be put off by his minutes which i get and then smith row coming off the bench for j pedro i didnt see that bunching benching coming like no nobody knew about this random knock at all like so he just came back from his thing and from his internationals just he played like 45 minutes and not in the squad at all just so i think someones on twit said or on x or whatever that like they had the chance all these all these journalists were asking all these questions and nobody even asked about j pedros fitness at all no nobody even mentioned it so naturally nothing was said about it so is what it is and they havent said whether hes i dont think theyve given any specific update to if hes going to be back or not i heard it was something minor just to knock and he should be fine for the next one but well see so i am i benched cver in favor of porro attacking upside i thought and home fixture didnt think thered be a clean sheet for arsenal in there so i got i got bit in there a little bit but that sucks but saka getting return was decent coming in isa isac off at halim annoying hopefully hes fine this week the eye injury is what it says on so hope hes okay jotter again just a little bit disappointing he played 64 is minutes in the champions league so hopefully that means hell start again this weekend but he didnt look great in the champions league as far as ive heard so bourou for home is a great fixture for him but he needs to be scoring in the first 60 otherwise hes probably getting off with no points again so rogers as well like even last night in the champions league for villa like he started and at first he started he those 30 30 and he again didnt get any returns like all of the attacking mid all of the midfielders and watkins all got a return like a goal or assist and he once again got nothing and hes just flirting with any points isnt he just he looks good he looks good though i watched like the highlights of that game and hes always in dangerous positions and he obv did one preseason i think its just unlucky that he hasnt returned yet to be honest i have just s such a quandry of like who to start out him as smith row this weekend as well like im not sure that he could go either way hopefully well maybe isaac be injured and make a decision a bit easier for you but thats its its rough ill just bring up the some of the numbers from the weekend i think it was a bit of like a unusual one i just sort it by xg mateta was an interesting like one this weekend for me and other a owners it was irritating to see him take a penalty with something which i was like locked into thinking thats theres no question es on pens and another set pieces for palace so to see that like in the 90 whatever minute that he stepped up and took and then afterwards glasner said theyre going to be sharing penalties and its up to them toci side on the pitch i feel like matas such a big presence hes just going to take them anyway who was fou do i think it was it might have been s no i think it was s off top of my head i think he got the assist for the penalty so it wasnt even like he won it he played well and he i think its taken like that for me to think he could be a better option than e for like the well when palaces fixure is a bit better watkins was right at the top for xg as well at the weekend four big chances was the most of anyone im a bit jealous of not having him and you having him this weekend so but i feel like if it isaks out i do have the money there to go isach to watkins so youre not worried about his minutes hey watkins i think got that ankle knock but emry said it looked like it was going to be okay the john duran thing is there like he is like well but he did play 83 minutes in the premier league this weekend so his minutes in the premier league are at least trending upwards he looks like a beast doesnt he that goal he scored like at the weekend that was incredible that was amazing and that goal he scored last night that got ruled out was a cracking finish as well so maybe theyll get them starting together at some point but i just dont see i dont ever see watkins getting dropped for him like that just doesnt seem to be a thing like hes hes come in and scored two goals like when hes starting and hes just providing more assurance to emory that hes hes the nailed on starter so if they can find a way to play them both then great but is duran gonna be as good from the start in games i would say probably not but so i think im fine with his minutes as long as that angle thing in the champions league was not an issue like wolves at home absolutely great picture isnt it so good and i think at the moment ill be playing rogers ahead of smith r because smiths got newcastle at home which doesnt sound too bad either but rogers i surely this week hes gonna get something like hes gonna be a bit ofit troll isnt he but liking walkins at the moment and i think hes a good transfering for most people i think definitely and looking at some of the other numbers i was thinking about like as soon as munes was dropped to the bench and then last night it looks like hes definitely not first choice now cuz he played like in the a b team and i think he picked up a knock at the end so hes just been like tragically woeful for me and you were right that you said he just wasnt up to it and it was his like purple patch and it was in the im so happy i avoided him because i was i was so close to doing it and i just went for that j pedra instead and just j predra didnt play this week but hes been way up compared to mun i dont think munas has got any returns is he not even no hes got a single return in like the he should on paper have had like two of the easiest fixtures in ipswitch and leicester back to back and hes just hes just not done it so i was a bit disappointed about that but replacements i was thinking of like a who i would get in at that price bracket to replacing do you think if pedro isnt coming back for the weekend do you think welbecks a good a good shout this week his fixtures like longterm arent that great but im just trying to think if people are on wild card 6 whos there whos like a plum forward to get in this he could be we did just see liverpool blank against not and forest so the forest victure is probably not as juicy as we maybe think it was like thats the liverpool game has probably made me rethink that that this is so good to be honest or like well is theyre at home and brighton is scoring plenty of goals so maybe its not as bad as im maybe making out but im definitely going to be starting pedro im hoping hes fit but welbeck im not sure m should do fine his numbers from that like game were so awful i just didnt give any confidence maybe that brighton were pretty stifled like he had an xg of 00 and an xa of 02 and he only got like 70 minutes i was expecting 70 minutes but it wasnt i was expecting a little higher on both of those numbers i think if you havent gone well back already i think you just dont bother now to be honest no i no i think theyre theyre fixtures turn quite quickly after this i just had a quick look so after forest chelsea spurs newcastle and then wolves liverpool and city so the next run also you i personally dont mind chelsea and spurs like theyre theyre fine because theyre both not great defensively and then newcastle is be tough i think but then wolves at home but i think brighton are probably going to score against most teams and pedro and m you assume and well probably will be involved so i dont know is this fixture is a little bit like just worrying because of what liverpool did against them and al also while were still on strik as whist was someone who i was looking at for game week six got this ankle knock and hed been having like a great start as he 28 points in the first four game weeks and scored against city and highest xg of any like forward under like that 65 price bracket to have him not in the game is going to create a lot of opportunity i was quite interested in vard as a pick this game week thinking i know one we punts arent a thing before wild card but i just didnt like the idea of mo is potentially having a priz drop or just getting some skin in a different game but the fact that vards only had like three shots in the box this season and he scored them all just makes me think like how sustainable is that even against a very bad everton side so i was interested in vardy for a matter of about a minute vards goal scoring record in the premier league is top tier to be honest like whenever he has played like hes just gets tons of goals like 2122 15 goals three assists 20 21 got 15 goals 14 assists like 19 20 got 23 goals seven like before that 18 goals 20 goals before that 13 goals the 24 goals like every season hes in the prem like he scores so hes hes old now but like forms so far says hes just like if he gets the chances hell probably finish them i didnt expect him to come back and be like i know its only four games humle size i didnt come back expect him to come back into the league and be as i dont know as reliable as he has been two 90 minutes in the last two and i expect that hell start to play more 90s i think he played less at the start of the season because he didnt get much preseason but hes he surprised me in the fact that hes looking so n i think was it daa pon daer is meant to be like his injured longterm replacement but hes injured and hes in place over edward so but whats whats lesters like xg as a team its probably pretty low right lets have a quick look its like second bottom behind i switch or ahead of it switch so 33 is a big jump compared to i 15 but so its like his chances are going to be minimal but if hes going to finish everyone he gets then who get his first place absolutely just looking at the xgc of like expected goals con of this game week and everton up at 83 and theyve not played any big hitters either apart from spurs arguably but this season they played they played villa bournemouth and bri brighton as well so but there some of the results just whats whats the odds of like them going two n up again and then losing 32 i dont imagine if you put a bet on that like three weeks no theyve just not done well so far this season and leicester i wonder its a big weekend for like games at both ends of the table because youve got the this lester and everton game and youve got ipswitch and southampton playing each other based on like the start of the season those four right near the bottom for expected goals conceded down just number of points on the board so it could be a weekend to work out who is essentially going to be rel relegation candidates this season or this season and talking of like muns replacement dcl was one people started to look at as well but hes apparently ill so wont i think hes been almost pretty much nailed out ruled out sorry for this weekend which seems early for someone whos just ill on a wednesday or tuesday to be like hes ruled out of the weekend because hes just ill that seems strange to me but like his forms been okay like two blanks in the first two but then 12 points and six points and the two after that so he started to pick up some momentum and hes and hes been playing good minutes as well which is rare for him so he looks a little bit injuryf free at least so a shame look at the presses on friday or thursday whenever it is for them and hopefully he might get a pass of just being fit and people can get onto him so but i think he probably is a good options because those runner fixtures are good arent they its funny because if you if you someone that plays the fixtures which i am a little bit to try and like get on board of the form like someone like mcneel he just like no way an fpl like exciting pick but he has done well for that 55m bracket like hes hes on par with smith row if you were looking for a side sideways move and calv leen you just mentioned is or was performing at a similar level for slightly more expensive in a forward slot but its definitely not doesnt not exciting is he no i dont think id ever pick mcneil like ever just hes going to start blanking like he will score in some games but hes just hes just not an fpl pick for me no all right is there any anyone else you want to mention or should we just have a look at our teams for the weekend and some of our considerations what we might do lets move on lets go its a bit of a shorter show tonight so lets lets start with your team game five boys so at the moment i do have sber on the bench i was i was hurt by benching him last week they got three clean sheets out of four so far but it is man city away so that makes sense but maybe ill be bitten again on that but probably not i hope at le i hope at least they can stop harland scoring more than one that would be great so but s on the bench m wandry as i said earlier like smith row versus rogers to start is the only decision i have other than sl but s i think is just nail to the bench so who do you think you would go for at the moment im starting rogers because i think probably on paper that the smith rs fixture is harder but smith row showing way more maybe not such like form he is in form of like points but like rogers looks good on the ey test so i think youre probably right to be honest to start rogers wolves have been worse than newcastle defensively so i probably think i like that play to be honest id probably stick with it even though i think smith row has been good so far this season its difficult because youre youre picking you dont want to pick historical just because hes got points doesnt necessarily mean hes going to get some but then youre trying to base it on the fixture so i probably just about like a agree with you on that one to be honest sal captain probably the standout captain of the week bour for home great fixture bourman been quite good but they do concede goals at least so salah blanks last week its i just could see him being the first one to blank out of him in holland so unfortunate but blanks last night in the champions league so hopefully hes thirsty for more points this weekend thatd be good sacka you still going to play him i think he could probably get something against city theyre still liable to concede a couple j pedro im gonna start as well he should be fine like got decent enough back up on the bench isach unless i hear anything i think he should be fine too and its a good fixture hoping for points from trent porro has a decent up fixture but i think brenford will probably score and then dunk got home to forest i think its pretty good forest dont look that good at pack in and brighton have looked better defensively so i think on paper my team looks quite good hopefully this could be one week one week where i dont have to worry about holland no i think youre right is definitely one week you dont have to worry about holland i think with the double villa double liverpool and pedro i think youre pretty prime there if they have big games i dont see theres going to be like loads of rotation even though its like the first champions league week of the season but it maybe a little bit it was interesting that slot said last night that he was going to start gakpo in the game at the weekend but he came back a bit fresher so thats hints towards that hes he will make fresh lets say freshness based decisions in his front fre which is fair enough and youd expect that so j and j gapco coming off early at the weekend maybe suggests that jotter and gap cod could start but then diaz has been his starter in the premier league so i think it probably will be still so are you still thinking about wild carding soon or you quite happy because you not no plans to get harand still or have changed since last week no its still not changed but im thinking probably like a seven wild cup maybe eight just because i want to keep liverpool for those two six and seven with those walls away crystal palace away i might move j off at that time if he starts like getting benched but i want salah for so im thinking seven or eight okay what and then at that point you got need strong to still keep salah then and not have or just a bit too far ah had to think about not sure to be i might pivot at that point because whats hollands fixtures like after eight i havent even looked theyre nice they are well after eight let me just double check i know seven hes got fulham i think eight hes got southampton at home which is you a game youd probably want him for so no sorry southampton homes in n in nine so its wolves away in eight southampton then bouth brighton spurs then its is pretty good isnt it hes just got this tricky game next against arsenal which i think might be another nil or one no youre right i dont think hes going to do big hauling this game fair shame that im going to have to buy him for 153 if i if i go there i like the like that three odd million that im going to have to like downgrade someone to would be probably getting rid of trent in my team like that which doesnt feel great no i like it okay any more to say on that one no just watkins double race again would be nice id get the vice captaincy you probably havent said that yet vice captaincy on probably put on i think he him and rogers look good for this week so here i look at this and just think it looks like a mess but maybe it isnt too bad so henderson in go like you ive got trent porro and coner this week so typical as well like ive played coner twice this season against leicester and against everton and theyve conceded and then they kept a clean sheet in the champions league last night i was like come on man so frustrating so got that backline the midfield is a bit of a mix at the minute so you can tell its a salah and harand team recently ive got salah smith r minty and a e got another goal and assist last night in the league cup game so his numbers in non premier league competitions this season have been so good so maybe finally again united against southampton i know you didnt watch much of that one but i watched the first half and the game flipped when anana saved the penalty but they were so open against i can see palace winning to be honest i could see them winning as well like i think theres a bit of a but even though as a united fan there was like the huge result last night and they won at the weekend but i dont think from watching that southampton game anythings changed and i feel like if palace are on it they could easily win that game and that i think is probably a better game for ez to return a bit like that chelsea game where hes got slightly more space so happy about that min i dont know what to expect there munes has lost his place i feel like the team is looking like its ready for a wild card its like limping towards one could maybe this week but and leave some arsenal players on the bench but that would just be such a bad decision after taking a minus four last week just to get salah specifically for this so i dont think i can do that and then talking about isach i agree i think hes probably going to be all right if hes not im going to get watkins if munice is out ive got enough money to do winks to rogers and play rogers cuz i think that fixture looks good or i can get any full under like 6m and id maybe get jedro if he looks like hes going to be fit so theres a couple of different options to get on one of those fixures i dont necessarily like the double up against forest youre right because they were good defensively last week so maybe more likely i get rogers so ive got an attacking output in that game so well ill see about that what do you think or lack of attacking output in that game true ey test output i dont know what do you think you do with mois like definitely going to get rid of him im just trying to think who else is like thats why i came across like vardy and even dcl cuz i thought that game was going to be quite open but whats that evan nelsons fixtures for bourma i think theyre quite tough hes playing way against we got remember im probably going to wild card in game week six so they its only just probably going to be one week then hes only had one like three shots all season i dont know about that but i it maybe i think its probably him or j pedro no but im im pretty sure munis isnt going to start and i dont fancy robinson keeping a clean sheet against newcastle and it seems counterproductive playing isack as well so its either its either winks to rogers and plays three whos brenford got this week tottenham away okay would you consider that sharda guy because whis is out i dont know if hes a forward in the game not sure maybe im just no hes down as a midfielder 54 its a shame no probably not to be honest but hes someone i no i cant get i can get to rogers from winks i think ive got point six and jackson could you get there jackson what chelsea jackson no i think hes 75 is he that expensive i think he is 76 w okay so options are pretty limited but i dont know chris wood hes got liverpool hes got ntia nika maybe thats double palace attack and theyve not been like so i know it just its choosing from like a shower of so its either p vardy who hasnt got like great underlying data against a bad everon and rely on him getting one shot and scoring and getting nine points or get rogers be frustrated for an hour and get two or three points s in the chat but back calio punt im not sure hes a forward either is he i dont think he is he scored i know he did well in the i think he did well in the league cup last night i think he got a gold and two assist two assists let me double check caral now hes a mid hes 48 and hes he will be a great option once he starts to play in the prem he is a good player i do quite like that sh but i i think ill definitely know more for i want another week even though im expecting like another red arrow i think another week of just getting a few more just know a few more minutes ideas maybe some penalty takers i dont know well see winks to galo if hes looks like hes goingon to start and just drop mun to the bench could be okay i think it probably go that way so probably and captain c this week is probably quite easy i got sal to captain him this week while holland has this difficult awaken i think thats pretty straightforward isnt it this week i think its going to be one of those weeks where like the template bounces back about a little bit like most good players i think could get some returns last week was a bit of a drab one but this week i feel like hes just going to come back and trents gonna get his first attack of return and everyone will be happy this week no i feel like that happen sometimes after the international break like theres some funny results theyve been away so long its just just so gut like i cant believe already in game we four eight 18 points down off a hit gone just and when the hit includes trent and salah as well i was just thinking its never going to not come in hopefully that the guys on a youtube channel can get into the one million ranks at least sometimes too nice harry in the chat said not just us hes got 40 points and down 37m as well so hes going to keep plugging away but i feel like its its been a tough start and then i was having a look at like some of the i think fpl fol will maybe put on twitter like one of the account one of the people thats like 11th in the world made no transfers and the teams like fairly template and you just think god anyway must have harand does he have both i think he has just harland he has just harand hes probably got diaz in there he did have diaz and then he like he diaz was the only other and co will maybe were the only other non like template picks but it made me think blind thats quite like a template team and doing so well with no transfers i think hes 11th in the world man new pork jobs hes got a big at the back gabrielle trent porro and rea okay a lot of people have done well with raya havent they people wild card in game four or three all picked rea theyve been doing well on him his ownership is so high for a goalkeeper this season cool like sanchez at chelsea could start to be an okay west ham away brighton at home forest at home next three liverpool after that but then and new and united and arsenal after that so that four doesnt look great but maybe saves and stuff like that so absolutely all right any more to add tonight i dont think so just salah returns that would be great exactly i want big salah returns and smallish how returns what do you think the score in that game is going to be which one the arsenal city aral city game i think both teams score so like a 21 city maybe okay bit more probably har bracing it be honest he was poor against arsenal last season at the etad it wasnt nil wasnt it i would think surely like ca and gabrielle ted team can best in i hope its not boring though i feel like last seasons game at yes it was boring but i think its incentive for city to go for it because just because arsenal already points thats and they play thursday doesnt that suck they play thursday evening away and city play tonight at home in the champions league feel like thats an unfair advantage as well indeed anyway all right cool well be back next week thanks everyone for joining us this short show well back next week with a slightly longer one thanks so,5789

well I'm actually can I be honest I've been thinking today about something which is quit elpl yeah quit an elite FPL and just you know you Ray and D can take over D yeah yeah um no I was thinking actually about Marcus rashford and how at 6.9 he scores against bar the two goals could it be you know give it a game see how he plays if he scores you know I don't know I'm just thinking in my head like should I should I should I do something a bit risky um and a little bit of left field well no one else is thinking about it so I don't know it's too maybe it's it's cuz I used support man united isn't it let's be honest it's because um but yeah support what a great link who who's here in the live who's who's who's in the live chat saying hello Jay uh kathan's in the chat is p yes he's not

you haven't done your favorite line a moderator is actually here friend of the show yeah yeah yeah is that is that ai ai in fact you need to check out launch pod Studio's X account Jace and look at the ai ai bot I have no I I have no interested I'm not saying you're interested but you'd be fascinated like you sent me those videos oh my God you the videos oh my God those videos you sent me well this is frightening the one of James it's you retweeted it so is it launch pod stud launch pod Studios or as I used used to call it Launchpad yeah I got it yeah launch AI Avatar yeah no way that's an AI Avatar content and share stories across the globe from it godive growth in recent years podcasting has become an and so you basically take a picture of self give it to AI write a script that is weird I need do you know I was thinking of you and James in a gay way I was thinking of you and James actually yesterday in the car driving down here and I was thinking the way he is on FPL juice is identical to you you two need to get a room together and just it makes no sexual relation wait this is escalating you two need to get together short this stream's ending in in two minutes and and well in that video he's talking about how it's good to have a two-way conversation on a podcast and I would love to sit and just watch you and James talk to one another I think you'd be just mesmerized the pair of you just talking just the knowledge that you both have about this industry is um it's just through the roof really but no Jace in all seriousness you wild carded like me are you well are you happy with your wild card hindsight you never get them all gone you're not happy at all delete them delete them who you not happy with everyone n Nate come on no no I am listen can we just can we just like stop with these absolute answers you it it's one game we after a wild card I can't be unhappy you're thinking of rashford hm I am actually yeah I am Chris fixtures aren't bad fixtures aren't bad what are the fixtures cryst Palace away Spurs Crystal pal away Spurs at home Aston Villa away okay that's not easy brenford at home West Ham away Chelsea I mean I think I think you know what I think rashford could be one for who Franco and then downgrade Alexander Arnold to maseri she gonna do a minus four yeah just for two players you know but you know what I just feel in my bones I have this feeling in my bones man in all seriousness you said at the start of the series you said at the start of the the season that you genuinely just don't care and you're going to do what you want why don't you just do it then seriously if you if you really feel deep deep down that this could potentially pay off would it be because then I'd be benching wck or Pedro who would you bench out of those two amazing players Pedro probably Pedro he'll score brace oh God chat what do you think should I do it I don't know if anyone's actually watching this anymore but if you are do you think I should do the rashford in it's it's I I don't think it's the worst thing man so you you would take you would take out i' go with the 352 and take out franker yeah and Trent Alexander Arnold yes for Masari and rashford rashford because of because of what the fact that he scored two goals against Chris bonley did you watch the game no so how how did he perform I mean what what what all of a sudden is this is this is just this is just um impulse I guess but you know what I don't care man I'm just going to do it but you know you know what do you know what I could just go crazy do something really crazy could I can you even afford it I can yeah you and how much have you got left in the bank I'd have no money left in the bank but I could I could get Pedro out for a 4.5 def forward yeah and then upgrade goalkeeper as well let take Aus 12 for a minus eight no it' beus 12 wouldn't it J Jase I think I mean I encourage this just do it I don't you do the minus 12 I think you I think this illness has got brain yeah this is this isn't like you this is you thinking way too outside the box at the moment way too out you're you're making Alex Volo thanks for the thumbnail we keep forgetting to say at the start you're making who the best goalkeeper to have at the moment Chat best goalkeeper Ray yeah yeah Ry probably well no there's no doubt in it is Ry yeah even though someone's gonna be screaming but they got Man City I could have yeah man city have don't worry no no no no no no no no no no what you what you think Man City Sanchez Sanchez for Chelsea could be a good show uh well the manager came out and said he is number one but you can't really trust him but is a pretty okay Chelsea defensively are terrible forun says says CM who Harland for mooners yeah funny mate you're funny yeah you're one of the few people that own harand that's doing rather few people one of the few people you mean one of the I know 69.5% yes of the game yeah reyer in for Henderson and then Lanier whatever his name is the 4.5 I mean I can't do a minus 12 can I you can but again I'm sitting here thinking you've lost the plot this isn't this isn't the time to be it is the time this this is the one hour of the week where you get to to to to to to sift around with your team and then you don't think about it until Sunday surgery oh God what are the I mean in all seriousness what what are the chat saying I may actually bring it up myself to be honest with you not much at the moment they're not actually say they're not actually saying much at the moment it's great isn't it Sean is saying

I've got no um well Winnie the Pooh hold on a minute Winnie the Poo he's saying do it do it Chase come with us I've got a feeling it's gonna work join us jaas I've got a feeling this is gonna work I'm done it it's done it's freaking done mate you've done it yeah it's on my screen if you see it if that's not worth a subscribe or a like I don't know what it is Pedro Jo Pedro first sub Henderson you're going to have to get me a load of save points are you going to be playing mazari Ma who yeah yeah I'll play Masari so a team that lost what was it one nil to Crystal Palace last year happening this year he who dares wins my friend as as Andrew Ferguson would say look at that team and tell me that that not got points in it this week well tell Henderson is in goal against the player that you just brought in right yeah hang on hang on shush right I need to play some epic music give me a second there we are Alex wallet you can create that as a thumbnail this sad face Winnie the Poo here we go and get ready for this I'm going to play some epic epicness here we go in goal we have there we go Henderson the mighty Henderson who's going to let in six goals at home to Manchester United however it might be too loud might be too loud CH we go is that better is that better Henderson against Manchester United he's going to let in six goals but he's going to get 12 saves Yes you heard it here right here this is the best content here for FPL or the best advice and tips to win your mini leagues all your money back dunk joins H dunk are home to naam Forest the mighty nutam forest who will not score against the man the myth the legend Lewis dunk next to we've got Maz rowy who's come in bit of an injury scare last week but it's all right he's fine he's fine he's fit and healthy away at Crystal Palace could get on could get a cheeky assist at steo you never know could outscore friend Alexander Arnold which I would laugh my head off if he did he's obviously got Bournemouth home which is a [ __ ] I didn't realize that then we've got Lewis Ric leis who has not guaranteed his place in the in the squad um at Manchester City but he's let's be honest he's he should be playing he's playing tonight uh yeah then we've got and then okay we've got and then we've got the Midfield five the insane Midfield five of Saka for Arsenal up against City who's going to be on yeah he'll be on set pieces he'll be in the fck of it he's on penalties isn't he steo odard not in there he's not injured is he he's not freaking injured get out of well L Diaz he trained today Le Diaz for Liverpool who's uh hopefully playing more than 60 minutes we got Mo Salah did you did you not read Anna slot's comments about the fact that Diaz would have gapo would have started ahead of Diaz the other day if it wasn't for I can't remember what it was now tired a chance that Diaz may not start gpos crap why would you play him over SL SL he played him last night Salah Madu again is another assassin CU of the am of players at Chelsea have got oh uh so i' I've got a really strong bench to come on anyway actually to be fair my bench is brilliant Saka Diaz Salah madai and finally rashford as a new addition into that Midfield then we've got Welbeck Yes you heard it right it's not 2014 it's 2024 Danny Welbeck is coming back and he's coming back with a vengeance he's my Vice Captain no he's not uh then we've got Hal Harland joining him up front on the bench we've got fabianski who's let's be honest not even worth mentioning then we've got Pedro first sub Pedro first sub steo Pedro first sub um do you think it's a mistake putting him as first sub do you think I should drop someone else well that game's got nil nil One n either way written all over it so no I think it's fine okay uh Grieves for for uh lip switch up against Southampton and then we've got face against Everton I think I might put Face's second sub what you reckon face home well I was contemplating playing Greaves but now I'm going to play what do you think that Greaves is better to play of a face oh yeah Lester R Us its defensively ler a useless def I'd rather play Greaves you're talking about a team in Southampton who can't he got G got a bloody clean sheet didn't he last week yeah last week yeah fortuitously but it doesn't matter he he was on he was no he wasn't there no near monus points okay well there we go that's that's that anyway and um we can we can finish that so that's my team so there we go what do we move on to now I've just made a insane transfer I don't even know why I did that but you know he who dares wins well like I said if if that's not worth a like everybody make sure you are hitting the Subscribe button and like button it's got to be worth how many people are watching on XJ maybe they could come on over and uh hit the like button and subscribe um I don't think I posted it mate no no no uh let me find out no no I have I have I have all right I have I have all right He Who Dares win don't don't uh don't we've got on X we've got 37 people on x 37 people on X watching us hello to all of you awesome people right okay 39 people on on there's so many people streaming at the moment then there's no one watching F no there is and there's champions league as well okay yeah exactly yeah exactly in exactly uh in fact jaay we've got efl cup where Brighton are playing tonight so I will check the teams I think Brighton are playing wolves I believe it is and then you got Tottenham playing tonight as well so I'm going to deliberately check the see so yeah oh Brighton are already two n up and it's B balaba and ad dingra with the goals so not Pedro or well Beck or Pedro playing well and is on the bench no Pedro oh no Pedro oh dear well it's all right I've got him on the bench anyway um let's let's let's look at your team have you done um okay I better open Discord up then um have you got the um the chat up in front of you steo uh Sean says in the chat if anyone was laughing at this content just remember every other FPL content creator said that Henderson and kungu and E were must owns do people laugh at I hope people laugh with us Jay that's that's what I'm hoping people do I'm hoping that people laugh along share the content make sure you're commenting after the stream yeah let us know what you think that's the key let us know what you're thinking I love the fact I love when you when you do the whole sarcastic yeah what's that from you'll have to give me the context I don't know like when when um when when you do streams and you're just like you make a comment and then you just make like a real quick like yeah just it tickles me it tickles me it's me at a Tom from juice that takes the mick out of me for taking the mick out of him for constantly going yeah it's mental whenever you do it whenever you do it when I'm watching you on stream I just laugh I'm like what it's it's every Londoner Jay every every Londoner is just yeah drives you at the wall it's it's that and the face you pull it's it's anyway U so we got for Bugan ver Bugan in goal kinate Alexander Arnold Lewis buo Palmer Salah de bruyne Cal and Watkins it's it's a very very a very stacked team for those that want to know what the bench is Rogers Duncan Greaves in that order um so you've got um Rogers coming on against wolves in the event of a no show from Pedro which is well I may replace him with I may put no it will be Rogers for his two-pointer he's a freak though Jay have you seen him play genuinely Rogers yeah no oh he's he is absolutely phenomenal but so what you're saying is I should have got him in instead of rashford no no no no no no I'm not saying that but what I am saying is that he's a very frustrating player to own in the sense of he does everything about he does everything but score FPL points yeah he even in the game against whoever Watkins was playing the other day who was wat who was Aston Villa playing the other day I complet oh Everton there was a moment where I jumped out of my bed where Rogers put the ball across to Watkins but he just put it too far behind him and Watkins looked at him like dude put it there and it was one of those moments where you're like yeah Rogers ain't going to come with anything he's a very very forward thinking player I know Mark goldbridge is a massive fan of his but certainly I mean in all seriousness the title of the the the stream is you know Calbert Le and Captain Alex Vol is doing it so so the ti stream isn't you doing it it's Alex Vol it doesn't say anybody's doing it it's just it just says c l and Alex Vol is doing he he went he Captain ISAC respect man mad respect if he's going to do it fair play I mean they're up against Leicester I'm expecting one something like that I think going up against because Alex Vol I believe owns Holland and Salah I think or just Holland I can't remember now he's doing very well this year like really well he's like 300K 200k something like that W so he's just he's just gonna go for it well this is what what Alex Volo does isn't it he comes up with these incredible thumbnails he comes up with these incredible ideas regarding his but he admits himself he watches lots and lots of football and looks more deeper into the way teams set up and how certain players perform against certain defenses and he's personally come to the conclusion that Cal Luen for him is his best captaincy over the various other players he's got I don't know I don't know where he is in the YouTube chat league but he's going to be within reason at least in the top 30 but certainly he is gonna be going for it and I will have a look now to see where Alex Volo is in the YouTube chat he's got to be in the top 30 because he's okay he's probably dropped down to about 400,000 after the Isaac blank which is very very unfortunate for you well I'm 118th in the YouTube chat League 118th yeah Alex is 79th okay okay 79th then so he's only 11 points more than us was that it yeah well like I said me and you are only me and you were 28 points of dread FPL and yet he's 400k yeah Alex Vol is dropped at 1.5 million okay okay what's his team his team is arolo and goal oh no that was previous weeks but cono Lewis Alexander Ronald dunk Salah as a Rogers kudas um very interesting um pick there Harland and Isaac up top so if he's gonna go with calv lein it would be in for Isaac right I'm assuming so I think he may have well carded is he injured is it injured we got a knock or something he got a knock he got a bit of blood Vision that's he took off proportion nothing serious nothing serious 40 people tuning in on YouTube hit the like button if you join it uh hello everyone on X if you're tuning in on X uh hit us up on social media Elite FPL jump into our Discord

it would been funny ass you're lucky that I uh right so let's go to this game week so we're going on Saturday uh lunchtime kickoff steo are you excited for this game week do you think this could be a pivotal game week for the early season where people are making crazy decisions like bringing in man united players I have a feeling that this week could be one of those where the ones that failed last week could do quite well this week the players that kind of blanked last week they've got favorable fixtures the likes of Palmer away at West Ham for instance the likes of Liverpool at home to Bournemouth astonvilla at home to walls Tottenham at home to brenford brenford away at Tottenham Crystal Palace at home to man united there's some favorable fixtures jaay and I think that you know I'm going to be covering the 3M kickoffs so I think United away I think United away at Palace is going to be one that's going to shock I don't see where you're getting this from Crystal Palace this year haven't been exactly bad they just aren't getting the results that we expect I mean I'm looking at it here they lost two to brenford two n to Crystal Palace sorry two-nil to West Ham they beat Norwich 40 in the cup and then it's 1-1 two2 then they beat Queens Park Rangers in the cup 2-1 just a good feeling mate it's just a good feeling I can't say game man united we'll get we'll get to it anyway we'll get the last two results against man united I don't F yeah we'll get to it yeah but I I I'm looking for I'm looking forward in answer your question I am looking forward to this game we I think it could be quite high scoring okay West Ham versus Chelsea lunchtime is is the simple answer I think I think you're lagging mate personally uh uh West H versus Chelsea TNT Sports at halfast 12 um a game where of course lot Palmer owners will be looking hopefully to get some FPL points for them for the amount of money they've invested in him I've got madaki which I'm hoping will start the game I think he will um West Ham um yeah don't think I mean kudus for aalo but anyone anyone else that may own any uh West Ham players I don't think so I think majority of their eyes and focus will be on Chelsea I think that Chelsea have got it in them to win this 2-1 so I think West Ham one Chelsea Two steo do you want to uh get yourself up to speed and give us your thoughts on this uh West Ham so far this season actually surprised me genuinely they they've come away with some decent results I mean that last gasp one-1 draw versus Fulham I mean of course Bowen gets the bloody assist which is very frustrating but I think West Ham performed okay H they lost 2-1 to Aston Villa and that's like the opening day of the Season where you know Aston Villa pretty much a settled team whereas West Ham were a bunch of put togethers Crystal Palace they lock they beat 2- n they then beat Bournemouth in the cup one nil then they lost to Man City like they always did they looked terrible against Man City 3-1 and then up against a Fulham team who looked very very well organized until literally the 96th minute or whatever it was where they conceded to make it one1 this fixture though it's the home team that likes to to get the results so we've got a West Ham these are all home wins 3-2 to West Ham 1- nil Chelsea 2-1 Chelsea West 3-1 Chelsea 5- nil so the history suggesting actually this to be a West Ham Victory I think the way Chelsea were playing the other day I I really did expect them to score more goals versus Bournemouth and vice versa I think Bournemouth should have scored as well I did predict a high scoring game in that but it ended up being one n I'm gonna go Jace with a I'm gonna go I'm gonna go two2 I'm gonna go two2 Jace okay two end to end okay Aston Villa versus wolves is the first of the three o'clocks I'm going to mention um I just think people that own Ole Watkins are going to be happy again um well again um I think it's going to be two two nil to ask ason Villa this game I think Aston Villa win comfortably and um no response from wolves um your thoughts again I'm not really being particularly Blown Away by Aston Villa the results have been wins my God they can see 21 2 N 2-1 32 okay they got a 3-0 win against young boys last night Ole Watkins did come off yesterday although unan R has said that he was tactical foot underneath ice not great I still am saying that Matson if Matson was an option you've got to get him in your team he is a phenomenal Talent unfortunately he's just not that option and against woles a team in which it's been very low scoring between these two teams a few one ones in there couple of one yeah I'm just gonna go with a I'm gonna go 2-1 Jace to Aston Villa okay Fulham versus Newcastle is next on the list um I don't have any horses in this race I know people do have the likes of Smith run is um I guess um the defender what's his name um Newcastle Defender uh Robinson what who him Robin you're thinking of no I'm on about Newcastle Defenders oh no one's got them apart from Dan burn if anybody now Dan burn that's it that's the guy they've all sold L Hall yeah um I think that this is going to be the munis Breakthrough that f waai for I think he'll score but I think Newcastle will score I'm going to go one0 munis to score start will he munis he was benched the other day I think he'll adely that was after International duty but one off at me but yeah well the last the last four fixtures in fact five out of the last six Newcastle have one to nil got 2-0 1 nil 3 n 2 nil 1 nil I actually agree with you jaay though I think these two teams are going to cancel each other out and I Fulham have looked really good defensively this year and I've kind of regretted selling Robinson I'm gonna yeah I'm going to go one-1 Jay okay um then we got Leicester versus Everton people clambering to get Jamie vder in javard in um obviously instigated a price Rise um was it last night the night before um making him what 5.7 now is that right yeah um still I mean if it's if it's a glimpse of what um the past Jamie vardy has done it could be a steal at 5.7 against Everton a team that are pretty awful um in most aspects um I think that leester are also awful I think that this is going to be one of these games where it's going to be a nil nil or it's going to be a high-scoring game I and I don't know which to choose from um a game of lots of Misses is basically what I'm saying or a game where we start to see people just scoring for fun um I'm G to meet it in the middle and I'm gonna go with a I'm gonna I'm G I'm going to go two all well interestingly enough the last time these two played was on the 1st of May 2023 and it ended 22 wow calit lein scores a penalty your mate face assisted centu James Madison assisted Jamie vardy and then AI made it 22 in the 55th minute I think this game is going to end up either nil nil or 1-1 and I'm just going to go with one1 Jace okay uh Liverpool then face uh Bournemouth uh at anfield I was actually up at Liverpool today I to drive up to um a place called witness witness yeah just outside Liverpool um I had to do for work I had to um how long does that take to get there uh actually where I went to just over two hours not too bad okay okay yeah it wasn't too bad um right uh I think Liverpool are going to win this 31 I think Bournemouth is going to score I think it's going to be an annoying for a lot of people who own double Liverpool or triple Liverpool players I think it'll be 3-1 okay well interestingly enough it ended 3-1 back on the 19th of August 2023 Jay wow I haven't got theory in front of me who scored the the Bournemouth goal in the third minute and they play for Bournemouth now oh for God's sake popular a popular FPL asset m i I hang on so they play for B now I have no idea um very popular asset seeno yes yeah yeah no it wasn't seeno yeah and on that day it was lucky was a really really lucky guess it was Diaz Salah and jotter that got the goals for Liverpool in a 3-1 win mallister was sent off that day yeah I I you you're saying 3-1 I think Liverpool have got enough in the tank to keep a clean sheet here the history actually against Bournemouth is very very good we got a for these are all Liverpool wins 2-1 9 N 31 21 and 40 I think Liverpool will do a professional job I think it's G to be a low score though I'm going to go two-nil jaay okay one second please just give me a second I don't know why but it's just doing some weird stuff there for me right okay so next we've got Southampton versus ipswitch no no no no yeah yeah there's been a lot of well there's been a lot of Glory for the away team Southampton winning 5-2 then we got a 1-1 1-1 1 nil 1 nil and then the last time these two played was 32 to ipswitch but the last time ipswitch were away at Southampton ended 1 nil to I switch I would not be surprised if that was to happen again and yeah you know what Jace I'm gonna go one- one okay I've just seen the Man City kit it looks awful it does look awful um one okay so uh we've got uh Spurs versus brenford Sonny Boy um 2-1 Spurs two one Spurs well Brent like Man City they don't mind playing him and they do not mind playing Tottenham whatsoever they did lose 3-2 last time out but before that 22 3-1 brenford 22 nil nil Tottenham jaas I don't if you're aware of this their form has been really really bad lot of 11 games or so I heard a lot of supporters ringing up and all talk Sport and they were complaining about an ball just being lackluster no plan no clear sounds a bit sounds very similar to what they were saying about Man United last season so I mean I I just think that uh I think it needs to click again for them I think they have just gone through a tough time I think um they need to get get scoring and um son needs to be more involved and be more attacking uh when he drifts on to the right hand side I think he just becomes non-existent um so so yeah if he's on if he's on the uh the wing he's just not been involved D in the action and I think they need to get him in the middle of the pitch um so yeah um what do I say what was I say the score was going to be 2-1 another another 2-1 yeah what about you the fact that brenford have lost Visa is not good I don't know he comes in I don't know if it'll be cavalo who steps up and plays the ambero role and urmo takes over Visa spot I really don't know but I think that if brenford had Visa I think that I'd be probably tempted to go with a brenford win I do like the 2-1 to Tottenham and despite the fact that history suggesting brenford could get a result I think the loss of Visa is going to be a lot more hard than what people think and I'm GNA go yeah I do think brenford score though hopefully on Burma comes through with something and yeah I'm going to go with yeah like you Jay's 2-1 to Tottenham Now we move on to the the evening game which is uh the Crystal Palace Man United game I'm actually uh quite confident in this one I do think United will win this and you're going to be quite surprised but I'm thinking I'm going to go with 3-1 to Manchester United that's 3-1 to Manchester United Crystal Palace won unit three Steve hasn't got a clue why I'm thinking this but um let me just say I'm just I just feel confident going into this game okay well the last last time these two played at a 3-1 win was a was actually a friendly Jace back on the 19th of July 2022 man united won 31 and oh I can't get any information up that's a shame I was hoping to get some information up and maybe SC okay well what I'll do then about testing time man united no no no no the last time man united actually beat Crystal Palace was on the 26th of September so we're kind of approaching that date last year 2023 the question for you though jaay of the three goals how many did rash would get one nope last season in in the in the efl cup oh sorry in the out of the three goals he scored out the three goals what did rashford do did he get two no he did absolutely nothing he didn't even play wasn't even on the bench it was Garo casmiro casemiro seemed to have the game of his life and martial the newly well I say newly he's just went to a new club today didn't he where was it AK Athens or something I don't have a clue but he's joined a new club today and yeah that's the last time man united actually beat Crystal Palace it was a depleted uh Crystal Palace team I'm sorry to say this jaas I do think you'll score against Man United against Crystal Palace but I think Crystal Palace beat you and I'm going to go with 2-1 okay well I hope you're wrong um then we move on to the Sunday games and we've got Brighton versus nothingham Forest uh where I'm gonna have my man Pedro on the bench um St you go first on this one well looking at the history here there's a lot of Threes a lot of Threes jaay maybe benching Pedro could be could be a way in which you may be like better not actually bench him we got a three rord we got a three 32 and the last time these played each other ended one nil to to to Brighton there's a lot of Threes here Jace I I'm expecting this to be quite low scoring the Notting of forest defensively I think Nuno has has done something with Notting of forest which he did did with Wolves which is just basically make him very difficult to beat and even though Nottingham Forest create a lot of chances they can't seem to put the ball in the back of the net they did a job on Liverpool last week and agree with you col I think that I think this is going to end up being like a one I'm gonna go one1 one nil one nil Bri what do you agree with Coleman what what's that one nil two right one0 to Brighton yeah well coincidentally that's what happened last year there we go hisory repeats who scored the goal though for Brighton come on Jay mate testing your bright I don't have knowledge of Brighton I have no you do you're a massive Brighton fan and this player is who Le dunk no oh he was the best performing Defender that day if anybody in the chat gets this I mean they can easily a current Brighton player now shall I just say it's a trick question is it an own goal yeah it's well I'll give I'll give you the who the who scored the own goal it was that well-known not Forest player Andrew omo bedelli who right move on yeah right moving on Manchester City versus Arsenal in the uh the in the late afternoon kickoff um great game this could a good watch could be a good watch um do expect C to win this I'm going to go Manch Manchester City to win this 32 three two are you I'm going to do a you here are you taking the piss you're joking right 3-2 jaay the last time man city scored more than two goals against in fact more than well when they scored three or more goals against Arsenal was on the 26th of April 2023 since then Arsenal have done very very well which player we're going to get Ste an Aral shirt this season CH which player scored twice and got an assist for Man City that day Dan maybe you can share yours with him don't need to wash it who got the two goals and ass say again I wasn't listen what what was the question man City beat Arsenal 4-1 that day who got two goals and an assist what year last uh 202 oh Kevin De bruyne Kevin De bruy oh how do you remember that I just remember him getting two goals and assists against Arsenal yeah hen got and I didn't I didn't own him well hanen got a goal and assist I'm I'm thinking of going with on the score prediction super Brew one nil to Man City it was a game we that I got him in after that I think I I got him in after that and he blanked and he blanked and he blanked I think three games in a row after that yeah said to Ray on the voice message I'm hoping that Kevin De bruyne turns up in this game just to before I bring in sacka and2 could do a lot no I'm going one nil to Man City I think this is going to be a g because Arsenal playing Thursday they're playing THS away so I think it's GNA have a big factor in it I think Arsenal are going to defend for their life I think Ray is going to do really well but I expect Man City to win one nil probably howand with the goal as well but the last three three games have ended 1 one 1 nil and nil nil and that's one nil in Arsenal's favor so he knows what he's doing artetta he knows what he's doing odard could be a b creativity that's the only downside is odard missing for the creativity but I think they're so defensive well I don't think they're so defensively solid that I think the move this year is to have rea and Gabrielle Gabrielle

game week five whereas for you dont i think you may have potential problems may have unlikely well it all depends doesnt it all depends on if pedro plays well we hell play hell be fine well im can i be honest ive been thinking today about something which is quit elpl quit an elite fpl and just you ray and d can take over d no i was thinking about marcus rashford and how at 69 he scores against bar the two goals could it be give it a game see how he plays if he scores i dont know im just thinking in my head like should i should i should i do something a bit risky and a little bit of left field well no one else is thinking about it so i dont know its too maybe its its cuz i used support man united isnt it lets be honest its because but support what a great link whos here in the live

its one game we after a wild card i cant be unhappy youre thinking of rashford hm i am i am chris fixtures arent bad fixtures arent bad what are the fixtures cryst palace away spurs crystal pal away spurs at home aston villa away okay thats not easy brenford at home west ham away chelsea i think i think what i think rashford could be one for who franco and then downgrade alexander arnold to maseri she gonna do a minus four just for two players what i just feel in my bones i have this feeling in my bones man in all seriousness you said at the start of the series you said at the start of the season that you genuinely just dont care and youre going to do what you want why dont you just do it then seriously if you if you feel deep down that this could potentially pay off would it be because then id be benching wck or pedro who would you bench out of those two amazing players pedro probably pedro hell score brace god chat what do you think should i do it i dont know if anyones watching this anymore but if you are do you think i should do the rashford in its its i dont think its the worst thing man so you would take you would take out i go with the 352 and take out franker and trent alexander arnold yes for masari and rashford because of because of what the fact that he scored two goals against chris bonley did you watch the game no so how did he perform what all of a sudden is this is this is just this is just impulse what i dont care man im just going to do it what do what i could just go crazy do something crazy could i can you even afford it i can you and how much have you got left in the bank id have no money left in the bank but i could i could get pedro out for a 45 def forward and then upgrade goalkeeper as well let take aus 12 for a minus eight no it beus 12 wouldnt it j jase i think i encourage this just do it i dont you do the minus 12 i think you i think this illness has got brain this is this isnt like you this is you thinking way too outside the box at the moment way too out youre youre making alex volo thanks for the thumbnail we keep forgetting to say at the start youre making who the best goalkeeper to have at the moment chat best goalkeeper ray ry probably well no theres no doubt in it is ry even though someones gonna be screaming but they got man city i could have man city have dont worry no what you what you think man city sanchez for chelsea could be a good show well the manager came out and said he is number one but you cant trust him but is a pretty okay chelsea defensively are terrible forun says cm who harland for mooners funny mate youre funny youre one of the few people that own harand thats doing rather few people one of the few people you mean one of the i know 695 yes of the game reyer in for henderson and then lanier whatever his name is the 45 i cant do a minus 12 can i you can but again im sitting here thinking youve lost the plot this isnt this isnt the time to be it is the time this is the one hour of the week where you get to sift around with your team and then you dont think about it until sunday surgery god what are the in all seriousness what are the chat saying i may bring it up myself to

that as a thumbnail this sad face winnie the poo here we go and get ready for this im going to play some epic epicness here we go in goal we have there we go henderson the mighty henderson whos going to let in six goals at home to man utd however it might be too loud might be too loud ch we go is that better is that better henderson against man utd hes going to let in six goals but hes going to get 12 saves yes you heard it here right here this is the best content here for fpl or the best advice and tips to win your mini leagues all your money back dunk joins h dunk are home to naam forest the mighty nutam forest who will not score against the man the myth the legend lewis dunk next to weve got maz rowy whos come in bit of an injury scare last week but its all right hes fine hes fine hes fit and healthy away at crystal palace could get on could get a cheeky assist at steo you never know could outscore friend alexander arnold which i would laugh my head off if he did hes got bournemouth home which is a i didnt realize that then weve got lewis ric leis who has not guaranteed his place in the in the squad at man city but hes lets be honest hes he should be playing hes playing tonight then weve got and then okay weve got and then weve got the midfield five the insane midfield five of saka for arsenal up against city whos going to be on hell be on set pieces hell be in the fck of it hes on penalties isnt he steo odard not in there hes not injured is hes not freaking injured get out of well l diaz he trained today le diaz for liverpool whos hopefully playing more than 60 minutes we got mo salah did you did you not read anna slots comments about the fact that diaz would have gapo would have started ahead of diaz the other day if it wasnt for i cant remember what it was now tired a chance that diaz may not start gpos crap why would you play him over sl he played him last night salah madu again is another assassin cu of the am of players at chelsea have got so i ive got a strong bench to come on anyway to be fair my bench is brilliant saka diaz salah madai and finally rashford as a new addition into that midfield then weve got welbeck yes you heard it right its not 2014 its 2024 danny welbeck is coming back and hes coming back with a vengeance hes my vice captain no hes not then weve got hal harland joining him up front on the bench weve got fabianski whos lets be honest not even worth mentioning then weve got pedro first sub pedro first sub steo pedro first sub do you think its a mistake putting him as first sub do you think i should drop someone else well that games got nil one n either way written all over it so no i think its fine okay grieves for lip switch up against southampton and then weve got face against everton i think i might put faces second sub what you reckon face home well i was contemplating playing greaves but now im going to play what do you think that greaves is better to play of a face lester r us its defensively ler a useless def id rather play greaves youre talking about a team in southampton who cant he got g got a bloody clean sheet didnt he last week last week fortuitously but it doesnt matter he was on he was no he wasnt there no near monus points okay well there we go thats thats that anyway and we can we can finish that so thats my team so there we go what do we move on to now ive just made a insane transfer i dont even know why i did that he who dares wins well like i said if thats not worth a like everybody make sure you are hitting the subscribe button and like button its got to be worth how many people are watching on xj maybe they could come on over and hit the like button and subscribe i dont think i posted it mate no let me find out no i have i have i have all right i have i have all right he who dares win dont dont dont weve got on x weve got 37 people on x 37 people on x watching us hello to all of you awesome people right okay 39 people on theres so many people streaming at the moment then theres no one watching f no there is and theres champions league as well okay exactly exactly in exactly in fact jaay weve got efl cup where brighton are playing tonight so i will check the teams i think brighton are playing wolves i believe it is and then you got tottenham playing tonight as well so im going to deliberately check the see so brighton are already two n up and its b balaba and ad dingra with the goals so not pedro or well beck or pedro playing well and is on the bench no pedro no pedro dear well its all right ive got him on the bench anyway lets lets lets look at your team have you done okay i better open discord up then have you got the the chat up in front of you steo sean says in the chat if anyone was laughing at this content just remember every other fpl content creator said that henderson and kungu and e were must owns do people laugh at i hope people laugh with us jay thats thats what im hoping people do im hoping that people laugh along share the content make sure youre commenting after the stream let us know what you think thats the key let us know what youre thinking i love the fact i love when you when you do the whole sarcastic whats that from youll have to give me the context i dont know like when when you do streams and youre just like you make a comment and then you just make like a real quick like just it tickles me it tickles me its me at a tom from juice that takes the mick out of me for taking the mick out of him for constantly going its mental whenever you do it whenever you do it when im watching you on stream i just laugh im like what its its every londoner jay every londoner is just drives you at the wall its its that and the face you pull its its anyway u so we got for bugan ver bugan in goal kinate alexander arnold lewis buo palmer salah de bruyne cal and watkins its its a very a very stacked team for those that want to know what the bench is rogers duncan greaves in that order so youve got rogers coming on against wolves in the event of a no show from pedro which is well i may replace him with i may put no it will be rogers for his twopointer hes a freak though jay have you seen him play genuinely rogers no hes he is absolutely phenomenal but so what youre saying is i should have got him in instead of rashford no im not saying that but what i am saying is that hes a very frustrating player to own in the sense of he does everything about he does everything but score fpl points he even in the game against whoever watkins was playing the other day who was wat who was aston villa playing the other day i complet everton there was a moment where i jumped out of my bed where rogers put the ball across to watkins but he just put it too far behind him and watkins looked at him like dude put it there and it was one of those moments where youre like rogers aint going to come with anything hes a very forward thinking player i know mark goldbridge is a massive fan of his but certainly in all seriousness the title of the stream is calbert le and captain alex vol is doing it so the ti stream isnt you doing its alex vol it doesnt say anybodys doing its just it just says c l and alex vol is doing he went he captain isac respect man mad respect if hes going to do it fair play theyre up against leicester im expecting one something like that i think going up against because alex vol i believe owns holland and salah i think or just holland i cant remember now hes doing very well this year like well hes like 300k 200k something like that w so hes just hes just gonna go for it well this is what alex volo does isnt it he comes up with these incredible thumbnails he comes up with these incredible ideas regarding his but he admits himself he watches lots and lots of football and looks more deeper into the way teams set up and how certain players perform against certain defenses and hes personally come to the conclusion that cal luen for him is his best captaincy over the various other players hes got i dont know i dont know where he is in the youtube chat league but hes going to be within reason at least in the top 30 but certainly he is gonna be going for it and i will have a look now to see where alex volo is in the youtube chat hes got to be in the top 30 because hes okay hes probably dropped down to about 400000 after the isaac blank which is very unfortunate for you well im 118th in the youtube chat league 118th alex is 79th okay 79th then so hes only 11 points more than us was that it well like i said me and you are only me and you were 28 points of dread fpl and yet hes 400k alex vol is dropped at 15m okay whats his team his team is arolo and goal no that was previous weeks but cono lewis alexander ronald dunk salah as a rogers kudas very interesting pick there harland and isaac up top so if hes gonna go with calv lein it would be in for isaac right im assuming so i think he may have well carded is he injured is it injured we got a knock he got a knock he got a bit of blood vision thats he took off proportion nothing serious nothing serious 40 people tuning in on youtube hit the like button if you join it hello everyone

the actual games shall we i would love it if you just spat that out it would been funny ass youre lucky that i right so lets go to this game week so were going on saturday lunchtime kickoff steo are you excited for this game week do you think this could be a pivotal game week for the early season where people are making crazy decisions like bringing in man united players i have a feeling that this week could be one of those where the ones that failed last week could do quite well this week the players that blanked last week theyve got favorable fixtures the likes of palmer away at west ham for instance the likes of liverpool at home to bournemouth astonvilla at home to walls tottenham at home to brenford away at tottenham crystal palace at home to man united theres some favorable fixtures jaay and i think that im going to be covering the 3m kickoffs so i think united away i think united away at palace is going to be one thats going to shock i dont see where youre getting this from crystal palace this year havent been exactly bad they just arent getting the results that we expect im looking at it here they lost two to brenford two n to crystal palace sorry twonil to west ham they beat norwich 40 in the cup and then its 11 two2 then they beat queens park rangers in the cup 21 just a good feeling mate its just a good feeling i cant say game man united well get well get to it anyway well get the last two results against man united i dont f well get to it but im looking for im looking forward in answer your question i am looking forward to this game we i think it could be quite high scoring okay west ham versus chelsea lunchtime is the simple answer i think i think youre lagging mate personally west h versus chelsea tnt sports at halfast 12 a game where of course lot palmer owners will be looking hopefully to get some fpl points for them for the amount of money theyve invested in him ive got madaki which im hoping will start the game i think he will west ham dont think kudus for aalo but anyone else that may own any west ham players i dont think so i think majority of their eyes and focus will be on chelsea i think that chelsea have got it in them to win this 21 so i think west ham one chelsea two steo do you want to get yourself up to speed and give us your thoughts on this west ham so far this season surprised me genuinely theyve come away with some decent results that last gasp one1 draw versus fulham of course bowen gets the bloody assist which is very frustrating but i think west ham performed okay h they lost 21 to aston villa and thats like the opening day of the season where aston villa pretty much a settled team whereas west ham were a bunch of put togethers crystal palace they lock they beat 2 n they then beat bournemouth in the cup one nil then they lost to man city like they always did they looked terrible against man city 31 and then up against a fulham team who looked very well organized until the 96th minute or whatever it was where they conceded to make it one1 this fixture though its the home team that likes to get the results so weve got a west ham these are all home wins 32 to west ham 1 nil chelsea 21 chelsea west 31 chelsea 5 nil so the history suggesting this to be a west ham victory i think the way chelsea were playing the other day i did expect them to score more goals versus bournemouth and vice versa i think bournemouth should have scored as well i did predict a high scoring game in that but it ended up being one n im gonna go jace with a im gonna go im gonna go two2 im gonna go two2 jace okay two end to end okay aston villa versus wolves is the first of the three oclocks im going to mention i just think people that own ole watkins are going to be happy again well again i think its going to be two nil to ask ason villa this game i think aston villa win comfortably and no response from wolves your thoughts again im not being particularly blown away by aston villa the results have been wins my god they can see 21 2 n 21 32 okay they got a 30 win against young boys last night ole watkins did come off yesterday although unan r has said that he was tactical foot underneath ice not great i still am saying that matson if matson was an option youve got to get him in your team he is a phenomenal talent unfortunately hes just not that option and against woles a team in which its been very low scoring between these two teams a few one ones in there couple of one im just gonna go with a im gonna go 21 jace to aston villa okay fulham versus newcastle is next on the list i dont have any horses in this race i know people do have the likes of smith run is the defender whats his name newcastle defender robinson what who him robin youre thinking of no im on about newcastle defenders no ones got them apart from dan burn if anybody now dan burn thats it thats the guy theyve all sold l hall i think that this is going to be the munis breakthrough that f waai for i think hell score but i think newcastle will score im going to go one0 munis to score start will he munis he was benched the other day i think hell adely that was after international duty but one off at me but well the last the last four fixtures in fact five out of the last six newcastle have one to nil got 20 1 nil 3 n 2 nil 1 nil i agree with you jaay though i think these two teams are going to cancel each other out and i fulham have looked good defensively this year and ive regretted selling robinson im gonna im going to go one1 jay okay then we got leicester versus everton people clambering to get jamie vder in javard in instigated a price rise was it last night the night before making him what 57 now is that right still if its if its a glimpse of what the past jamie vardy has done it could be a steal at 57 against everton a team that are pretty awful in most aspects i think that leester are also awful i think that this is going to be one of these games where its going to be a nil or its going to be a highscoring game i and i dont know which to choose from a game of lots of misses is what im saying or a game where we start to see people just scoring for fun im g to meet it in the middle and im gonna go with a im gonna im g im going to go two all well interestingly enough the last time these two played was on the 1st of may 2023 and it ended 22 wow calit lein scores a penalty your mate face assisted centu james madison assisted jamie vardy and then ai made it 22 in the 55th minute i think this game is going to end up either nil or 11 and im just going to go with one1 jace okay liverpool then face bournemouth at anfield i was up at liverpool today i to drive up to a place called witness just outside liverpool i had to do for work i had to how long does that take to get there where i went to just over two hours not too bad okay it wasnt too bad right i think liverpool are going to win this 31 i think bournemouth is going to score i think its going to be an annoying for a lot of people who own double liverpool or triple liverpool players i think itll be 31 okay well interestingly enough it ended 31 back on the 19th of august 2023 jay wow i havent got theory in front of me who scored the bournemouth goal in the third minute and they play for bournemouth now for gods sake popular a popular fpl asset m i hang on so they play for b now i have no idea very popular asset seeno yes no it wasnt seeno and on that day it was lucky was a lucky guess it was diaz salah and jotter that got the goals for liverpool in a 31 win mallister was sent off that day i youre saying 31 i think liverpool have got enough in the tank to keep a clean sheet here the history against bournemouth is very good we got a for these are all liverpool wins 21 9 n 31 21 and 40 i think liverpool will do a professional job i think its g to be a low score though im going to go twonil jaay okay one second please just give me a second i dont know why but its just doing some weird stuff there for me right okay so next weve got southampton versus ipswitch no theres been a lot of well theres been a lot of glory for the away team southampton winning 52 then we got a 111 nil 1 nil and then the last time these two played was 32 to ipswitch but the last time ipswitch were away at southampton ended 1 nil to i switch i would not be surprised if that was to happen again and what jace im gonna go one one okay ive just seen the man city kit it looks awful it does look awful one okay so weve got spurs versus brenford sonny boy 21 spurs two one spurs well brent like man city they dont mind playing him and they do not mind playing tottenham whatsoever they did lose 32 last time out but before that 22 31 brenford 22 nil tottenham jaas i dont if youre aware of this their form has been bad lot of 11 games or so i heard a lot of supporters ringing up and all talk sport and they were complaining about an ball just being lackluster no plan no clear sounds a bit sounds very similar to what they were saying about man united last season so i just think that i think it needs to click again for them i think they have just gone through a tough time i think they need to get scoring and son needs to be more involved and be more attacking when he drifts on to the right hand side i think he just becomes nonexistent so if hes on if hes on the the wing hes just not been involved d in the action and i think they need to get him in the middle of the pitch so what do i say what was i say the score was going to be 21 another 21 what about you the fact that brenford have lost visa is not good i dont know he comes in i dont know if itll be cavalo who steps up and plays the ambero role and urmo takes over visa spot i dont know but i think that if brenford had visa i think that id be probably tempted to go with a brenford win i do like the 21 to tottenham and despite the fact that history suggesting brenford could get a result i think the loss of visa is going to be a lot more hard than what people think and im gna go i do think brenford score though hopefully on burma comes through with something and im going to go with like you jays 21 to tottenham now we move on to the evening game which is the crystal palace man united game im quite confident in this one i do think united will win this and youre going to be quite surprised but im thinking im going to go with 31 to man utd thats 31 to man utd crystal palace won unit three steve hasnt got a clue why im thinking this but let me just say im just i just feel confident going into this game okay well the last time these two played at a 31 win was a was a friendly jace back on the 19th of july 2022 man united won 31 and i cant get any information up thats a shame i was hoping to get some information up and maybe sc okay well what ill do then about testing time man united no the last time man united beat crystal palace was on the 26th of september so were approaching that date last year 2023 the question for you though jaay of the three goals how many did rash would get one nope last season in the in the efl cup sorry in the out of the three goals he scored out the three goals what did rashford do did he get two no he did absolutely nothing he didnt even play wasnt even on the bench it was garo casmiro casemiro seemed to have the game of his life and martial the newly well i say newly hes just went to a new club today didnt he where was it ak athens i dont have a clue but hes joined a new club today and thats the last time man united beat crystal palace it was a depleted crystal palace team im sorry to say this jaas i do think youll score against man united against crystal palace but i think crystal palace beat you and im going to go with 21 okay well i hope youre wrong then we move on to the sunday games and weve got brighton versus nothingham forest where im gonna have my man pedro on the bench st you go first on this one well looking at the history here theres a lot of threes a lot of threes jaay maybe benching pedro could be could be a way in which you may be like better not bench him we got a three rord we got a three 32 and the last time these played each other ended one nil to brighton theres a lot of threes here jace im expecting this to be quite low scoring the notting of forest defensively i think nuno has done something with notting of forest which he did with wolves which is just make him very difficult to beat and even though nottingham forest create a lot of chances they cant seem to put the ball in the back of the net they did a job on liverpool last week and agree with you col i think that i think this is going to end up being like a one im gonna go one1 one nil one nil bri what do you agree with coleman whats that one nil two right one0 to brighton well coincidentally thats what happened last year there we go hisory repeats who scored the goal though for brighton come on jay mate testing your bright i dont have knowledge of brighton i have no you do youre a massive brighton fan and this player is who le dunk no he was the best performing defender that day if anybody in the chat gets this they can easily a current brighton player now shall i just say its a trick question is it an own goal its well ill give ill give you the who the who scored the own goal it was that wellknown not forest player andrew omo bedelli who right move on right moving on man city versus arsenal in the the in the late afternoon kickoff great game this could a good watch could be a good watch do expect c to win this im going to go manch man city to win this 32 three two are you im going to do a you here are you taking the piss youre joking right 32 jaay the last time man city scored more than two goals against in fact more than well when they scored three or more goals against arsenal was on the 26th of april 2023 since then arsenal have done very well which player were going to get ste an aral shirt this season ch which player scored twice and got an assist for man city that day dan maybe you can share yours with him dont need to wash it who got the two goals and ass say again i wasnt listen what was the question man city beat arsenal 41 that day who got two goals and an assist what year last 202 kevin de bruyne kevin de bruy how do you remember that i just remember him getting two goals and assists against arsenal hen got and i didnt i didnt own him well hanen got a goal and assist im im thinking of going with on the score prediction super brew one nil to man city it was a game we that i got him in after that i think i got him in after that and he blanked and he blanked and he blanked i think three games in a row after that said to ray on the voice message im hoping that kevin de bruyne turns up in this game just to before i bring in sacka and2 could do a lot no im going one nil to man city i think this is going to be a g because arsenal playing thursday theyre playing ths away so i think its gna have a big factor in it i think arsenal are going to defend for their life i think ray is going to do well but i expect man city to win one nil probably howand with the goal as well but the last three games have ended 1 one 1 nil and nil and thats one nil in arsenals favor so he knows what hes doing artetta he knows what hes doing odard could be a b creativity thats the only downside is odard missing for the creativity but i think theyre so defensive well i dont think theyre so defensively solid that i think the move this year is to have rea and gabrielle right steo thank you so much

Welcome joining everybody live for this uh quick live stream with myself and Ray usually Jason would be here but he's got a bit of a sore throat funny that after a bad game week it's funny that isn't it Ray bit of a bit of a coincidence after a terrible game week despite the fact sacka came through with a the nice seven point for him yeah can't turn up with a sore throat doesn't matter though we're here that's the main thing what are the odds yeah yeah I feel like doing an ash I think with Jace now I think that whenever whenever Nick he normally is having a a stinker or something Ash calls him out so Jason I'm calling you out as you can probably tell everybody I'm in my mom's bedroom so yeah I'm in my mom's bedroom I got a mascot over there the teddy bear there's Winnie the Pooh as well Ray and the little dog so hopefully they can bring me more luck for next week's game week five but we are going to be talking about game week 4 uh make sure if you are brand new around here hitting the Subscribe button and make sure you're hitting the like button as well Ray let's just crack on I want to get to the elephant in the room basically and I want to talk to you about my wild card and the fact that I if I have just left my team as it was left as it was i' have got 41 points I wild carded how many points do you think I got unless you've already seen it on the X that I've posted I haven't seen it 44 No 41 but if I'd have played that Legend Calvin Leen I'd be on 45 so yeah I want to get your immediate reaction because obviously over the past two weeks me and you have been discussing my my Wild Card you've been sending me over many haland dress even though you knew I was adamant that I wasn't going to be going with haland you've been proven right R when I eventually showed you my Wild Card tell us the honest proof what did you what did you think when you saw it yeah I thought for a nonh harand draft I thought was quite solid I was quite adamant about maybe having sacka if he didn't have Holland and and just having the most ridiculous Midfield of course carvi lein I mean My ultimate troll do you want to just quickly tell us about your hall of lame Nick and that from Shane wrestling your hall of lame that you have regarding players you've got three yeah sure so over the four years that I was absolutely obsessed with FPL I had a wall of lame specifically for three special chaps so number three was Leo Leandro trossard for Brighton I remember that whenever I'd have him he'd either not start or he' blank you know this is this is prime Potter days as well when Potter would literally make seven or eight changes per game number two is Wilford zaha specifically I remember a couple of years ago I had him for about a seven eight game Run where the fixtures were incredible he plays every single game but I think he got a goal and an assist and funnny enough is despite the fact that he was getting he got those returns I never got a green hour with him and number one the ultimate troll the all of lame the guy who carries the torch is Dominic carv Leen two seasons ago I think I finished 80 88k or something like that and I had Cari Luen for the last six games and I couldn't actually get rid of him because he wasn't a fire because he was still he was still playing he didn't get one return from me St it was absolutely an Abomination and yeah after that I was like I'll never get him again so when you had him in your draft and you're explaining it to me and you're telling me the fixtures I said steo okay but this guy is a prick I hate him with all my well I I I said a lot more things in the voice but I said you can go back to school get in his stupid skirt the prick and uh yeah I never want to see him in any draft ever so a goal hold on hold on hold on so last night I went out for a walk and I was coincidentally voice messaging you I was just responding to some voice messages and you were one of them and you were telling me about your hall of lame again no ni chain wrestling I'm not going to lie and I get back home and I see it's 2-n to Everton quickly scroll on where's my phone I can actually do this now scroll on my phone oh God quickly who got the goals and I just I laughed aloud and then a WhatsApp popped through from you saying DCL with loads of laughing emojis you couldn't make it up Ray could you no and I and I said to you as well that the moment he actually scored I said [ __ ] hell steo I literally said that loud yes yeah talking of talking of differential picks I just I keep forgetting it Alex Volo a shout out to Alex who created the brilliant thumbnail and he he went with the Isaac captain and obviously we know how that went I just want to quickly go through the just see who's joining us live I'll do an Al I know I've seen his name I know Alf is here guys guys I I'll try I'll try a quick impression hi guys this is Mrs Churchill here so do you play FPL okay I'll go next well that that's one subscriber gone cheers Al for your support and everything but I dropped to I've dropped to subscribers from 11 to 10 my love you love you love you this is I'm just going to do an Al FB Al an alout the whole show John Harris Legend to be fair imp but mate I'll do an impression of John Harris John M is he goingo what was that David Hamil Spartan Michaels Michaels threading good Lord he's making an appearance to Matthew zishi I haven't seen this name for a while giraffe wife official Ray must be having a good week as Jane as Jane week says as Jason says as I just said Alf is here good evening really am enjoying Al's content if you don't know his content a bit of a different take on fantasy football content he does a um in competition with us he does a a Saturday night reactions stream where he takes callers and actually to be fair it's actually really enjoyable I really enjoyed last night so I was listening to it on the way down down here to to good old Newton a Newton a and yeah I really enjoyed it and the had um eyes came on and I actually did funny enough Al I actually talk about what as mentioned in the bonus total stea podcast that's coming out on Tuesday Ray I think I mentioned you Ray about about 20 times slagging off women there is a in all seriousness there there's a there's a um there is a serious tone to it when I talk about as and what he says to ALF and regarding po potentially even social media but listen to the total SE the podcast for that Alf is actually saying why did people wild call in Fall well for people like me I had to because my team was an Abomination now ironically if I just left the team as it was I've done the maths and it turns out I would have got exactly the same points but I would have lost 0.1 value on certain players and there were other players in my team that absolute garbage so I essentially had to do it the good news is Ray is that sacka went down by 0.1 so I actually will be able to get an in for 10 million for Kevin De bruyne in game week six the plan still there talking of Al funny enough we'll get on to it in a minute I would argue that I mean I I don't really look at anything on X because I've muted it all to be honest with you but there are a few accounts that I haven't muted regarding FPL that I follow that is an Alf is one of them and he's had a Stormer of a week this week Ray most people as you probably imagine howand doing very well if you've own howand that's all the points you've got but alre not only did he have Rey only did he have sacka yeah Gabrielle yeah great in it thankfully I'm having a nice enough season this year where I'm not getting annoyed by people's scores esk is here Zim's here shager is here heus is here many many more people if you are brand new on like I said make sure you are subscribing and hitting the like button be nice to get to 10 8,000 8,000 subscribers by Christmas come on share share share like hello lisis good evening or if you have Tik Tok and you like if you like if you like stupid piss take videos of this Channel and just taking the mick of FPL you could follow us on Tik Tok at Elite FPL it seems to be getting a lot of traction Ray considering we only did it just a couple of days ago yeah got a lot of views considering but let's let's crack on Ray look we we we we've looked on a wild card team and let's get real here so I discussed at length yesterday during the 3 pm kickoff the reasonings behind my wild card and I think the majority of these players that I B in are the ones that you kind of expected them to be so the veran fleen pairing we knew that was going to be happening the ones that I know for a fact you wouldn't have thought were happening were going to be canate for definite dunk and Kevin De bruer in this game we in this wild card team in your humble opinion what do you actually think of this team overall yeah again from a non- Holland aspect I I do like it it's quite funny because the likes of dun canate I think I was kind of putting them in drafts that I was sending to you with harand so when I saw you actually have these assets I was like okay wow he's really you know he's really going in strong with that pretty much Elite Midfield of Palmer Salah and de bruyne I was very adamant with you to have sacka at the end if you like even though I know I was you know tossing it up thinking oh what what we're going to play but then I was kind of really lent into you know having sacka but on paper I kind of think it really does make sense for the next few game weeks as you rightly said and one of the things that really impresses me is you've got a really good bench like kavic Luen and inmo fantastic assets going forward on paper at least now Xiao Pedro was the one because I I did definitely text you I said I'd go for Welbeck rather than Xiao Pedro but then you said I'm actually pointing one off and then I know I was mocking around a bit with your draft what you could do if you don't if you n at you're not going for Holland but the thing is is I really like the de bruy shout because you still have you know a city attacker and you know of course he won't get the points Harland will but it's most likely we would think that he would be feeding Harland it didn't work out I think having canate is a fantastic shout because I do think he's just nailed as as you know as I kind of said to and a lot of people have been saying and I I sincerely did not think that not and Forest were going to score a goal and by all by all aspects they didn't really create massive massive opportunities but I think going forward you're really well set up to be honest with you SEO one question I did have is did you actually get a green arrow no without without hland it's not impossible I think the hanen captain so I I always use the moderator league as a kind of a give or take idea how well I'm doing because the moderators within our group within reason they are very very good at the game and it's kind of like is it a barometer Ray is that the word I'm looking for here barometer yeah barometer yeah just a general idea of how I'm doing and when the game updates and whatnot I'm going to be to I mean it hasn't actually updated as of yet it went update for at least another hour or so but as it was as of yesterday there's only 19 points between myself and Dread now this is before substitutes and whatnot 19 points between me and Dread and he's a million places ahead of me so if we're looking if we're kind of looking at that kind of barometer I think that if I'm 19 points from 400k it's nothing yeah and I appreciate the fact that I have got no howand he will be coming in a game week seven and this is the key Ray I had to I've already checked that I can do it I needed to bring in players which allowed me to get hanen back for game week seven now the plan will be Watkins to go Salah to go which enables me halan plus I think it's 8.2 I think for a midfielder and we know that the vast array of talent that is available at the 8 million or under bracket so I'm able to do that which means then I've got triple City against it uh they playing Leicester isn't it at home no who's he they playing in who sorry they play Fulham Fulham of course sorry yeah seven seven so they've got Fulham in gameweek seven and I could potentially have three Man City players against Fulham now I'm just going to quickly look at the fixture list around Man City at the time just to kind of give me an idea of the understanding where potential rotation may come into play now I know that Kevin De bruy is going to be on the list of highly likely players to be rotated across the next several fix he ain't going to get rotated against Arsenal he's the number one name on the the the list of players to be starting against against Arsenal he ain't going to be playing against Watford so there's his rest he's then got Newcastle away which I'd like to think he could be a starter then it's saavan Bratislava away well pronounced and then and then it's fullham at home now they've got a f day break a five day break between Bratislava and Fulham the game is at home and then it's the international break where there's there's going to be 50 days between Man City and wolves so I think that by the time we get to gameweek seven if I can still well I should be able to afford howand it then means that I've got howand Kevin De bruyne and probably Lewis playing against Fulham that could be could be potentially huge depending on what happens with the likes of Kevin De bruyne and Lewis and even hen himself moving forward so I'm kind of happy with the fact that I've got this three game week plan in place I will be bringing in sacka for Kevin well actually yeah that's a good point I'll be bringing I was gonna interrupt you yeah yeah I'll be bringing in sacka just realized for Kevin De bruyne however Ray I'll be honest with you watching that Chelsea game last night despite the P that Palmer looked good he was pushed out way too wide to the right it was just not effective at all and that concerns me I don't know if it was a one-off I don't know if it was tactics but I was not impressed by Palmer at all being out on the right hand side do you know much about why he would be put out there at all yeah I think it was to more support defensively because Madu just I don't feel tracks very I don't think he tracks well I start again I don't think he tracks back well actually so I think in the second half I think Palmer was more kind of like the right winger if you like and M was taking more Central areas and then obviously when they bought on it's unbelievable who they can bring on you know Sancho Felix and unu then yeah basically it was almost like a 442 but Palmer was taking the right a bit like yourself it is a little bit of uh it was quite alarming how non involved he was in the second half isn't it everything was coming through the left side either from Sancho or Netto prior to that but you do have some lovely fixtures to continue the assessment isn't it because there's no rush bringing in an Arsenal asset against Man City so you can give Palmer the West Ham game isn't it and then seees what happens however the thing is is that you know with Palmer Salah and de bruy that you have in there is that you've got great price points when you want to bring in sack out I actually don't think it's a question of if and when you do look to do that then obviously decide which asset that you feel is right to take out but one thing I was wondering is there a way of bringing in sacka and harand and if you do that who's kind of like that third asset that really needs to be dropped down to accommodate those two yeah that that is ordering on well no I I know I can have let me just quickly do the maths here while we're doing let's just quickly go for the chat Ray just just go quickly go for the chat and then I'll try and do some maths here yeah yeah no worries whatsoever I know there was a question yeah I kind of go what SK said so you know do we and J starts game week five I think so SK because you know the thing about Darwin is is he's just not a guy who can return whatsoever isn't it gets in great positions um I'll go forward Harry Dawson how bad was the sack injury Harry at the end of every game sacka lims off you know he gets kicked you know skyed down pretty much every single game so it's very normal that he'll just kind of go off gingerly and but the good thing is we just sub him off now you know put the packs on and I'm very confident he'll be playing against um Atlanta but funn enough if he wasn't to start against Atlant Atlanta you know you got players like jayus and Sterling that could come in so you know I think offensively we're looking pretty pretty hot right now um you know FPL Kevy saying hey hey man by the way when do auto Subs happen later tonight yep it would do knowing that from the game uh Ben and black hit that like button for Jason's poly throat yeah he's very raspy guys he really is he's absolutely raspy at the moment hello hello how you doing guys let me sing a song Happy Birthday yeah uh Han I got 20 points this week Henderson face porro Trent seller Captain Palmer Bernardo Baron Diaz I would assume Anana havs and isach wow 20 points is is Harsh we got uh Del pool 60 points this game we triple Captain Harland was has amazing he's been a longstanding fan of the show and he's doing exceptionally well this year like really well he's like 2,000th in the world it's Lous and he was very unfortunately yesterday with the last minute goal from Nottingham Forest because he had double I was going to say man united defense double Liverpool defense but we were just talking just then Ray about maths math so sacka comes in for Kevin De bruyne howand comes in for Watkins that leaves me with 4.8 in the bank if I get rid of Palmer but get rid of Salah gives me 6.8 in the bank if I have the 4.8 midfielder just for argument sake Harry Winks I'd have the Midfield of saaka Salah and bermo and Rogers Rogers the player that looks phenomenal when it comes to Fantasy Football returns is a waste of space if however I get rid of Salah I have then a Midfield four of them bermo Palmer sacka and a 6.8 midfielder who could be someone like e because I think a lot of people are starting to get frustrated by him or someone else that comes out of the woodwork that could be if I just look at the top performing midfielders that's 6.8 or under you got Medi you've got someone like McNeil like a double up on Everton seeno who looked he looked Lively yesterday he got you a yellow card didn't he R I know that did make me chuckle in that world record breaking game so yeah there the key the key is Ray is by the time we get to game week seven I'll be able to get in hland and I and I'll have sacker as well so in game week six I'm most likely as it sits here right now the thought process is to Captain actually no sacker at home to Leicester um we we we'll need to look into a bit more deep Southampton sacka at home to Southampton game week seven no game week six oh sorry yeah game week six that's when I'm gonna be bringing in De bruyne sorry taking out de bruyne for for sacka so because I need that coverage yeah and there's a small possibility as well Ray a very very very small possibility that depending on the circumstances it could be a case of I may may have to bite the bullet and get rid of Trent doing minus four and bringing or do for free bringing a Arsenal Defender but we'll we'll come to that closer to the time but no I think overall Ray moving forward with my with my team I'm pretty happy I'm pretty happy I like you say next week if I bring my team up for next week I'm going with a 343 this will be the week when Cal lean decides oh well I've done really well against Aston Villa despite the fact quite literally being on my own up front with no support whatsoever whereas next week when they're up against I believe it's Wolves I think I can't remember now but they've got they got a decent fixture anyway at this point I'd like to think that hopefully Cal Luen will come through yeah he is away oh yeah he's away at Leicester not the greatest of fixtures but they're not keeping clean sheets I expect that to be a one1 21 either way some nonsense like that but I ain't G to be playing Rogers at home to wolves I've kind of and it's all depending of course on the information we received about Pedro as well and I'm just assuming it's a an international injury Ray so yeah my team for next week will be canate Trent and Lewis and then ummo Palmer Salah Captain the bruyne Calvin Leen Watkins and Pedro potentially becoming Rogers if I find out that he isn't going to be available for the game against n Forest yeah I'm kind of happy with that team salah's going to be the popular pick next week depending on what happens in the the the Champions League cuz I only just found out this Ray today and obviously you'll be aware of this champions league is very very very very different this year in the sense of it's one week it's Champions League the following week it's Europa League then the following week it's champions league and you're on a Thursday evening R yeah so it's because it's eight games in this group stage that really is to table is that games will be happening Tuesday Wednesdays and Thursday so unfortunately for us we're on Thursday and then we're playing Man City away on Sunday so two so back toback away games and but man city are at home on Tuesday in the Champions League and then obviously at home to us on Sunday so you know the Calendar's just Fallen that way you know I'm not one of those conspiracy theorists about fixtures look it is what it is so yeah so because of the fact that all the Champions League teams have got two extra games by default so rather than the six you had before now you got eight to qualify until the last 16 is you know now there will be a little more rotation it will be a bit more R there will be you know Subs around the 60 70 minute Mark once again so that's really stuff to be very very aware of and therefore you know if you look at a player like even though I answered the question earlier about J in game week five is you know with Liverpool I could definitely see apart from Salah a lot of rotation happening in those attacking areas which is something we always expected anyway especially for a player who's not historically reliable fitness-wise so I think they'll look after him a lot personally in regards to jot but so yeah it's going to be really really interesting one actually seeo and I mean another thing in regards to something I want to say as well is look Rogers is five million you know we're just people are just happy that he's a cheap enabling person that plays so I feel like expectations should be curbed a bit I think you know when I was looking on X in regards to Rogers I understand fully that he could have got returns he's basically playing as a striker I think it should be more of I know it sounds Rich coming from me but it should be more of an appreciation that he is playing for a very offensive team and he's only 5 million and he's in your team and he's a player that you could rely on to come in when you need those players if it was someone like IMO I totally understand the frustration he's 7 million there should be an expectation there with him when you look at Players like Rogers when you look at Players like seeno when you look at even players like Pedro you know these guys are like five and a half you know they're they're fantastically priced enablers that are going to be starting games so I make my expectation very different for seeno for example than I would for obviously someone like a Watkins where like I spent a lot of money on you here I have an expectation with someone like seeno Xiao Pedro in this instance Rogers they're just the enablers there to allow you to bring in more premium assets as you've done in your team and I would think that's something I'd advocate in regards to mindset is look I know Rogers didn't return but he's starting for your team at five million so that you could have Salah and Harland for example so yeah I think that's something that needs to be considered in all Fantasy games to be be honest with you st because you know to bore you for a minute with my one you know I've got lots of enabling players I've got Murillo who's one of the cheapest defenders in the game he's got me two clean sheets I'm absolutely delighted but my first thing was okay I've got him in my team really CH enabler so that I can have Trent Palmer Salah Harland sacka you know what I mean so the expectation is very different there so yeah I think that's you know cut yourself some slack as well s I'd say I know I completely understand what you're saying about Rogers but the fact that you have him in your team is going to be definitely in my opinion a positive for you moving forward because he could just stay in your squad pretty much for the foreseeable future just want to say there's a load of people watching right now make sure you are hitting the like button and subscribe button if you enjoy the content myself Jason and Ray bring you will'll be bringing you the game week five preview at some point next week on Wednesday probably and then next week Saturday I'll be doing the 3M kickoffs again for more misery death and any other words of terminologies to describe depression if you're an Arsenal fan though after the Atlanta and man city game we got good news for you you got six home games out of the next eight fixtures sorry next seven fixures you got Bolton oh can't wait for that Ray you'll probably going for that for free won't you yeah I going to take my son to the game oh really oh really yeah oh brilliant that'd be great to see the under 12s perform I'll be like hey in two years you'll be on the pitch mate you be like your cousin won't he just I don't know if you're willing to disclose that information you told me off there yeah yeah absolutely so my cousin is over at the moment because her son actually has trials for Bournemouth at the moment and ipswitch to be a uh goalkeeper so he's only 14 years old he's 6'3 so I don't know what they're feeding him in Australia it's actually pretty insane and yeah he's just finished his two weeks trial at Bournemouth hopefully successful there and he starts tomorrow in IP switch for I think about a week or maybe two weeks as well so it's absolutely I'm really happy for him and the great thing is is he's very kind of he's just like a calm chilled individual anyway so he's just like I'm just going to try my best and see what happens but uh yeah it's it's absolutely amazing the fact that you know if is successful that you know he'll do the whole digs thing live with a family and stuff like that and you know do the academy study and then hopefully get an opportunity so it's ABS it's absolutely brilliant I'm really really proud of it actually yeah he'll be able to meet the legend that is the Burnley Legend in Mich the guy yesterday in fact talking of Mich actually a lot of people scoff at him but from a fantasy football perspective at 4.5 million playing for rips which he've got decent fit is up coming you want a bit of a punt Mich at 4.5 you can't go wrong so yeah going on Arsenal's fixtures Ray as seen as you are the Arsenal Guru so after Atlanta and Man City we know that you're going to be playing a full Squad then you're going to be resting all your players against Bolton then it's leester Harris sanman just a few days later then it's Southampton at home before the international break what kind of potential rotation are we going to be looking at regarding Le and Southampton that are book bookending Paris sjain because we're gonna expect the main stage to be playing for Arsenal the likes of ryer Ben white rice Havard probably yeah they are going to be the main hitters regarding fantasy football option of course CRA as well but is there going to be rotation from artetta possibly for Leicester and Southampton with Paris San gerain in mind yeah I think you you you kind of got it right there there's probably like seven or eight seven core players that probably play those games uh you kind of highlighted them really but you know it's a bit like today is you know trossard Martinelli come off and jayu Sterling come on you know the the standard is pretty much probably light for light very very similar and then in Midfield of course you know party might not look right will put georgino in there next to Rice can absolutely do a job and hav as I've been saying I think in preseason as well the way he's built his body type almost like a MZ in a way is he's not carrying a lot of you know like lean muscle isn't it he's just you know he's got that you know very languid kind of style athletic style as well where I think he can just play game after game after game after game so he says so I think the rotations would be more of you know I could see I think hav will pretty much start in Midfield at the moment every game until other the guard's back that's just how I feel in my head or we could see you know a random weri start against Leicester for example and then have its plays up front but yeah but the the asset you know the players who are at risk in air quotes are not people you look to bring in FPL anyway so I think you know if if if you're thinking of a defensive asset you'll go with all of them apart from the left back because the left back could be zenchenko Timo or Calif Fury eventually you know but celba white Gabrielle and RI will play every single game in my opinion because there's no need to break them yeah eckan rice will absolutely play every single one he he's back for the man city game and you know have it to Second will play every single game but then the others will be a big rotation and again it's game State isn't it sta you know if we're 2-0 up against Leicester after 70 minutes we're going to make five subs or four Subs isn't it so yeah I still think after the man city game I think Arsenal are the team to Target as you rightly said as we've been advocating and therefore I would expect minimum one Defender and attacker for pretty much every single team yeah I think people it's funny cuz when you when you look with hindsight it's all brilliant and everything's great with hindsight and certainly I know Al has been banged legitimately on juice whether it's on juice or his own streams he been banging on about Arsenal Defenders and you think to yourself we're idiots for not really jumping on board Arsenal quick enough we're idiots in the wild card for why we didn't go with Arsenal Defenders they're the best defensive team in the division proven last year and even proven this year okay very lucky against Aston Villa you can't take that away wolves were what a stone throw away from scoring against you Brighton obviously they did score against you you were relatively comfortable by all accounts until rice got sent off for that ridiculous yellow card but whatever we're not here to talk about that I certainly do think that the players exact what you just said as long as you got a minimum of one of sacka slhs but preferably sacka and a Defender you are you are winning at the moment and especially when you're moving forward because the this is the play like you said and this is the thing isn't it with games like this chess Etc snooker is and even dance you can think so far ahead that you can pretty much work out the exact precise moments that well this is when most people are going to be bringing in Arsenal assets well I've already got them in I knew they were going to do all right whereas pratts like me have gone with Liverpool and Kevin De bruyne or whatever I mean talking of wild cards just quickly I don't know if you've even seen Jason's wild card I will just quickly bring it up here so I'd like to hear your thoughts on on Jason's wild card and what you actually think of the players that he brought in because he did go with howand and and Salah he he went with that um double up and he's come out with it you know like I say he he's going to be overtaken Me by one point Ray Jason is going to be one point ahead of me and he got 52 points this week majority of those points coming from hland he went with Henderson in goal dunk Trent Lewis sack Diaz Salah Medi Pedro Welbeck Holland and on the bench there's no point in telling you because they're all just DS well well who came in for Pedro face okay of Lester so he's getting one point Off the Bench from face what do you think of this this this wild card team that Jason's done any any standout names where you're like oh God I know you had a problem with me going D I had a draft with double Brighton attack yeah I did I still echo it I think you know it's it's he's really kind of stacked on specific teams you know I mean the you know triple Brighton and then triple Liverpool of course so however you know he's already got harand and Salah you know in my opinion har and Salah are the players that you just want to pretty much keep you know it's not rocket science what I'm saying I think what is maybe a concern for him is apart from Holland you know he he might have he might have to do a little bit of surgery if he wants to bring in a mid-price striker for example you know we don't know what's going to happen with Diaz going forward of course with possible rotations and I think the Madu could be a real headache for him going forward because like I said said they take off Mada Jackson and Netto and they bring on in kungu um in kungu Sancho and Felix and mudri didn't even get off the bench I mean it's just it's something that could just be a headache for him going forward but look on paper it's still a solid solid team like I was saying to you you know I I don't think you can have a poor wild card at this time I think there's just so many good assets and ultimately you know he's probably got himself a green arrow because of obviously what harand did and you know moving forward I think he still is in a good spot moving forward but I could possibly see him moving to eventually a a 352 maybe dropping a Xiao Pedro to a complete dud and using that million to make a Mada into a you know name your six and a half but someone like someone like E I guess yeah I mean someone like e ultimately but could I quickly look at his bench as well yeah like I said it's it's essentially a dud he's got I think it's fabianski on the yeah fabianski F who's the other player Oh Greaves he's got who's okay the four million Defender and then Franco who doesn't even play for Chris oh my God he's got no one yeah yeah so now when I look at it it's it's kind of deterred my opinion slightly because he's literally got no one on the bench like he's just going to be playing these same assets the whole time but I imagine what He'll Do by game week six stroke seven is he'll start to do a bit of surgery you know I could see a LS Diaz turning I could see a Lis Diaz turning into a Rogers for example and then he might look to bring in Gabrielle does that make sense and then he has double Arsenal as well so I think he'll I think he'll mix it around a bit but I think that bench is very very worrying in my opinion because he's got Mada in there who's not guaranteed to start every week and if that doesn't happen what's going to happen a face or griefs come in and suddenly you know you're looking a lot more Bare Bones when I built you a Harland and Salah draft I think I still built it to the point where you can have probably 14 players that you could play here those 14 those 13 players per se are with faing Greaves and I think when I built one for you those 14 players included a Rogers and a dunk on the bench for example so yeah I think moving forward he's going to run into a couple of potholes but I'm pretty sure he has got some kind of plan moving forward where he will downgrade probably Lis Diaz to bring in a Gabrielle per and strengthen the squad I think in the Liverpool teams I'm stating the obvious in the front three Salah and Diaz salah's 100% guaranteed to start Diaz is up there in the in the 90s yeah I think he's always going to play it's j j is the one where I think if you own jotter you've now got to start being potentially worried because I look at their upcoming fixtures and they are going to be if I can just find Liverpool on the screen which of course I can't because Arsenal aren't going to be playing livero for about I just had them on screen there we are 27th October just to let people know that's when Liverpool are going to be away at Arsenal yeah they got AC Milan away it's Bournemouth at home four days later then it's the League Cup four days later and it's walls away three days later then we're on to Crystal Palace away and then it's the international break where they come back to face Chelsea well they got bolog no they got bologna between the wolves and palis oh bologna sorry I read that wrong sorry yeah so yeah wolves Liverpool Liverpool bologna and then it's Crystal Palace Liverpool and then we got the international break where it's then at home to Chelsea away at IP light Zig then it's away at Arsenal home to Brighton home to B leusen home to Aston Villa Liverpool's set of fixtures after in my opinion the bologna game where We've Got Crystal Palace Chelsea R likid Arsenal Brighton bzen Aston Villa me Ray it's time to get rid I think it's good by Trent maybe still hold of canate because he's only five million certainly I think Trent could be the one Ray after Crystal Palace more specifically after after walls could be the one to say goodbye to right yeah funny enough I'm thinking the same I mean myself and John Harris were just having you know like a mini chat there because he's obviously he's playing Telegraph as well and I'm like saying yeah I mean the next guy to really kind of go is Trent to open up uh more you know cheap Defender and then look to bring in a Watkins for example or something like that so yeah I definitely agree with you as well I mean the one thing as well is that that would considerer with Liverpool is if you look at the breaks between those days so you know they got Milan four days Bournemouth four days West Ham okay I know it's the League Cup you know three days then wolves you know then four days they got four or five days bologna then three days they got Palace you know these are just so many games coming thick and fast for Liverpool and and you know they bring in gakpo and Darwin the other day didn't they against not and Forest as well gakpo and Darwin are going to start games in this next three or four matches aren't they one both both together definitely separate and the only safe one is Salah so I agree with you in their best 11 Diaz is in there but you know if it's a really hardfought game against Milan and they're playing bourma for you know after the Wolves game they got bologna and stuff like that I'd be surprised if Diaz starts every single one of these games apart from the West Ham you know caring Cup game so I do actually concur that Diaz and Trent for Jason for example probably be the players he lets looks to get rid of and would you with Trent I agree because obviously Kar can't cover Trent but he will cover defensive points if en when and he's only five million isn't he I think he's brilliant at 5 million in my opinion because Liverpool even though they conceded okay you know I still think defensively going forward they're going to be better than they were under klopp in your opinion who do you think the best Arsenal Defender is to come in for Trent this is me I like Ben White I know he's 6.55 more than Gabrielle and celba I like Ben White Ray am I going mad no but uh I would go with CBA I in my opinion if he starts every single game Gabrielle is the best Arsenal Defender to have in in in fantasy even better than having Rea yeah I think Gabrielle is like one of the top four Arsenal assets but again you don't Cala Fury is g to eventually get games and when he does will he come in as left back or could he come in at Center back at times keep Timber on the left at the moment artetta will not touch it so I would say no for white and still lean more towards CBA understanding that Gabrielle is the bigger attacking threat because again in the last three seasons he scored the most goals in the Premier League The Defender with the highest amount of goals I think he's got to me like 11 Premier League goals in the last three seasons or something like that steo and I think cba's got maybe four in the last two seasons I want to say but um yeah I'd say go for CBA I want to say G Gabriel so much to you but go for CBA and use that point five elsewhere um very mer F saying I don't normally read these out St was a legend best F content creator by m and his reactions are hilarious I said it on stream yesterday at the end of the day I just do this because we've created a community which enjoy the work that myself and Jason and now with rayon V do we just talk fantasy football how it affects us we talk football as Ray's doing now I like to bring on individuals like Ray Dan etc for their expertise I'm just a bloke that can chat but i' like to get an informative opinion from someone like Ray hence why next week not next week but for game week six preview it'll be back to Bringing on a guest hopefully there'll be no techn but I do appreciate the conversation if you do like the stuff I always keep saying if you do like the stuff we do here please share the stuff on social media make sure you're hitting the like button hitting the Subscribe button all that nonsense because it just allows more people access whether they like it or not it's down to their own opinion DJ saying that Lewis will not play next week against Arsenal Ray do you think that DJ's onto something or do you think he's speaking absolute twaddle uh I saw him starting for you but I wouldn't start i' play dunk from the team personally but I think I don't think he'll start against Arsenal I I think it's going to be walk and AK personally oh sorry walk and gavardo I think they'll be the fullbacks SK I mean you already answered the question but I'm going to ask you live best Arsenal Defender is Ry 5.5 into the defense he a bonus Point magnet as well with a clean sheet so what your thoughts on that Ray yeah he's making a lot of saves at the moment SK you know not something that ateta will be very happy with but let's be honest with you is he's played Aston Villa and Spurs who are part of the probably the top six teams in the Premier League and against Brighton will we down to 10 men after pretty much the whole of the second half so I can understand absolutely where you come from at 0 five cheaper but I'm always against going for goalkeeper that I had in four and a half I I don't feel in a grand scheme it's worth it but hey if you have him winning absolutely yeah I completely agree I just want to quickly go over a few highlighted results I mean obviously we had to we Haven even asked you about the north London Derby we we will come on to that last but a few highlighted results from me from yesterday was certainly Brighton nil IP switch nil I did call the pass game Leicester despite the fact not putting in the super Brew I did say I think he could actually end up being 1-1 obviously ended 22 despite the fact that Leicester were 2N up I believe they were other highlighted results obviously Aston Villa in that extraordinary game end to endend being 3-2 I predicted the bour of Chelsea game to be end to end which it was and I predicted 3-2 to Chelsea but the two games were the other way round and it ended up being Aston Villa winning 3-2 rather than Chelsea uh Chelsea of course last night in a game in which I believe if both teams did score I don't think anybody would have any complaints Sanchez for me was the man of the match not Jaden Sancho I don't know what the hell that was all about but Sanchez has an absolute storm obviously with a penalty save as well yesterday and I thought it was an end to end game I thought I just thought the finishing was pretty poor despite some okay saves there were some very good ones from Sanchez but overall a lot of the shots were at the goalkeepers yeah any stand out results obviously Liverpool losing of course one nil how can I forget that that was well like you said it was pretty much one of I think two shots Nottingham Forest had on Target and they scored with that one one goal as Adrian Duran said on talk sport it was just a master class from Nuno admittedly Liverpool weren't on fire but yeah any standout results from you Ray yesterday that you were like good Lord that's a bit a shocker yeah the Bourn of Chelsea game just from a game aspect I I watched the whole game and I was thoroughly entertained I thought it was an excellent advert for the game apart from the bookings which I think it was a record game and they made it out almost to be like a positive and I'm like I don't want you referees I I don't want to know your name yeah just just blow the whistle make sure no one gets killed but anyway but I thought the actual game itself was brilliant I thoroughly enjoyed it I thought Bournemouth was so unlucky they deserved at least a draw in my opinion but you Al like anything if you can have all these opportuni Evan neelon I gave a lot of credit to the save I thought it was a really good save but still you know penalty put it away but football match itself was just go ahead sorry yeah I I said you know when you watch a penalty Tak you go he's missing this I genuinely said last night he's missing this you could tell he was nervous he was sweating it was going to be potentially his first goal for Bournemouth he clearly told seeno because I saw seeno say I'll have this and clearly words were exchanged where basically Seena wasn't going to take the penalty so this bloke stepped up and I just saw the run up and I just immediately went definitely not miss scoring this now and yeah like you said Sanchez goes and pulls out the sa yeah and I think also like we spoke about it preseason I really thought cver was going to be the designated penalty taker because he did take one during preseason but you know again I mean it just I couldn't believe Bournemouth didn't score a goal it was it was actually kind of crazy but then once again you know Chelsea can bring on this unbelievable AR array of attacking Talent like it's unbelievable the players they bring on like all three of them are just fantastic footballers and like I said mudric didn't even come off the bench steo like it's mad so yeah and and and and this is why Chelsea will always be from a footballing aspect just a threat against against any team anyone that they play they're going to be a threat with that those kind of players that they can bring Off the Bench and to be honest with you you know Mesa is obviously trying to find a system there and they've got you know okay they've they've got seven points out of 12 nothing to go you know nothing to write home about but you know that does include two away wins already so you know I think I think Chelsea could be an interesting team not from an FPL aspect but just from a entertainment aspect is they get clean sheets but my goodness me they are going to get some games like they did against wolves where they're going to get five six goals just from the fact they got so many attacking players of high quality really yeah I am happy owning palmer but that West Ham game is going to tell me a lot along with the Brighton game they're two good teams but I expect again Chelsea be in games that are always going to be entertaining end to end like I said even in the Bournemouth game look if if either team had 1 21 or 31 or 32 there'd be no complaints here we then move on to day where woles I get more frustrated from Super Brew point of view where I predicted that game to end one1 and I saw it was 1:1 I'm think oh good that's all right then it's going to come through and then I see Harvey bloody Barnes uh scores a goal with a Joe willick I believe got the assist anded 2-1 to Newcastle uh Alex follows captain and Isaac is this right he went off with a blooded nose yeah went off in 46 minutes right okay so it came up half time was it a serious injury I'm assuming nothing that major I I was I was traveling steo my way back so yeah I couldn't tell you but it's really interesting because in super Brew I predicted 21 Newcastle so I got an exact score so yeah the moment I think I'm four points off you so I went up 16 places just quickly talking the relegation zone now yeah talking of super Brew funny you mention that because I looked at the the table and all the players that normally do quite well at predictions like myself firo loo quite low down maybe tells people something that maybe the results aren't going the way we'd expect or I'm just just bitter but today Ray I listen the latter yes it definitely is going to be the latter Tottenham nil Arsenal one I had mark goldbridge on listening to the game and admittedly you haven't got the the atmosphere if you listen to it on the radio or even watch on TV but in my case listen to it on the radio if I was to do so driving down here you've got the understanding of where the crowd are what the commentary are actually looking at and describing the action to you all I've got with Mark goldbridge is just occasionally him saying oh sacka is in here or hav HS is looking good or whatever it may be salanki should have done better and from my basic understanding it sounded like to me Tottenham didn't take their chances arsenal were the more professional teams I'd like to say they controlled they controlled the game in a manner which you'd expect Arsenal to do contain Spurs hit on the Counterattack they get a goal from a setpiece I don't know if it was a corner or a free kick you'll have to tell me in a second but as an Arsenal fan obviously you're going to be very happy with the win Ray I think by all accounts Arsenal kind of just edged it deservingly with yeah I'm assuming you watched the game and what did you think yeah so it wasn't a professional job per se like we okay the first 15 minutes were tough simply because we played a double pivot with party and georgino we haven't played a double pivot in a long time like even when party and rice are playing you know party will sit in and rice will kind of be the you know kind of box tobox midfielder but in this it was very much party and georginia just kind of acting in front of the defense and you know tottenham's pure exumer and energy is really it's really impressive it really is impressive but then probably from about 20 minutes to about 30 32 minutes is we were getting opportunities and and and Martinelli had kind of a oneone coming off the left where he could have come in a lot more and you know kind of like that on re finish you know kind of like far corner but it was it's just a manb rift of confidence which is why you know when I predicted the lineup I got one off I really thought Sterling was going to start over Martinelli but Martinelli played but then after that it was becoming a little bit bitty and then and then we started to get a bit more control not necessarily opposition but we were controlling Spurs in the area if that makes sense like you know we didn't allow him to get too far in certain areas and closing out half time I was like okay I think second half we'll we'll get him now but then going into the second half they weren't necessarily having o chances to shoot but they were almost having opportunities to create opportunities and they were really able to penetrate through our Midfield quite easily especially the central areas we kind of sh that up and then yes we started to get on the ball a bit more but we weren't kind of creating as much in air quotes as we were in the first half but then when the corner came we're just absolutely brilliant at set pieces sta we're just so good I mean you know the coach who kind of has been coaching us to do this for a couple of years has got so many different routines but what's the best one whipping in in swinger Gabrielle kind of just pretty much manh handles off I think it was Benta and then headers in and then after that really they didn't create anything if anything we look more dangerous on a counter as you rightly said but we're just so defensively aware of what we need to do and it was so impressive because that was not our first choice Central Midfield and you know we probably had a good three or four first teamers out especially guys that are extremely important which is havit being up front erard being in Midfield and Dean rice is that yeah from a footballing aspect I I don't think this was as Smash and grab as the Villa game as we spoke about but you know we we got the win today and you could see Arsenal getting a win if that makes sense because Spurs are very immature and naive off the ball on the ball is like hel them skeleton make it exciting but you know what they've got two wins and two losses now am I right there so they got draw didn't they against Leicester okay so they've got what's that a a a win two wins in a draw or no whatever it is but ultimately I think it's something like they've only won three out of their last 11 games or something like that so from a footballing aspect POS no an has to kind of yeah because they didn't end the season well and has to kind of sort this out a bit now because I think we spoke about it last season as well I think the novelty will eventually run out if you don't start getting results on the board so you know Tottenham did exactly what we were going to do what I thought they were going to do if we had our lineup as expected I generally feel we would have comfortably run out this game because of our maturity levels because of the fact that we got a lot more now but uh yeah from a from a as an Arsenal fan I'm absolutely delighted that you know we've been away at Villa we've been away at Spurs we've won both games and and we haven't conceded a goal this just you know further kind of puts weight on the fact that you know Arsenal are just genuine title contenders now yeah absolutely and they needed to get that that that win today 100% John Harris with a question if you're a non salar only next salar owner you're a nons salar owner bloody hell who to Captain next week got the fixtures up on the screen there so if you're a nonar owner just looking at here right now potentially potentially Palmer away at West Ham but it's an early kickoff don't want to be doing that hen versus Arsenal even though I do think to be honest with you that you guys should keep him quiet but would I be surprised if he scores no because he's hen at the end of the day he's a world class Striker stating the bloody obvious um other fixtures to note potentially note this down John Harris I know you're a bit worried about e not being on penalties but e against man united possibly maybe even Fernandez against against the opposition Crystal Palace Spurs at home to brenford no you don't want to be going anywhere near that so say it quietly Ray Cal L and away at Leicester or even if you own Jamie vardy Jamie vardy at home to Everton you never know you never know Alex Vol Alex hey say that again Integrity yeah yeah yeah Integrity on the stream um Watkins I love Watkins at home to wolves yes the guy that I would uh advocate yeah yeah even maybe Isaac Alex Vol away at Fulham and just a few more comments before because I know we got a go in my flaming laptop's about to explode it sounds like uh a few comments here saying once the chat loads up which of course it doesn't want to the second one load it so we're just going to leave it there I think Ray uh any other words before we we get out of here Ray yeah I think also you know when it comes to wild card and stuff like that is you know you you've you've you've built it for the foreseeable future just stick to what your plan is you know like for example obviously sto's had a frustrating week but you know at the same time you had an expectation that you might not get that green arrow simply because of what harand could do harand did it but then going forward you have a fantastic team for the next two game weeks so I say to everyone you know just stick to your plan at the moment don't need you don't worry about price Rises don't worry about price Falls you know everyone has a great team going forward they should do um I look at yours specifically steo and you know the only change I'd make is dunk plays instead of Lewis but otherwise fantastic lineup on paper I'd absolutely start in Boomer away to Spurs brenford will have opportunities and you know your first bench Can Be Someone Like Rogers you know what a fantastic first guy to get off the bench isn't it so I just say everyone just relax a bit I know we get excited you know I've been an absolute victim of this the whole time so now I've I just sound like I'm preaching but seriously I have lived it stick to that plan for a few more weeks roll those transfers and then in game week six when it starts to get a bit more interesting in regards to Arsenal suddenly being back on the table then you got a few transfers to actually play with going forward without taking unnecessary hits so yes see that's me man but as always thank you very much and thank you everyone F Levy saying here arguably Spurs played better but they also did nothing much with their possession come on you gunners a bottle job says castle made of sand Andrew Ferguson just clarifying about Isaac saying it wasn't that serious it was just the fact they couldn't stop the blood pouring out his nose yahia is saying that sun could be a good Captain C next week castle made of sand is saying vardy I like for a punt and also heus saying what about a leester midfielder what you mean like mavi Diddy that was keep banging on about during my walking videos you know how did he do yesterday oh yeah Kane with a goal did he get an assist I think last week as well or something maybe that that that why mavi Diddy that I kept banging on about is the one to go for after all uh cheers Ray i' really do appreciate you coming on for this hour I know you got to get out of here I know

well were going to get into it in a minute i just want to quickly just say hello everybody welcome joining everybody live for this quick live stream with myself and ray usually jason would be here but hes got a bit of a sore throat funny that after a bad game week its funny that isnt it ray bit of a bit of a coincidence after a terrible game week despite the fact sacka came through with a the nice seven point for him cant turn up with a sore throat doesnt matter though were here thats the main thing what are the odds i feel like doing an ash i think with jace now i think that whenever nick he normally is having a stinker ash calls him out so jason im calling you out as you can probably tell everybody im in my moms bedroom so im in my moms bedroom i got a mascot over there the teddy bear theres winnie the pooh as well ray and the little dog so hopefully they can bring me more luck for next weeks game week five but we are going to be talking about game week 4 make sure if you are brand new around here hitting the subscribe button and make sure youre hitting the like button as well ray lets just crack on i want to get to the elephant in the room and i want to talk to you about my wild card and the fact that i if i have just left my team as it was left as it was i have got 41 points i wild carded how many points do you think i got unless youve already seen it on the x that ive posted i havent seen it 44 no 41 but if id have played that legend calvin leen id be on 45 so i want to get your immediate reaction because over the past two weeks me and you have been discussing my wild card youve been sending me over many haland dress even though you knew i was adamant that i wasnt going to be going with haland youve been proven right r when i eventually showed you my wild card tell us the honest proof what did you what did you think when you saw it i thought for a nonh harand draft i thought was quite solid i was quite adamant about maybe having sacka if he didnt have holland and just having the most ridiculous midfield of course carvi lein my ultimate troll do you want to just quickly tell us about your hall of lame nick and that from shane wrestling your hall of lame that you have regarding players youve got three sure so over the four years that i was absolutely obsessed with fpl i had a wall of lame specifically for three special chaps so number three was leo leandro trossard for brighton i remember that whenever id have him hed either not start or he blank this is this is prime potter days as well when potter would make seven or eight changes per game number two is wilford zaha specifically i remember a couple of years ago i had him for about a seven eight game run where the fixtures were incredible he plays every single game but i think he got a goal and an assist and funnny enough is despite the fact that he was getting he got those returns i never got a green hour with him and number one the ultimate troll the all of lame the guy who carries the torch is dominic carv leen two seasons ago i think i finished 80 88k like that and i had cari luen for the last six games and i couldnt get rid of him because he wasnt a fire because he was still he was still playing he didnt get one return from me st it was absolutely an abomination and after that i was like ill never get him again so when you had him in your draft and youre explaining it to me and youre telling me the fixtures i said steo okay but this guy is a prick i hate him with all my well i said a lot more things in the voice but i said you can go back to school get in his stupid skirt the prick and i never want to see him in any draft ever so a goal hold on hold on hold on so last night i went out for a walk and i was coincidentally voice messaging you i was just responding to some voice messages and you were one of them and you were telling me about your hall of lame again no ni chain wrestling im not going to lie and i get back home and i see its 2n to everton quickly scroll on wheres my phone i can do this now scroll on my phone god quickly who got the goals and i just i laughed aloud and then a whatsapp popped through from you saying dcl with loads of laughing emojis you couldnt make it up ray could you no and i and i said to you as well that the moment he scored i said hell steo i said that loud yes talking of talking of differential picks i just i keep forgetting it alex volo a shout out to alex who created the brilliant thumbnail and he went with the isaac captain and we know how that went i just want to quickly go through the just see whos joining us live ill do an al i know ive seen his name i know alf is here guys ill try ill try a quick impression hi guys this is mrs churchill here so do you play fpl okay ill go next well thats one subscriber gone cheers al for your support and everything but i dropped to ive dropped to subscribers from 11 to 10 my love you love you love you this is im just going to do an al fb al an alout the whole show john harris legend to be fair imp but mate ill do an impression of john harris john m is he goingo what was that david hamil spartan michaels threading good lord hes making an appearance to matthew zishi i havent seen this name for a while giraffe wife official ray must be having a good week as jane as jane week says as jason says as i just said alf is here good evening am enjoying als content if you dont know his content a bit of a different take on fantasy football content he does a in competition with us he does a saturday night reactions stream where he takes callers and to be fair its enjoyable i enjoyed last night so i was listening to it on the way down here to good old newton a newton a and i enjoyed it and the had eyes came on and i did funny enough al i talk about what as mentioned in the bonus total stea podcast thats coming out on tuesday ray i think i mentioned you ray about 20 times slagging off women there is a in all seriousness theres a theres a there is a serious tone to it when i talk about as and what he says to alf and regarding po potentially even social media but listen to the total se the podcast for that alf is saying why did people wild call in fall well for people like me i had to because my team was an abomination now ironically if i just left the team as it was ive done the maths and it turns out i would have got exactly the same points but i would have lost 01 value on certain players and there were other players in my team that absolute garbage so i essentially had to do it the good news is ray is that sacka went down by 01 so i will be able to get an in for 10m for kevin de bruyne in game week six the plan still there talking of al funny enough well get on to it in a minute i would argue that i dont look at anything on x because ive muted it all to be honest with you but there are a few accounts that i havent muted regarding fpl that i follow that is an alf is one of them and hes had a stormer of a week this week ray most people as you probably imagine howand doing very well if youve own howand thats all the points youve got but alre not only did he have rey only did he have sacka gabrielle

considering we only did it just a couple of days ago got a lot of views considering but lets lets crack on ray look weve looked on a wild card team and lets get real here so i discussed at length yesterday during the 3 pm kickoff the reasonings behind my wild card and i think the majority of these players that i b in are the ones that you expected them to be so the veran fleen pairing we knew that was going to be happening the ones that i know for a fact you wouldnt have thought were happening were going to be canate for definite dunk and kevin de bruer in this game we in this wild card team in your humble opinion what do you think of this team overall again from a non holland aspect i do like its quite funny because the likes of dun canate i think i was putting them in drafts that i was sending to you with harand so when i saw you have these assets i was like okay wow hes hes going in strong with that pretty much elite midfield of palmer salah and de bruyne i was very adamant with you to have sacka at the end if you like even though i know i was tossing it up thinking what were going to play but then i was lent into having sacka but on paper i think it does make sense for the next few game weeks as you rightly said and one of the things that impresses me is youve got a good bench like kavic luen and inmo fantastic assets going forward on paper at least now xiao pedro was the one because i did definitely text you i said id go for welbeck rather than xiao pedro but then you said im pointing one off and then i know i was mocking around a bit with your draft what you could do if you dont if you n at youre not going for holland but the thing is i like the de bruy shout because you still have a city attacker and of course he wont get the points harland will but its most likely we would think that he would be feeding harland it didnt work out i think having canate is a fantastic shout because i do think hes just nailed as as i said to and a lot of people have been saying and i sincerely did not think that not and forest were going to score a goal and by all by all aspects they didnt create massive opportunities but i think going forward youre well set up to be honest with you seo one question i did have is did you get a green arrow no without hland its not impossible i think the hanen captain so i always use the moderator league as a a give or take idea how well im doing because the moderators within our group within reason they are very good at the game and its like is it a barometer ray is that the word im looking for here barometer barometer just a general idea of how im doing and when the game updates and whatnot im going to be to it hasnt updated as of yet it went update for at least another hour or so but as it was as of yesterday theres only 19 points between myself and dread now this is before substitutes and whatnot 19 points between me and dread and hes a million places ahead of me so if were looking if were looking at that barometer i think that if im 19 points from 400k its nothing and i appreciate the fact that i have got no howand he will be coming in a game week seven and this is the key ray i had to ive already checked that i can do it i needed to bring in players which allowed me to get hanen back for game week seven now the plan will be watkins to go salah to go which enables me halan plus i think its 82 i think for a midfielder and we know that the vast array of talent that is available at the 8m or under bracket so im able to do that which means then ive got triple city against it they playing leicester isnt it at home no whos he they playing in who sorry they play fulham of course sorry seven so theyve got fulham in gw seven and i could potentially have three man city players against fulham now im just going to quickly look at the fixture list around man city at the time just to give me an idea of the understanding where potential rotation may come into play now i know that kevin de bruy is going to be on the list of highly likely players to be rotated across the next several fix he aint going to get rotated against arsenal hes the number one name on the list of players to be starting against arsenal he aint going to be playing against watford so theres his rest hes then got newcastle away which id like to think he could be a starter then its saavan bratislava away well pronounced and then and then its fullham at home now theyve got a f day break a five day break between bratislava and fulham the game is at home and then its the international break where theres theres going to be 50 days between man city and wolves so i think that by the time we get to gw seven if i can still well i should be able to afford howand it then means that ive got howand kevin de bruyne and probably lewis playing against fulham that could be could be potentially huge depending on what happens with the likes of kevin de bruyne and lewis and even hen himself moving forward so im happy with the fact that ive got this three game week plan in place i will be bringing in sacka for kevin well thats a good point ill be bringing i was gonna interrupt you ill be bringing in sacka just realized for kevin de bruyne however ray ill be honest with you watching that chelsea game last night despite the p that palmer looked good he was pushed out way too wide to the right it was just not effective at all and that concerns me i dont know if it was a oneoff i dont know if it was tactics but i was not impressed by palmer at all being out on the right hand side do much about why he would be put out there at all i think it was to more support defensively because madu just i dont feel tracks very i dont think he tracks well i start again i dont think he tracks back well so i think in the second half i think palmer was more like the right winger if you like and m was taking more central areas and then when they bought on its unbelievable who they can bring on sancho felix and unu then it was almost like a 442 but palmer was taking the right a bit like yourself it is a little bit of it was quite alarming how non involved he was in the second half isnt it everything was coming through the left side either from sancho or netto prior to that but you do have some lovely fixtures to continue the assessment isnt it because theres no rush bringing in an arsenal asset against man city so you can give palmer the west ham game isnt it and then seees what happens however the thing is that with palmer salah and de bruy that you have in there is that youve got great price points when you want to bring in sack out i dont think its a question of if and when you do look to do that then decide which asset that you feel is right to take out but one thing i was wondering is there a way of bringing in sacka and harand and if you do that whos like that third asset that needs to be dropped down to accommodate those two that is ordering on well no i know i can have let me just quickly do the maths here while were doing lets just quickly go for the chat ray just go quickly go for the chat and then ill try and do some maths here no worries whatsoever i know there was a question i go what sk said so do we and j starts game week five i think so sk because the thing about darwin is hes just not a guy who can return whatsoever isnt it gets in great positions ill go forward harry dawson how bad was the sack injury harry at the end of every game sacka lims off he gets kicked skyed down pretty much every single game so its very normal that hell just go off gingerly and but the good thing is we just sub him off now put the packs on and im very confident hell be playing against atlanta but funn enough if he wasnt to start against atlant atlanta you got players like jayus and sterling that could come in so i think offensively were looking pretty hot right now fpl kevy saying hey man by the way when do auto subs happen later tonight yep it would do knowing that from the game ben and black hit that like button for jasons poly throat hes very raspy guys he is hes absolutely raspy at the moment hello how you doing guys let me sing a song happy birthday han i got 20 points this week henderson face porro trent seller captain palmer bernardo baron diaz i would assume anana havs and isach wow 20 points is harsh we got del pool 60 points this game we triple captain harland was has amazing hes been a longstanding fan of the show and hes doing exceptionally well this year like well hes like 2000th in the world its lous and he was very unfortunately yesterday with the last minute goal from nottingham forest because he had double i was going to say man united defense double liverpool defense but we were just talking just then ray about maths math so sacka comes in for kevin de bruyne howand comes in for watkins that leaves me with 48 in the bank if i get rid of palmer but get rid of salah gives me 68 in the bank if i have the 48 midfielder just for argument sake harry winks id have the midfield of saaka salah and bermo and rogers the player that looks phenomenal when it comes to fantasy football returns is a waste of space if however i get rid of salah i have then a midfield four of them bermo palmer sacka and a 68 midfielder who could be someone like e because i think a lot of people are starting to get frustrated by him or someone else that comes out of the woodwork that could be if i just look at the top performing midfielders thats 68 or under you got medi youve got someone like mcneil like a double up on everton seeno who looked he looked lively yesterday he got you a yellow card didnt he r i know that did make me chuckle in that world record breaking game so there the key the key is ray is by the time we get to game week seven ill be able to get in hland and i and ill have sacker as well so in game week six im most likely as it sits here right now the thought process is to captain no sacker at home to leicester well need to look into a bit more deep southampton sacka at home to southampton game week seven no game week six sorry game week six thats when im gonna be bringing in de bruyne sorry taking out de bruyne for sacka so because i need that coverage and theres a small possibility as well ray a very small possibility that depending on the circumstances it could be a case of i may have to bite the bullet and get rid of trent doing minus four and bringing or do for free bringing a arsenal defender but well well come to that closer to the time but no i think overall ray moving forward with my with my team im pretty happy im pretty happy i like you say next week if i bring my team up for next week im going with a 343 this will be the week when cal lean decides well ive done well against aston villa despite the fact quite being on my own up front with no support whatsoever whereas next week when theyre up against i believe its wolves i think i cant remember now but theyve got they got a decent fixture anyway at this point id like to think that hopefully cal luen will come through he is away hes away at leicester not the greatest of fixtures but theyre not keeping clean sheets i expect that to be a one1 21 either way some nonsense like that but i aint g to be playing rogers at home to wolves ive and its all depending of course on the information we received about pedro as well and im just assuming its a an international injury ray so my team for next week will be canate trent and lewis and then ummo palmer salah captain the bruyne calvin leen watkins and pedro potentially becoming rogers if i find out that he isnt going to be available for the game against n forest im happy with that team salahs going to be the popular pick next week depending on what happens in the champions league cuz i only just found out this ray today and youll be aware of this champions league is very different this year in the sense of its one week its champions league the following week its europa league then the following week its champions league and youre on a thursday evening r so its because its eight games in this group stage that is to table is that games will be happening tuesday wednesdays and thursday so unfortunately for us were on thursday and then were playing man city away on sunday so two so back toback away games and but man city are at home on tuesday in the champions league and then at home to us on sunday so the calendars just fallen that way im not one of those conspiracy theorists about fixtures look it is what it is so so because of the fact that all the champions league teams have got two extra games by default so rather than the six you had before now you got eight to qualify until the last 16 is now there will be a little more rotation it will be a bit more r there will be subs around the 60 70 minute mark once again so thats stuff to be very aware of and therefore if you look at a player like even though i answered the question earlier about j in game week five is with liverpool i could definitely see apart from salah a lot of rotation happening in those attacking areas which is something we always expected anyway especially for a player whos not historically reliable fitnesswise so i think theyll look after him a lot personally in regards to jot but so its going to be interesting one seeo and another thing in regards to something i want to say as well is look rogers is five million were just people are just happy that hes a cheap enabling person that plays so i feel like expectations should be curbed a bit i think when i was looking on x in regards to rogers i understand fully that he could have got returns hes playing as a striker i think it should be more of i know it sounds rich coming from me but it should be more of an appreciation that he is playing for a very offensive team and hes only 5m and hes in your team and hes a player that you could rely on to come in when you need those players if it was someone like imo i totally understand the frustration hes 7m there should be an expectation there with him when you look at players like rogers when you look at players like seeno when you look at even players like pedro these guys are like five and a half theyre theyre fantastically priced enablers that are going to be starting games so i make my expectation very different for seeno for example than i would for someone like a watkins where like i spent a lot of money on you here i have an expectation with someone like seeno xiao pedro in this instance rogers theyre just the enablers there to allow you to bring in more premium assets as youve done in your team and i would think thats something id advocate in regards to mindset is look i know rogers didnt return but hes starting for your team at five million so that you could have salah and harland for example so i think thats something that needs to be considered in all fantasy games to be honest with you st because to bore you for a minute with my one ive got lots of enabling players ive got murillo whos one of the cheapest defenders in the game hes got me two clean sheets im absolutely delighted but my first thing was okay ive got him in my team ch enabler so that i can have trent palmer salah harland sacka what so the expectation is very different there so i think thats cut yourself some slack as well s id say i know i completely understand what youre saying about rogers but the fact that you have him in your team is going to be definitely in my opinion a positive for you moving forward because he could just stay in your squad pretty much for the foreseeable future just want to say theres a load of people watching right now make sure you are hitting the like button and subscribe button if you enjoy the content myself jason and ray bring you willll be bringing you the game week five preview at some point next week on wednesday probably and then next week saturday ill be doing the 3m kickoffs again for more misery death and any other words of terminologies to describe depression if youre an arsenal fan though after the atlanta and man city game we got good news for you got six home games out of the next eight fixtures sorry next seven fixures you got bolton cant wait for that ray youll probably going for that for free wont you i going to take my son to the game brilliant thatd be great to see the under 12s perform ill be like hey in two years youll be on the pitch mate you be like your cousin wont he just i dont know if youre willing to disclose that information you told me off there absolutely so my cousin is over at the moment because her son has trials for bournemouth at the moment and ipswitch to be a goalkeeper so hes only 14 years old hes 63 so i dont know what theyre feeding him in australia its pretty insane and hes just finished his two weeks trial at bournemouth hopefully successful there and he starts tomorrow in ip switch for i think about a week or maybe two weeks as well so its absolutely im happy for him and the great thing is hes very hes just like a calm chilled individual anyway so hes just like im just going to try my best and see what happens but its its absolutely amazing the fact that if is successful that hell do the whole digs thing live with a family and stuff like that and do the academy study and then hopefully get an opportunity so its abs its absolutely brilliant im proud of it hell be able to meet the legend that is the burnley legend in mich the guy yesterday in fact talking of mich a lot of people scoff at him but from a fantasy football perspective at 45m playing for rips which heve got decent fit is up coming you want a bit of a punt mich at 45 you cant go wrong so going on arsenals fixtures ray as seen as you are the arsenal guru so after atlanta and man city we know that youre going to be playing a full squad then youre going to be resting all your players against bolton then its leester harris sanman just a few days later then its southampton at home before the international break what potential rotation are we going to be looking at regarding le and southampton that are book bookending paris sjain because were gonna expect the main stage to be playing for arsenal the likes of ryer ben white rice havard probably they are going to be the main hitters regarding fantasy football option of course cra as well but is there going to be rotation from artetta possibly for leicester and southampton with paris san gerain in mind i think you got it right theres probably like seven or eight seven core players that probably play those games you highlighted them its a bit like today is trossard martinelli come off and jayu sterling come on the standard is pretty much probably light for light very similar and then in midfield of course party might not look right will put georgino in there next to rice can absolutely do a job and hav as ive been saying i think in preseason as well the way hes built his body type almost like a mz in a way is hes not carrying a lot of like lean muscle isnt it hes just hes got that very languid style athletic style as well where i think he can just play game after game after game after game so he says so i think the rotations would be more of i could see i think hav will pretty much start in midfield at the moment every game until other the guards back thats just how i feel in my head or we could see a random weri start against leicester for example and then have its plays up front but but the asset the players who are at risk in air quotes are not people you look to bring in fpl anyway so i think if youre thinking of a defensive asset youll go with all of them apart from the left back because the left back could be zenchenko timo or calif fury eventually but celba white gabrielle and ri will play every single game in my opinion because theres no need to break them eckan rice will absolutely play every single one hes back for the man city game and have it to second will play every single game but then the others will be a big rotation and again its game state isnt it sta if were 20 up against leicester after 70 minutes were going to make five subs or four subs isnt it so i still think after the man city game i think arsenal are the team to target as you rightly said as weve been advocating and therefore i would expect minimum one defender and attacker for pretty much every single team i think people its funny cuz when you when you look with hindsight its all brilliant and everythings great with hindsight and certainly i know al has been banged legitimately on juice whether its on juice or his own streams he been banging on about arsenal defenders and you think to yourself were idiots for not jumping on board arsenal quick enough were idiots in the wild card for why we didnt go with arsenal defenders theyre the best defensive team in the division proven last year and even proven this year okay very lucky against aston villa you cant take that away wolves were what a stone throw away from scoring against you brighton they did score against you were relatively comfortable by all accounts until rice got sent off for that ridiculous yellow card but whatever were not here to talk about that i certainly do think that the players exact what you just said as long as you got a minimum of one of sacka slhs but preferably sacka and a defender you are you are winning at the moment and especially when youre moving forward because the this is the play like you said and this is the thing isnt it with games like this chess etc snooker is and even dance you can think so far ahead that you can pretty much work out the exact precise moments that well this is when most people are going to be bringing in arsenal assets well ive already got them in i knew they were going to do all right whereas pratts like me have gone with liverpool and kevin de bruyne or whatever talking of wild cards just quickly i dont know if youve even seen jasons wild card i will just quickly bring it up here so id like to hear your thoughts on jasons wild card and what you think of the players that he brought in because he did go with howand and salah he went with that double up and hes come out with it like i say hes going to be overtaken me by one point ray jason is going to be one point ahead of me and he got 52 points this week majority of those points coming from hland he went with henderson in goal dunk trent lewis sack diaz salah medi pedro welbeck holland and on the bench theres no point in telling you because theyre all just ds well who came in for pedro face okay of lester so hes getting one point off the bench from face what do you think of this wild card team that jasons done any standout names where youre like god i know you had a problem with me going d i had a draft with double brighton attack i did i still echo it i think its its hes stacked on specific teams the triple brighton and then triple liverpool of course so however hes already got harand and salah in my opinion har and salah are the players that you just want to pretty much keep its not rocket science what im saying i think what is maybe a concern for him is apart from holland he might have he might have to do a little bit of surgery if he wants to bring in a midprice striker for example we dont know whats going to happen with diaz going forward of course with possible rotations and i think the madu could be a real headache for him going forward because like i said they take off mada jackson and netto and they bring on in kungu in kungu sancho and felix and mudri didnt even get off the bench its just its something that could just be a headache for him going forward but look on paper its still a solid team like i was saying to you i dont think you can have a poor wild card at this time i think theres just so many good assets and ultimately hes probably got himself a green arrow because of what harand did and moving forward i think he still is in a good spot moving forward but i could possibly see him moving to eventually a 352 maybe dropping a xiao pedro to a complete dud and using that million to make a mada into a name your six and a half but someone like someone like e someone like e ultimately but could i quickly look at his bench as well like i said its its essentially a dud hes got i think its fabianski on the fabianski f whos the other player greaves hes got whos okay the four million defender and then franco who doesnt even play for chris my god hes got no one so now when i look at its its deterred my opinion slightly because hes got no one on the bench like hes just going to be playing these same assets the whole time but i imagine what hell do by game week six stroke seven is hell start to do a bit of surgery i could see a ls diaz turning i could see a lis diaz turning into a rogers for example and then he might look to bring in gabrielle does that make sense and then he has double arsenal as well so i think hell i think hell mix it around a bit but i think that bench is very worrying in my opinion because hes got mada in there whos not guaranteed to start every week and if that doesnt happen whats going to happen a face or griefs come in and suddenly youre looking a lot more bare bones when i built you a harland and salah draft i think i still built it to the point where you can have probably 14 players that you could play here those 14 those 13 players per se are with faing greaves and i think when i built one for you those 14 players included a rogers and a dunk on the bench for example so i think moving forward hes going to run into a couple of potholes but im pretty sure he has got some plan moving forward where he will downgrade probably lis diaz to bring in a gabrielle per and strengthen the squad i think in the liverpool teams im stating the obvious in the front three salah and diaz salahs 100 guaranteed to start diaz is up there in the in the 90s i think hes always going to play its j is the one where i think if you own jotter youve now got to start being potentially worried because i look at their upcoming fixtures and they are going to be if i can just find liverpool on the screen which of course i cant because arsenal arent going to be playing livero for about i just had them on screen there we are 27th october just to let people know thats when liverpool are going to be away at arsenal they got ac milan away its bournemouth at home four days later then its the league cup four days later and its walls away three days later then were on to crystal palace away and then its the international break where they come back to face chelsea well they got bolog no they got bologna between the wolves and palis bologna sorry i read that wrong sorry so wolves liverpool bologna and then its crystal palace liverpool and then we got the international break where its then at home to chelsea away at ip light zig then its away at arsenal home to brighton home to b leusen home to aston villa liverpools set of fixtures after in my opinion the bologna game where weve got crystal palace chelsea r likid arsenal brighton bzen aston villa me ray its time to get rid i think its good by trent maybe still hold of canate because hes only five million certainly i think trent could be the one ray after crystal palace more specifically after walls could be the one to say goodbye to right funny enough im thinking the same myself and john harris were just having like a mini chat there because hes hes playing telegraph as well and im like saying the next guy to go is trent to open up more cheap defender and then look to bring in a watkins for example like that so i definitely agree with you as well the one thing as well is that would considerer with liverpool is if you look at the breaks between those days so they got milan four days bournemouth four days west ham okay i know its the league cup three days then wolves then four days they got four or five days bologna then three days they got palace these are just so many games coming thick and fast for liverpool and they bring in gakpo and darwin the other day didnt they against not and forest as well gakpo and darwin are going to start games in this next three or four matches arent they one both together definitely separate and the only safe one is salah so i agree with you in their best 11 diaz is in there if its a hardfought game against milan and theyre playing bourma for after the wolves game they got bologna and stuff like that id be surprised if diaz starts every single one of these games apart from the west ham caring cup game so i do concur that diaz and trent for jason for example probably be the players he lets looks to get rid of and would you with trent i agree because kar cant cover trent but he will cover defensive points if en when and hes only five million isnt he i think hes brilliant at 5m in my opinion because liverpool even though they conceded okay i still think defensively going forward theyre going to be better than they were under klopp in your opinion who do you think the best arsenal defender is to come in for trent this is me i like ben white i know hes 655 more than gabrielle and celba i like ben white ray am i going mad no but i would go with cba i in my opinion if he starts every single game gabrielle is the best arsenal defender to have in fantasy even better than having rea i think gabrielle is like one of the top four arsenal assets but again you dont cala fury is g to eventually get games and when he does will he come in as left back or could he come in at center back at times keep timber on the left at the moment artetta will not touch it so i would say no for white and still lean more towards cba understanding that gabrielle is the bigger attacking threat because again in the last three seasons he scored the most goals in the premier league the defender with the highest amount of goals i think hes got to me like 11 premier league goals in the last three seasons like that steo and i think cbas got maybe four in the last two seasons i want to say but id say go for cba i want to say g gabriel so much to you but go for cba and use that point five elsewhere very mer f saying i dont normally read these out st was a legend best f content creator by m and his reactions are hilarious i said it on stream yesterday at the end of the day i just do this because weve created a community which enjoy the work that myself and jason and now with rayon v do we just talk fantasy football how it affects us we talk football as rays doing now i like to bring on individuals like ray dan etc for their expertise im just a bloke that can chat but i like to get an informative opinion from someone like ray hence why next week not next week but for game week six preview itll be back to bringing on a guest hopefully therell be no techn but i do appreciate the conversation if you do like the stuff i always keep saying if you do like the stuff we do here please share the stuff on social media make sure youre hitting the like button hitting the subscribe button all that nonsense because it just allows more people access whether they like it or not its down to their own opinion dj saying that lewis will not play next week against arsenal ray do you think that djs onto something or do you think hes speaking absolute twaddle i saw him starting for you but i wouldnt start i play dunk from the team personally but i think i dont think hell start against arsenal i think its going to be walk and ak personally sorry walk and gavardo i think theyll be the fullbacks sk you already answered the question but im going to ask you live best arsenal defender is ry 55 into the defense he a bonus point magnet as well with a clean sheet so what your thoughts on that ray hes making a lot of saves at the moment sk not something that ateta will be very happy with but lets be honest with you is hes played aston villa and spurs who are part of the probably the top six teams in the premier league and against brighton will we down to 10 men after pretty much the whole of the second half so i can understand absolutely where you come from at 0 five cheaper but im always against going for goalkeeper that i had in four and a half i dont feel in a grand scheme its worth it but hey if you have him winning absolutely i completely agree i just want to quickly go over a few highlighted results we had to we haven even asked you about the north london derby we will come on to that last but a few highlighted results from me from yesterday was certainly brighton nil ip switch nil i did call the pass game leicester despite the fact not putting in the super brew i did say i think he could end up being 11 ended 22 despite the fact that leicester were 2n up i believe they were other highlighted results aston villa in that extraordinary game end to endend being 32 i predicted the bour of chelsea game to be end to end which it was and i predicted 32 to chelsea but the two games were the other way round and it ended up being aston villa winning 32 rather than chelsea chelsea of course last night in a game in which i believe if both teams did score i dont think anybody would have any complaints sanchez for me was the man of the match not jaden sancho i dont know what the hell that was all about but sanchez has an absolute storm with a penalty save as well yesterday and i thought it was an end to end game i thought i just thought the finishing was pretty poor despite some okay saves there were some very good ones from sanchez but overall a lot of the shots were at the goalkeepers any stand out results liverpool losing of course one nil how can i forget that was well like you said it was pretty much one of i think two shots nottingham forest had on target and they scored with that one goal as adrian duran said on talk sport it was just a master class from nuno admittedly liverpool werent on fire but any standout results from you ray yesterday that you were like good lord thats a bit a shocker the bourn of chelsea game just from a game aspect i watched the whole game and i was thoroughly entertained i thought it was an excellent advert for the game apart from the bookings which i think it was a record game and they made it out almost to be like a positive and im like i dont want you referees i dont want to know your name just blow the whistle make sure no one gets killed but anyway but i thought the actual game itself was brilliant i thoroughly enjoyed it i thought bournemouth was so unlucky they deserved at least a draw in my opinion but you al like anything if you can have all these opportuni evan neelon i gave a lot of credit to the save i thought it was a good save but still penalty put it away but football match itself was just go ahead sorry i said when you watch a penalty tak you go hes missing this i genuinely said last night hes missing this you could tell he was nervous he was sweating it was going to be potentially his first goal for bournemouth he clearly told seeno because i saw seeno say ill have this and clearly words were exchanged where seena wasnt going to take the penalty so this bloke stepped up and i just saw the run up and i just immediately went definitely not miss scoring this now and like you said sanchez goes and pulls out the sa and i think also like we spoke about it preseason i thought cver was going to be the designated penalty taker because he did take one during preseason again it just i couldnt believe bournemouth didnt score a goal it was it was crazy but then once again chelsea can bring on this unbelievable ar array of attacking talent like its unbelievable the players they bring on like all three of them are just fantastic footballers and like i said mudric didnt even come off the bench steo like its mad so and this is why chelsea will always be from a footballing aspect just a threat against any team anyone that they play theyre going to be a threat with that those players that they can bring off the bench and to be honest with you mesa is trying to find a system there and theyve got okay theyve theyve got seven points out of 12 nothing to go nothing to write home about that does include two away wins already so i think i think chelsea could be an interesting team not from an fpl aspect but just from a entertainment aspect is they get clean sheets but my goodness me they are going to get some games like they did against wolves where theyre going to get five six goals just from the fact they got so many attacking players of high quality i am happy owning palmer but that west ham game is going to tell me a lot along with the brighton game theyre two good teams but i expect again chelsea be in games that are always going to be entertaining end to end like i said even in the bournemouth game look if either team had 1 21 or 31 or 32 thered be no complaints here we then move on to day where woles i get more frustrated from super brew point of view where i predicted that game to end one1 and i saw it was 11 im think good thats all right then its going to come through and then i see harvey bloody barnes scores a goal with a joe willick i believe got the assist anded 21 to newcastle alex follows captain and isaac is this right he went off with a blooded nose went off in 46 minutes right okay so it came up half time was it a serious injury im assuming nothing that major i was i was traveling steo my way back so i couldnt tell you but its interesting because in super brew i predicted 21 newcastle so i got an exact score so the moment i think im four points off you so i went up 16 places just quickly talking the relegation zone now talking of super brew funny you mention that because i looked at the table and all the players that normally do quite well at predictions like myself firo loo quite low down maybe tells people something that maybe the results arent going the way wed expect or im just bitter but today ray i listen the latter yes it definitely is going to be the latter tottenham nil arsenal one i had mark goldbridge on listening to the game and admittedly you havent got the atmosphere if you listen to it on the radio or even watch on tv but in my case listen to it on the radio if i was to do so driving down here youve got the understanding of where the crowd are what the commentary are looking at and describing the action to you all ive got with mark goldbridge is just occasionally him saying sacka is in here or hav hs is looking good or whatever it may be salanki should have done better and from my basic understanding it sounded like to me tottenham didnt take their chances arsenal were the more professional teams id like to say they controlled they controlled the game in a manner which youd expect arsenal to do contain spurs hit on the counterattack they get a goal from a setpiece i dont know if it was a corner or a free kick youll have to tell me in a second but as an arsenal fan youre going to be very happy with the win ray i think by all accounts arsenal just edged it deservingly with im assuming you watched the game and what did you think so it wasnt a professional job per se like we okay the first 15 minutes were tough simply because we played a double pivot with party and georgino we havent played a double pivot in a long time like even when party and rice are playing party will sit in and rice will be the box tobox midfielder but in this it was party and georginia just acting in front of the defense and tottenhams pure exumer and energy is its impressive it is impressive but then probably from about 20 minutes to about 30 32 minutes is we were getting opportunities and martinelli had a oneone coming off the left where he could have come in a lot more and like that on re finish like far corner but it was its just a manb rift of confidence which is why when i predicted the lineup i got one off i thought sterling was going to start over martinelli but martinelli played but then after that it was becoming a little bit bitty and then and then we started to get a bit more control not necessarily opposition but we were controlling spurs in the area if that makes sense like we didnt allow him to get too far in certain areas and closing out half time i was like okay i think second half well well get him now but then going into the second half they werent necessarily having o chances to shoot but they were almost having opportunities to create opportunities and they were able to penetrate through our midfield quite easily especially the central areas we sh that up and then yes we started to get on the ball a bit more but we werent creating as much in air quotes as we were in the first half but then when the corner came were just absolutely brilliant at set pieces sta were just so good the coach who has been coaching us to do this for a couple of years has got so many different routines but whats the best one whipping in swinger gabrielle just pretty much manh handles off i think it was benta and then headers in and then after that they didnt create anything if anything we look more dangerous on a counter as you rightly said but were just so defensively aware of what we need to do and it was so impressive because that was not our first choice central midfield and we probably had a good three or four first teamers out especially guys that are extremely important which is havit being up front erard being in midfield and dean rice is that from a footballing aspect i dont think this was as smash and grab as the villa game as we spoke about we got the win today and you could see arsenal getting a win if that makes sense because spurs are very immature and naive off the ball on the ball is like hel them skeleton make it exciting what theyve got two wins and two losses now am i right there so they got draw didnt they against leicester okay so theyve got whats that a win two wins in a draw or no whatever it is but ultimately i think its something like theyve only won three out of their last 11 games like that so from a footballing aspect pos no an has to because they didnt end the season well and has to sort this out a bit now because i think we spoke about it last season as well i think the novelty will eventually run out if you dont start getting results on the board so tottenham did exactly what we were going to do what i thought they were going to do if we had our lineup as expected i generally feel we would have comfortably run out this game because of our maturity levels because of the fact that we got a lot more now but from a from a as an arsenal fan im absolutely delighted that weve been away at villa weve been away at spurs weve won both games and we havent conceded a goal this just further puts weight on the fact that arsenal are just genuine title contenders now absolutely and they needed to get that win today 100 john harris with a question if youre a non salar only next salar owner youre a nons salar owner bloody hell who to captain next week got the fixtures up on the screen there so if youre a nonar owner just looking at here right now potentially palmer away at west ham but its an early kickoff dont want to be doing that hen versus arsenal even though i do think to be honest with you that you guys should keep him quiet but would i be surprised if he scores no because hes hen at the end of the day hes a world class striker stating the bloody obvious other fixtures to note potentially note this down john harris i know youre a bit worried about e not being on penalties but e against man united possibly maybe even fernandez against the opposition crystal palace spurs at home to brenford no you dont want to be going anywhere near that so say it quietly ray cal l and away at leicester or even if you own jamie vardy jamie vardy at home to everton you never know you never know alex vol alex hey say that again integrity integrity on the stream watkins i love watkins at home to wolves yes the guy that i would advocate even maybe isaac alex vol away at fulham and just a few more comments before because i know we got a go in my flaming laptops about to explode it sounds like a few comments here saying once the chat loads up which of course it doesnt want to the second one load it so were just going to leave it there i think ray any other words before we get out of here ray i think also when it comes to wild card and stuff like that is youve youve youve built it for the foreseeable future just stick to what your plan is like for example stos had a frustrating week at the same time you had an expectation that you might not get that green arrow simply because of what harand could do harand did it but then going forward you have a fantastic team for the next two game weeks so i say to everyone just stick to your plan at the moment dont need you dont worry about price rises dont worry about price falls everyone has a great team going forward they should do i look at yours specifically steo and the only change id make is dunk plays instead of lewis but otherwise fantastic lineup on paper id absolutely start in boomer away to spurs brenford will have opportunities and your first bench can be someone like rogers what a fantastic first guy to get off the bench isnt it so i just say everyone just relax a bit i know we get excited ive been an absolute victim of this the whole time so now ive i just sound like im preaching but seriously i have lived it stick to that plan for a few more weeks roll those transfers and then in game week six when it starts to get a bit more interesting in regards to arsenal suddenly being back on the table then you got a few transfers to play with going forward without taking unnecessary hits so yes see thats me man but as always thank you and thank you everyone f levy saying here arguably spurs played better but they also did nothing much with their possession come on you gunners a bottle job says castle made of sand andrew ferguson just clarifying about isaac saying it wasnt that serious it was just the fact they couldnt stop the blood pouring out his nose yahia is saying that sun could be a good captain c next week castle made of sand is saying vardy i like for a punt and also heus saying what about a leester midfielder what you mean like mavi diddy that was keep banging on about during my walking videos how did he do yesterday kane with a goal did he get an assist i think last week as well maybe that why mavi diddy that i kept banging on about is the one to go for after all cheers ray i do appreciate

4,fantasyfootballfixYT,6R7QSFO75Pg,🤖 AI FPL BEST TEAM REVEAL &amp; Top Captain Picks | Fantasy Premier League 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 5 Guide,2024-09-20T09:04:07Z,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix YouTube channel happy Friday or happy Saturday depending on when you're watching this and welcome to another episode of Eddie versus the algorithm the series here on the fantasy football fix Channel where I'm taking on the computer generated algorithm team for each game week of the 2425 season putting it up against my own drafted free hit team for the week and we're seeing who can come out on top over the course of 38 game weeks and so far the algorithm has drawn level is now 22 after four game weeks to be honest pretty much a stinker from both sides last time out as was the case for a lot of FBI managers unfortunately harand captain on both teams so kind of neutralized out it was a onepoint victory for the algorithm in the end so a very tight Victory but a victory nonetheless for the computer predicted points scoring team let's see if it can do the same again and get one over me as we move into having a look at both of the teams for game week five [Music] so updated score at the bottom of your screen as you can see that is now 22 the algorithm is predicted 62 points for this game week and to try and a achieve or outscore uh that prediction it has put together this side in goal is going to be going with the blugan of Brighton who I think it's a pretty good defensive option at the moment that not many people are talking about in regards to the 4.5 million goalkeeper category personally there are other options that I prefer and maybe even for this game we alone I think Forest have looked pretty good as a side maybe more so defensively than going forward but I still think that there could be you know goals in this game for Forest uh there are other keeper options at that 4.5 mil bracket that I maybe refer long term you've got your Robert Sanchez at Chelsea you've got fleen at brenford you've got other options there too so ban is one that you could go for if you're looking for a keeper option on a gameweek six wild card and one that seems to be kind of nailing down his spot a little bit more this season there's kind of always been that linger threat of Jason steel and that's been the reason to stay clear of Brighton Keepers over the last year or so in FPL but if he emerges as the first choice and holds his place out in the Premier League then a Brighton keeper option I can see you going for worse and as much as I think there could be goals in this one for Forest it wouldn't overly shock me if that one came out being a nil nil or maybe just a one nil narrow win for Brighton as they look to bounce back so yeah into defense then and let's see what the back three is looking like we've got Luca de in there alongside the two Liverpool fullbacks of Trent and Robo so yeah LCA de a player who is getting a lot of attention and as one who's been noted down as myself in the past as a historic FPL troll that I will never go near again however it is difficult to ignore him when he's seeming to start every game even with some assigning Matson coming in and being subbed Off the Bench around the you know 70 minute Mark most games he is still as said getting some very very nice expected assist data coming off maybe even you know sometimes he'll be banking a clean sheet where Villa go on to then maybe concede late and so there is an appeal there with the Champions League starting that was where I thought it might get interesting for the left hand side of that Villa defense will Matson start in the Champions League but we saw Luca Dean start and play you know almost all of the game uh in the Champions League so could maybe Matson be in line for his first start of the Season at the weekend I suppose we don't know there'll be better Villa sources to go from uh than myself but it'll just be PR ition for now Luca deine isn't nailed that is the key kind of highlighting thing to take away but if he is going to beain first choice for the star of the season and start every game and make the 60-minute mark then it is hard to ignore him and Villa has some great fixtures coming up where I'm sure he'll be in the competition to get more assists so as much as I want to ignore him and say he's a trash option Don't Go Near him he'll troll you uh he might not and he might be good he's just set up in that position where he could easily troll you again so I'm steering clear for now I should say uh the two other Liverpool fullbacks I think are great options to go for Bournemouth could have something in this game easily but Liverpool do still have a few nice fixtures coming up there's a bit of a swing where I think people are looking to offload salaf for saaka and all that kind when we've got the fixture swing in a few game weeks for Arsenal game week six I should say is really when that fixture swing occurs but Trenton Robo have still looked decent not eyering attacking numbers truth be told and they are kind of both at risk minutes wise this season season a little bit more with Conor Bradley Simas maybe coming on a bit later but I think that Trent and Robo are still very dependable options for now not going to be in as many teams you'll see from next game we onwards when people scuffle to try and get the likes of Gabrielle in but Bournemouth at home could be a nice fixture for them Bournemouth have impressed me attacking wise so I can't say I'm that confident of a clean sheet in this one but you imagine that Trent and Robo with how attacking they have been uh should be in line for an attacking return or two soon so even if they don't keep a clean sheet in that one maybe they'll come away with something up the other end of the pitch into Midfield then and it's no surprise that mosalah is taking the captain zamb band for the algorithm team this week I could have predicted that a mile off and some big big funds being spent in this Midfield with humon and Co Palmer in alongside Salah as the kind of three premiums in here we've then got e and then Morgan Rogers rounding off the Midfield so interesting to see Rogers in there a player who's you know yet to get an attack in return really well he got was it one assist Maybe uh this season so far I can't even remember there's been so many big chances so many big chances created with him it's hard to remember one that has actually resulted in a goal and not him missing or whoever he passed the ball to missing uh but you have to say that he is getting in good areas he's playing a lot of minutes he seems nailed on in that Aston Villa side and for what is it 5.15 million you can't really go wrong with a villa asset at that cheap price to try and maybe just cover oy Watkins even it seems like such tremendous value and I think he will come good with regards to all his XG and XA that he's been wasting or other players have been wasting I think it just can't continue and hopefully he'll get one attack in return soon that'll be a big boost for confidence uh and then Villa will start to finally find their form kind of like we saw last game where they actually started to put the ball uh in the back of the net sa against Manchester United is an interesting one not one of the weakest defenses in the league right now by any strength of the imagination I think that you've got aarte coming in now who I imagine will start this one away at Palace at the weekend after being used in midweek in the cup and I think that that's going to be a big boost lick has looked good since coming in as well I think he's been a great addition to that Manchester United backline whether or not they're able to go to somewhere like Palace which hasn't always been the easiest of trips for United in the past and get something there with a clean sheet will be a different question and I think that Palace are still you know looking okay going forward and when they are doing stuff going forward as and meta you have the are the ones that you want to Target in attack there's a big thing with a now that you'll probably see other people mention but with the penalty situation him and meta are almost now joint takers who are going to decide on the pitch based on player confidence kind of like a sacka odard situation that we have at Arsenal and so that limits his appeal uh very slightly due to the fact that you know he's not always going to be on penalties and when you're looking at a team like Palace who maybe don't score quite as many goals penalties can be a bigger Factor than maybe at some of the biggest top six s per se and then we've got Palmer son and Salah so a lot of fun spent here but I guess why not if the algor had budget spent over these are some of the best FPL Assets in the game son hasn't really impressed me lately but brenford at home is a very good fixture and I think Spurs could do pretty well in that one with salanki back I also like him as a onewe punt as well uh We've then got Palmer at the 10 million Mark I think nailed on Chelsea you know attacking option hasn't looked quite as good as last season in my view but you know saying that he could easily cut mountain and bag another four attacking returns in one game now uh West Ham have looked all right at home defensively in my view but I still think I back Chelsea in that one to grab at least one or two goals and then Salah doesn't really need much discussion uh didn't look great last time out of course but I think Liverpool rarely look poor two games on the Trot and I think in a Bournemouth home home game when you've got Harland and sacka facing off against each other he's going to be the standout captaincy pick and then up front for the we've got OE Watkins lining up alongside Jamie vardy and Jamie vardy is an interesting one I think that he's one that I've seen a lot of talk around this week whether or not he's a good option to bring into your team and this is kind of the thing where I would head over to the op the stats tool on fantasy football fix hopefully you guys can see this but I've ordered this by FPL points per 90 so how well these players are performing per 90 you can see vardy two rows up from the bottom he's played 330 minutes so far this season so actually a pretty significant number compared to some of the other numbers you see here you've got Watkins only two 72 so far you've got jaia Pedro 262 some of these players have just missed one game but 330 for vard isn't insignificant despite the notion that he'll be he'll be labeled with you know old uh not playing that many minutes he is still getting a decent number at least to start the season off in terms of points per 90 he's on 5.18 but he is in theory outscoring his expected data with his expected FPL points just to the left at that number 4.20 so when you actually order bu this expected FPL point he's not inside the top what is it 11 or 12 you have here he's even below Alexander isach he's on the second page alongside the likes of munice who have stunk the Gaff up so far so the data's not really there to suggest vard he's not you know even reaching the levels of XG of Antonio or munice and when you've got someone like a calvat luin here who could equally offer an option at 5.9 million so only two2 million more I think that he might be the better pick you've got maybe more of an injury risk prone player in calber Luen but if you go chooseing between the two and you're looking at those expected numbers and even you know the outperformance of of FPL points per 90 calv lein is up there with the likes of J Pedro and I think you've got two players there at the same price point really Welbeck as well who is in in that price bracket too who just probably are slightly better options for me than Jamie vardy now the algorithm is looking at a onee team I'm obviously talking a little bit about further than this they've got Everton at home who have been just seeming to score two and then just capitulate at the back in defense and they have got a weakened back line they are missing players I don't think that they're going to keep a clean sheet this week against Leicester and I think Leicester will score but I'm just thinking more long term with the nice fixures that Everton have coming up is vardy the long best long-term pick for you the algorithm clearly thinks at least on a onewe basis vardy is the player to go for in that fixture between Everton and Leicester rather than Calvin Le and then finally we'll just take a look at the bench which has got Lewis dunk fece and Stewart on there and now we'll have a look at my team because I'm conscious this video is going on quite a lot already but I'm hope that was useful uh and just taking a bit of a deep delve into like picking out one asset in the team let me know if you like that or not in the comments I can easily do that or not do that uh next week depending on how you guys respond to it so let's have a look at my side [Music] now so not too long on this one uh my team does look rather different though I've gone with the not Forest events I've gone with SS rather than going with veran so the other goalkeeper in that fixture I have kept luk goodine in for one week surely he can't troll me that much in one game week I've got some cover on the bench in minkovich if needed so that would be a double up on the forest defense if he ends up coming in stuck with Trent then I've gone with Davis at uh ipswitch who I think has been on decent amount set pieces looking very attacking iwi have some nice games coming up Southampton are a stinky team so happy to have him in for that one I've then gone with Luis Diaz in Midfield I've stuck with Salah Palmer and sell or so I've decided to go for them myself same as the algo just cuz I had money left over and then Lewis Diaz who came off early last week uh when Liverpool was struggling hopefully maybe Liverpool will be one or two up in this game already and won't be desperate to get gakpo on on that left hand side so obviously with jot and Diaz the issue at the moment is minutes I'm hoping di maybe grab two attacking returns before he comes off the pitch in this one and Bank the clean sheet Liverpool can seeed later on maybe and then finally up front I've gone with Watkins Captain instead I've gone with vardy still and I've added in calv Leen for kind of the reasons I mentioned before with Rogers dropped down onto the bench so why have I gone for Ole Watkin's Captain let's have a discussion about that [Music] now and there's not much more to be said than this is simply eye test and hunch is that what I'm going on with the Watkins Captain 5 .7 predicted points for this game week isn't a great total at all you've got Salah way ahead of him on 7.7 and Palmer and Harland not that far behind on 5.4 5.3 a piece so it's clear who the algorithm and the computer system is backing uh Wolves at home don't look like too bad of a defense either you've got Bournemouth looking weaker 1.61 expected goals conceded for them compared to wolves's 1.49 and actually if you're looking fixture wise Palmer could be the strongest option with West Ham's expected goals con seeded so far this season actually at 2.18 per9 you've then got an XG of the teams Liverpool looking like they're likely to score more goals obviously Man City very close behind there and then Palmer and Watkins a little bit further back so sorry if you heard any noise outside there by the way I've got my window open because it's quite warm in here uh and there's people slamming Gates and stuff so apologies about that uh and then finally the expected FPL points at an individual no obviously har leading the way but wkins is not too far behind he is in second 9.4 R seems to actually be finally able to put the ball in the net regain maybe a little bit of that confidence that we saw from him last season and at the euros and that's what I'm kind of backing on him to cash in on a lot of that XG um put away some more of those chances maybe the ones that Morgan Rogers even has created for once would be a nice change and that's why I'm taking the slight Punt and going with him as my captain so yeah that's going to be the end of this week's video hopefully you have enjoyed it may your arrows be green for game week five and hopefully I'll see you in the next one goodbye [Music],3180,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix youtube channel

one with salanki back i also like him as a onewe punt as well weve then got palmer at the 10m mark i think nailed on chelsea attacking option hasnt looked quite as good as last season in my view saying that he could easily cut mountain and bag another four attacking returns in one game now west ham have looked all right at home defensively in my view but i still think i back chelsea in that one to grab at least one or two goals and then salah doesnt need much discussion didnt look great last time out of course but i think liverpool rarely look poor two games on the trot and i think in a bournemouth home game when youve got harland and sacka facing off against each other hes going to be the standout captaincy pick and then up front for the weve got oe watkins lining up alongside jamie vardy and jamie vardy is an interesting one i think that hes one that ive seen a lot of talk around this week whether or not hes a good option to bring into your team and this is the thing where i would head over to the op the stats tool on fantasy football fix hopefully you guys can see this but ive ordered this by fpl points per 90 so how well these players are performing per 90 you can see vardy two rows up from the bottom hes played 330 minutes so far this season so a pretty significant number compared to some of the other numbers you see here youve got watkins only two 72 so far youve got jaia pedro 262 some of these players have just missed one game but 330 for vard isnt insignificant despite the notion that hell be hell be labeled with old not playing that many minutes he is still getting a decent number at least to start the season off in terms of points per 90 hes on 518 but he is in theory outscoring his expected data with his expected fpl points just to the left at that number 420 so when you order bu this expected fpl point hes not inside the top what is it 11 or 12 you have here hes even below alexander isach hes on the second page alongside the likes of munice who have stunk the gaff up so far so the datas not there to suggest vard hes not even reaching the levels of xg of antonio or munice and when youve got someone like a calvat luin here who could equally offer an option at 59m so only two2 million more i think that he might be the better pick youve got maybe more of an injury risk prone player in calber luen but if you go chooseing between the two and youre looking at those expected numbers and even the outperformance of fpl points per 90 calv lein is up there with the likes of j pedro and i think youve got two players there at the same price point welbeck as well who is in that price bracket too who just probably are slightly better options for me than jamie vardy now the algorithm is looking at a onee team im talking a little bit about further than this theyve got everton at home who have been just seeming to score two and then just capitulate at the back in defense and they have got a weakened back line they are missing players i dont think that theyre going to keep a clean sheet this week against leicester and i think leicester will score but im just thinking more long term with the nice fixures that everton have coming up is vardy the long best longterm pick for you the algorithm clearly thinks at least on a onewe basis vardy is the player to go for in that fixture between everton and leicester rather than calvin le and then finally well just take a look at the bench which has got lewis dunk fece and stewart on there and now well have a look at my team because im conscious this video is going on quite a lot already but im hope that was useful and just taking a bit of a deep delve into like picking out one asset in the team let me know if you like that or not in the comments i can easily do that or not do that next week depending on how you guys respond to it so lets have a look at my side now so not too long on this one my team does look rather different though ive gone with the not forest events ive gone with ss rather than going with veran so the other goalkeeper in that fixture i have kept luk goodine in for one week surely he cant troll me that much in one game week ive got some cover on the bench in minkovich if needed so that would be a double up on the forest defense if he ends up coming in stuck with trent then ive gone with davis at ipswitch who i think has been on decent amount set pieces looking very attacking iwi have some nice games coming up southampton are a stinky team so happy to have him in for that one ive then gone with luis diaz in midfield ive stuck with salah palmer and sell or so ive decided to go for them myself same as the algo just cuz i had money left over and then lewis diaz who came off early last week when liverpool was struggling hopefully maybe liverpool will be one or two up in this game already and wont be desperate to get gakpo on that left hand side so with jot and diaz the issue at the moment is minutes im hoping di maybe grab two attacking returns before he comes off the pitch in this one and bank the clean sheet liverpool can seeed later on maybe and then finally up front ive gone with watkins captain instead ive gone with vardy still and ive added in calv leen for the reasons i mentioned before with rogers dropped down onto the bench so why have i gone for ole watkins captain lets have a discussion about that now and theres not much more to be said than this is simply eye test and hunch is that what im going on with the watkins captain 5 7 predicted points for this game week isnt a great total at all youve got salah way ahead of him on 77 and palmer and harland not that far behind on 54 53 a piece so its clear who the algorithm and the computer system is backing wolves at home dont look like too bad of a defense either youve got bournemouth looking weaker 161 expected goals conceded for them compared to wolvess 149 and if youre looking fixture wise palmer could be the strongest option with west hams expected goals con seeded so far this season at 218 per9 youve then got an xg of the teams liverpool looking like theyre likely to score more goals man city very close behind there and then palmer and watkins a little bit further back so sorry if you heard any noise outside there by the way ive got my window open because its quite warm in here and theres people slamming gates and stuff so apologies about that and then finally the expected fpl points at an individual no har leading the way but wkins is not too far behind he is in second 94 r seems to be finally able to put the ball in the net regain maybe a little bit of that confidence that we saw from him last season and at the euros and thats what im backing on him to cash in on a lot of that xg put away some more of those chances maybe the ones that morgan rogers even has created for once would be a nice change and thats why im taking the slight punt and going with him as my captain so thats going to be the end of this weeks video hopefully you have enjoyed it may your arrows be green for game week five and hopefully ill see you in the next one goodbye,3066
5,fantasyfootballfixYT,IfFcnZ961YE,♻️ BEST ISAK REPLACEMENTS | TOP Fantasy Premier League transfers 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 5 Guide,2024-09-19T10:00:16Z,yes guys welcome back to another fancy football fix YouTube video my name is FPL nacho and in today's video we are looking at the top transfers going into game week five we have got a lot of injury concerns in the shape of OE Watkins and Alexander isach so we're going to discuss those players and the best players that you should bring in if they are ruled out as always if you look forward today's video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further Ado let's get into today's video so first up as I mentioned the theme of the opening part is going to be all about forwards and I really think that is the direction that a lot of managers are taking going into game week five we spoke about Alexander esack situation now a lot of managers did move away from him in gameweek four so congratulations to anybody that did sell him because if you didn't see he was ended up coming off at halftime with an injury we don't really know the extent of it right now and I always urge managers if you haven't made a move right now please do hold off until we get some clarification on the Friday's press conference but let's be real EDH how historically is a bit of a pain for telling the truth so we might not actually get any full clarification regarding Alexander esack but in the opportunity that we do we need to look at some options available and first up I want to take a look at some players that are priced around the same bracket of Alexander isak's 8.4 million we will be taking a look at some budget enabling forwards later on in this video so stick around for that so the three players that we're taking a look at are going to be spurs' Dominic sanki Arsenal's KY havitz and Aston Villa's Olie Watkins all offering brilliant opportunities to go to them in gameweek five and onwards so first up I want to quickly touch on olle Watkins of course being the most expensive at 8.9 million so you need a bit of money in the bank now there are a few concerns about olle Watkins being pictured with an ice pack around his ankle in the Champions League game against young boys now what we've seen right now it doesn't suggest that it is a new injury for Watkins we all know that he has been playing with a slight knock playing 60 65 minutes pretty much every game and it sounds like that was just a precautionary um substitution and he isn't necessarily a doubt for the weekend but again similar to the eack situation we need to monitor the press conferences to see whether he is available the problem with Watkins right now is that everybody wants to own him look at his underlined numbers right now 3.73 expected goals of four games is ridiculous only second best to of course erling Howland XA expected assist of 0.9 and 10 shots so the shot volume's there he's getting the big opportunities in this Aston Villa team and really you've only had the big Hall in game week four people who have owned him in the first four game weeks can count themselves unlucky CU he could have hold in any of the opening three games prior to that game in gameweek four and you can see here in terms of the expected FPL points 28 point 64 he is actually massively underperforming his underlying numbers and again when we take a look at the fixture for them in gameweek five at home against wolves followed by ipswitch Man United and Fulham it is a brilliant opportunity to invest in someone like an Ole Watkins whether you're wild card in in game week six you can have the Wolves at home game if you're looking to invest in him longterm you've got those brilliant long-term fixtures the problem of course with him is the slight knock that he's carrying I fully expect him to continue getting 60 to 70 minutes and the problem with John Durant coming off the bench and delivering every time means whereas last season unai emry didn't really have a choice he now has a brilliant alternative to Ole Watkins so he can actually turn Watkins in to what was PR for a 90minut man now and rotation risk for FPL managers so we need to decide whether the rotation risk is actually worth it over the other options available because Dominic sanki is a very difficult player to come to any conclusion to right now he's only played two Premier League games of course the injury taken him out of game weeks two and three so the minutes here of what we're looking at aren't really enough to come to any conclusion but he is the cheapest at 7.5 million 0.44 in those two games that he has played and it's worth noting one of those was up against Arsenal where let's be real the best defense in the league by far with the likes of Gabrielle and CA so we're not really coming to any conclusions right now on sanki based on his game week four before performance but what we can see is the performance of Spurs as a team and they really did struggle against Arsenal in the final third now will that be the case once again in gameweek five at home against brenford I don't think necessarily now brenford put in a great performance against Man City only keeping it to 2-1 the score line and that could be a difficult day at the office for all Spurs but if you're look for a differential in the game again maybe a onewe punt or a long-term option sanki does definitely tick those boxes but we are buying right now a player that hasn't had any deliv uh points delivered and it is a little bit of a risk naturally going for a player like that finally Kai havitz 1.94 expected goals 0.59 expected assists 10 shots brilliant underlying numbers and coming in 8.1 million slightly cheaper than Ole Watkins now gameweek five just isn't really the entry point for Kai havers away against Man City it just doesn't really feel like the best time to be moving in Alexander esac if we get no clarification on Alexander isak's injury status I'd much rather just keep him for this game week than bring in Kai havit however you absolutely do need to have Kai havit on your radar from gameweek six onwards leester at home followed by Southampton at home while double arsal defense probably is The Logical move that feels like goals in those two games and while Arsenal do score set pieces I feel like maybe trying to go for the double Arsenal attack over that period probably has the highest upside so if you're in a position right now where isach ruled out you maybe have a munes as well in your team and other inj is maybe just go Kai havocs in game week five while it's not optimal gets you put in place for the longer term perspective but of course if your wild card in in gameweek six then habits isn't an option at all so to conclude I think if Watkins does look like he is available even if he does Play 60 to 70 minutes those fixures coming up are fantastic so I still would probably have Watkins as my number one pick but it all comes down to what we hear in the press conference otherwise if you want a onewe punt I really do like Dominic sank at home against brenford the move unless your team is in tatters and you just need to bring in a player who is going to give you guaranteed minutes that one can wait until game week six where I think he's a brilliant double up with the likes of bakar Saka so let me know your thoughts in the comments isach wait until that press conference we hopefully we get some news so next up we need to talk about some budget forwards in the game because these two here are picking up a lot of traction in the community there are transfers coming in I can't believe it it's 2024 and we're talking about Jamie vardy still to this day but there definitely is some logic behind the transfers in for him and of course calv lean a player that I think we always like but his injury record speaks for itself and he is always a concern when you are bringing him in so first and foremost the two big caveats Calvin Le's injury history yes it is a narrative and you might just keep telling yourself that and it never comes but historically he does get injured and Jamie vardy let's be real isn't young anymore 35 37 I believe he is not going to play every single minute of every single game over these next four game weeks let's just be real this guy is going to play for Leicester 100% but I can't see him being a 90-minute man week in week out so if you're in a position right now where maybe you own a munz and you're looking to downgrade to a cheaper alternative because fulham's munes looks like he is now massively a rotation risk and I do think he will be benched in gameweek five DCL 5.9 million vardy at 5.7 million pretty similar price points and in terms of the expected goals Calvin Leen is leading the way at 1.32 compared to Jamie VES .74 calv Leen also leading his shots expected assists and general expected FPL points so all the kind of underlying numbers do lean towards Calvin Leen and in terms of actually investing in a team for the fixtures coming up obviously they play one another in gameweek five so it's very difficult to determine which team you actually would like in that fixture obviously with Everton they got Leicester followed by Palace Newcastle and ipswitch whereas Jamie vardy has a difficult game week six but with the price of 5.7 you probably would be able to just stash him away for one game week and then play him in the Bournemouth and Southampton fixtures so really I think just Everton have the better fixtures because you could realistically start Cal leing in all of those games but Jamie vardy is a brilliant onewe punt especially if you are looking to Wild Card in gameweek six and I think that's a big thing right now now managers need to understand exactly when their Wild Card period is you don't need to know the exact game week but you need to know whether you want to do it in gameweek six or not because if that is the case I do think Jamie vardy at home against this evidence team who was struggling defensively could be a brilliant differential for your sides but if you're maybe looking a bit longer term and you're looking to have somebody for game weeks five to game weeks 8 I feel a bit more confident investing in someone like a calv Leen yes he does have a history pass but for me I think until he actually does get injured we need to keep him in our minds as a good option at 5.9 million so for me Calin lein is a long-term option he's a great short-term option but if you are guaranteeing yourself a wild card in gameweek six I do like the opportunity of having Jamie vardy for one game we in isolation so let me know your pick of the two in the comment section be really interested to know I think one of these two could be making it into my team this week so talking about cheap enablers we got to take a look at the midfielders in the game because some managers are trying to save some money in their teams to change the structure of it if they do not have a wild card available and it's also worth noting if people are wild carding in gameweek five or gameweek six those players that we were really excited about the Morgan Rogers is at 5.1 Smith Rose maybe you're getting a bit out of fashion right now so we need to know who the New Kids on the Block are going to be and pretty much it's these three here Everton's mcneel Aston Villa's Onana and bournemouth's seeno it's also worth noting Taver has also been a brilliant pick at Bournemouth but I want to pick out seeno in particular because he has been fantastic in the opening four game week so you can check out the numbers here seeno and onano with two goals a piece McNeil with one but in terms of chance creation McNeil has been fantastic at 2.14 compared to S menu's 1.67 and basically Onana has just been a wrecking ball in terms of set pieces isn't really offering any much creativ in that Aston Villa team he is very much the destroyer boxto boox and very much a threat from set pieces we can also see the expected FPL points seeno leading the way naturally because he's so dominant in the expected goals column but in terms of actual FPL points it is Mcneil that's leading the way at 22 Onana at 21 and seeno at 20 so all three of these I really do think are viable options in terms of Onana I think there's a big discussion right now in the community about Onana versus Morgan Rogers Morgan Rogers is the one that everybody went for but Anana is basically everything we wanted from Morgan Rogers as a pick and when we do look at the underlying numbers in terms of the two Onana is currently leading the way but from an IT test perspective Morgan Rogers is always the one that's picking up the better spots in the team and controversially I still prefer Morgan Rogers in this Aston Villa team but Onana end of the day is the one that's delivering points week in week out for Aston Villa but do I think it's a sustainable underline numbers the answer is going to be no from a personal perspective but do let me know in the comments so if we're looking to buy for gameweek five or game week six onwards we need to take a look at the fixtures because the end of the day fixtures are King we spoke about Everton previously this is a good time to bit by Everton I know team itself and in terms of the results been really really poor but in isolation I think calv Leen and McNeil are considerations for your team we spoke about the fixtures as a great entry point this week if you're in a position where you're looking to move sideways or down from one of your midfielders in the game now in terms of Aston Villa again we spoke about Ole Watkins and his fixtures coming up the one thing I didn't note is the Champions League return now they've of course had their game against young boys the next game is going to take part between game week six and seven so that is going to be a consideration for FPL managers as well could that have an impact on the Premier League minutes with some key players like Watkins and Onana we don't really know the answer right now but again you are taking that risk if you are prioritizing an Anana who has European football compared to the other two options that we are looking at here in terms of seeno this is a very difficult one because he isn't going to be a buy for you in gameweek five away against Liverpool bourma have been great by the way and I do expect them to cause problems for that Liverpool defense but would I be buying seenu this week the answer is going to be no but if you were wild card in a game week six or even looking at a transfer Sano looks fantastic with Southampton at home and Leicester away and again with the combinations of your team you could just find a way of benching him if you wanted to when he plays Arsenal at home and then look bring him back in the team later down the line so in terms of the options for gameweek five and isolation I'm going to roll out seenu that is a gameweek six pick I actually do prefer McNeil over Anana just because I think his game time is absolutely locked in I think the fixtures are equally as good as Aston Villa's and there is no European football that we need to contend with fatigue minutes extra for the players are inevitably going to have an impact later down the line so McNeil is my choice I can't believe I'm saying that out loud but I do think he's a good option for gameweek five onwards if you want to bring another Everton into your teams so finally we need to take a look at the gameweek five predicted points and to be honest with you this is probably the most important one of the season so far because whereas in previous game weeks we've had some clear out out and out picks and that's going to continue in the graphic that you can see here this is a big game we for those managers that don't own moala because whereas in previous weeks Salah and Harland both had fantastic fixtures and it basically was whichever one you have captain in because it makes complete sense this week a little bit more different now mosalah has a brilliant fixure at home against Bournemouth I think it's a tough game but Bournemouth defensively are definitely there to be got at and moala rightly so if you own him should be your captain going into gameweek five especially based B on the predicted points at 7.3 but it's for those managers including myself that don't own moala where the problems are going to a rise because man city of course at home against Arsenal I back Erin hen did any fixture but historically this fixture has been very very close one Nils a lot of nil Nils and if there ever is a defense that is going to stop the run of earling Howland it is going to be the combination of CBA and Gabrielle so we need to remember that this is a big week for captaincy if you do own moala so for those managers that are maybe taking the risk on OE watkins's Fitness you could be rewarded with a captaincy on him 6.4 predicted points is really really solid and again do I think he'll get as many minutes as Howland no Howland is definitely the minute pick but you do feel like Watkins for 70 minutes probably has the same level as howand for the 90 against Arsenal so if you're going for Watkins and bringing him in I actually really do like him as a pick in your FPL teams but again even though erling Howland is playing against Arsenal the numbers are still decent at 5.9 predicted points so if you are in a position where no other option looks great just stick it on Erland Howland all it takes is a penalty or the form that he's in right now would you be surprised if he delivered in that game I think the answer is going to be no so Harland is still a good pick is he the best no there still are much better options out there outside of the top three we got Palmer at 5.1 million little bit concerned in the last game but I still think he is a great option if you do own him in a good differential e at five Trent Diaz jot Allison making up the quartet of Liverpool players finally son at 4.6 million who sorry 4.6 predicted points who I actually think is quite a good differential this week against brenford it does feel like one of those fixures where son could deliver but again let me know in the comments section if you are captaining somebody in gameweek five other than Mo Sala let us know because I'll be really interested because it is a very difficult week for Captain C so that's going to wrap up today's gameweek five top transfer video really hope it's provided some value and again let me know in the comments who is your transfer going into this week or are you maybe looking to roll the transfer with an eye on a wild card in game week 6 as always if you did enjoy the video make sure to drop a like and smash that subscribe button I will see you in the next video take care cheers oh,3558,yes guys welcome

brilliant differential for your sides but if youre maybe looking a bit longer term and youre looking to have somebody for game weeks five to game weeks 8 i feel a bit more confident investing in someone like a calv leen yes he does have a history pass but for me i think until he does get injured we need to keep him in our minds as a good option at 59m so for me calin lein is a longterm option hes a great shortterm option but if you are guaranteeing yourself a wild card in gw six i do like the opportunity of having jamie vardy for one game we in isolation so let me know your pick of the two in the comment section be interested to know i think one of these two could be making it into my team this week so talking about cheap enablers we got to take a look at the midfielders in the game because some managers are trying to save some money in their teams to change the structure of it if they do not have a wild card available and its also worth noting if people are wild carding in gw five or gw six those players that we were excited about the morgan rogers is at 51 smith rose maybe youre getting a bit out of fashion right now so we need to know who the new kids on the block are going to be and pretty much its these three here evertons mcneel aston villas onana and bournemouths seeno its also worth noting taver has also been a brilliant pick at bournemouth but i want to pick out seeno in particular because he has been fantastic in the opening four game week so you can check out the numbers here seeno and onano with two goals a piece mcneil with one but in terms of chance creation mcneil has been fantastic at 214 compared to s menus 167 and onana has just been a wrecking ball in terms of set pieces isnt offering any much creativ in that aston villa team he is the destroyer boxto boox and a threat from set pieces we can also see the expected fpl points seeno leading the way naturally because hes so dominant in the expected goals column but in terms of actual fpl points it is mcneil thats leading the way at 22 onana at 21 and seeno at 20 so all three of these i do think are viable options in terms of onana i think theres a big discussion right now in the community about onana versus morgan rogers morgan rogers is the one that everybody went for but anana is everything we wanted from morgan rogers as a pick and when we do look at the underlying numbers in terms of the two onana is currently leading the way but from an it test perspective morgan rogers is always the one thats picking up the better spots in the team and controversially i still prefer morgan rogers in this aston villa team but onana end of the day is the one thats delivering points week in week out for aston villa but do i think its a sustainable underline numbers the answer is going to be no from a personal perspective but do let me know in the comments so if were looking to buy for gw five or game week six onwards we need to take a look at the fixtures because the end of the day fixtures are king we spoke about everton previously this is a good time to bit by everton i know team itself and in terms of the results been poor but in isolation i think calv leen and mcneil are considerations for your team we spoke about the fixtures as a great entry point this week if youre in a position where youre looking to move sideways or down from one of your midfielders in the game now in terms of aston villa again we spoke about ole watkins and his fixtures coming up the one thing i didnt note is the champions league return now theyve of course had their game against young boys the next game is going to take part between game week six and seven so that is going to be a consideration for fpl managers as well could that have an impact on the premier league minutes with some key players like watkins and onana we dont know the answer right now but again you are taking that risk if you are prioritizing an anana who has european football compared to the other two options that we are looking at here in terms of seeno this is a very difficult one because he isnt going to be a buy for you in gw five away against liverpool bourma have been great by the way and i do expect them to cause problems for that liverpool defense but would i be buying seenu this week the answer is going to be no but if you were wild card in a game week six or even looking at a transfer sano looks fantastic with southampton at home and leicester away and again with the combinations of your team you could just find a way of benching him if you wanted to when he plays arsenal at home and then look bring him back in the team later down the line so in terms of the options for gw five and isolation im going to roll out seenu that is a gw six pick i do prefer mcneil over anana just because i think his game time is absolutely locked in i think the fixtures are equally as good as aston villas and there is no european football that we need to contend with fatigue minutes extra for the players are inevitably going to have an impact later down the line so mcneil is my choice i cant believe im saying that out loud but i do think hes a good option for gw five onwards if you want to bring another everton into your teams so finally we need to take a look at the gw five predicted points and to be honest with you this is probably the most important one of the season so far because whereas in previous game weeks weve had some clear out and out picks and thats going to continue in the graphic that you can see here this is a big game we for those managers that dont own moala because whereas in previous weeks salah and harland both had fantastic fixtures and it was whichever one you have captain in because it makes complete sense this week a little bit more different now mosalah has a brilliant fixure at home against bournemouth i think its a tough game but bournemouth defensively are definitely there to be got at and moala rightly so if you own him should be your captain going into gw five especially based b on the predicted points at 73 but its for those managers including myself that dont own moala where the problems are going to a rise because man city of course at home against arsenal i back erin hen did any fixture but historically this fixture has been very close one nils a lot of nil nils and if there ever is a defense that is going to stop the run of earling howland it is going to be the combination of cba and gabrielle so we need to remember that this is a big week for captaincy if you do own moala so for those managers that are maybe taking the risk on oe watkinss fitness you could be rewarded with a captaincy on him 64 predicted points is solid and again do i think hell get as many minutes as howland no howland is definitely the minute pick but you do feel like watkins for 70 minutes probably has the same level as howand for the 90 against arsenal so if youre going for watkins and bringing him in i do like him as a pick in your fpl teams but again even though erling howland is playing against arsenal the numbers are still decent at 59 predicted points so if you are in a position where no other option looks great just stick it on erland howland all it takes is a penalty or the form that hes in right now would you be surprised if he delivered in that game i think the answer is going to be no so harland is still a good pick is he the best no there still are much better options out there outside of the top three we got palmer at 51m little bit concerned in the last game but i still think he is a great option if you do own him in a good differential e at five trent diaz jot allison making up the quartet of liverpool players finally son at 46m who sorry 46 predicted points who i think is quite a good differential this week against brenford it does feel like one of those fixures where son could deliver but again let me know in the comments section if you are captaining somebody in gw five other than mo sala let us know because ill be interested because it is a very difficult week for captain c so thats going to wrap up todays gw five top transfer video hope its provided some value and again let me know in the comments who is your transfer going into this week or are you maybe looking to roll the transfer with an eye on a wild card in game week 6 as always if you did enjoy the video make sure to drop a like

fantasy footballfix.com YouTube channel with me Tom camell for another Elite 11 team Reveal video we've got mark back on the channel he's continuing his excellent start to the season as per usual and this week we're also looking at the gameweek stats from game weeks 1 through four as well as looking ahead to game week 5 to see how Mark is thinking of setting up his team moving into gameweek five so without further Ado guys let's get right into it guys welcome back to the channel for another game week preview and Mark welcome back man how's your season been going can see upward trajectory as normal things going well hey Tom how are you yeah things are going good um this is a season start like I've never had before three green arrows in a row uh unprecedented I'd say okay and let's let's see how long we can keep doing it definitely well definitely we're going to say that these videos are report to green arrows then let's let's get that in the marketing uh slogan I'm intrigued don't Mark so this is a this is a great start for for you as uh looking historically as well then I would have thought this is just you know par for the course so being around about 120k after four game weeks this is what we saying this is one of the the best that you've had yeah be bit unusual for me to be honest um I think I mentioned on the previous video that like my season trajectory seem to be pretty similar um game week one always seems to be good maybe game week two is good and I usually start trailing backwards and then I hold on for as long as I can to play the Wild Card uh so I'm kind of having slightly different thoughts this season I'm thinking that there's a good Wild Card week coming up maybe and if I can if I can get to game week six and then it be in a good rank maybe to wild card from a good position would be unusual for me I usually seem to wait till I get in trouble and then use it but maybe if I can be a little bit more proactive this time uh I can I can um you know preserve the rank and not just fright her at yeah well we'll see how that plays out and when we had Andrew on last week he was anticipating managers you know a glut of managers using the the wild card in in gameweek six so that that seems to make sense got a wasu mark around about 120k as I say right now what's the season aspiration looking like right now has it changed because of this strong start or is it pretty much the same as it was at the beginning of the campaign no I don't think it matters too much to be at 120,000 at this stage to be honest um you know I think if you're 500 600,000 now I think you've more or less got a still got a great chance of a top 10,000 and it's very easy for me to mess this up from here you know it's uh it's it's a small fraction of the Season gone I don't think it's a time to be getting too excited or anything like that so um yeah I'd be delighted to get top 10th out for a while so that's going to be that that remains the ambition That Remains the ambition and that is going to be what you're going to achieve and we're going to watch it happen over the course of this season season mate I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out Mark we're actually not going to look back on game week four points actually today we're going to look straight ahead to to game week five and do your team reveal in a moment but just in terms of how game week four played out was there anything that left out to you as a a massive concern ahead of gameweek five or were you pretty happy to roll your way through and and just and just see how things lay as we move into into game week five after these carabal Cup games and and Champions League games play out is is your team looking looking strong yeah it was kind of a mixed week in terms of um what it meant for my squad moving forward um so for example I I was fully sure that viol would start on Saturday and he didn't he got half the game and so that's a concern um I'm not sure whether the substitution was just you know pre-planned for halftime and it was guardiola's way of managing minutes for two players we always assumed that manager is going to start and rest St start players or you know give them 20 minutes at the end of the game and that's their rest but maybe Guardiola thinks I'll just give two players 45 um so I think vial is on his way out pretty soon um okay har Bellis I was kind of thinking that he would lose his place because he came off early in week three but then Stevens got a red card so he's back he's got a stay of execution but like he's still rubbish and you you know further up the pitch and getting concerned about J even though he's playing tonight and Liverpool are winning him um yeah you know I'm not feeling good about him no I understand that man all right cool well in in that case let's look forward rather than rather than looking back all of those ones make sense let's take a look at how you're thinking of setting up ahead of gameweek five okay so we're going to do this piece M Mark and just reveal these um through the different position so in goal you've you've you've opted to stay for Ry obviously I was going to say a tough fixture probably the the toughest fixture in the league away at at Man City You' got to be so pleased with Rey's start to the season and and that route into the Arsenal defense looks like The Pick of all goalkeepers right Mark yeah he's he's easily my player of the Season uh you know given the amount of points he scored and uh like his ownership is pretty low um he's looking like a season keeper for me at the moment I I don't not pun intended but I don't see how I change him um it's can I can I can I ask much just on him do you think he's the the best route to the Arsenal defense or do you still would you prefer to have a an outfield player maybe as a compliment to him or or instead of or is Rea just with 5.5 or or maybe up depending on when you guys are watching this this video is he just the best route into that mle arsal defense um I think he is um first of all he's a little bit cheaper than everyone else um secondly you know he's nailed um white is a little bit too expensive uh CA I think CBA is a good pick but there's a lot of Alternatives in defense when there aren't Alternatives in goal as we can see um Gabrielle is obviously going to be popular this week but I was just thinking about it today and I remember last season he got rested at home to Sheffield United and it was a proper rest you know and game week six he's got leester at home and if Cala fiori was coming near Fitness maybe that's a good day to give him a first outing I don't know what the status of his Fitness is um and Timber looks great um but I don't know you know how much he can play so yeah I think to go back to your question for me riy being my wild card and I I'm happy to spend the extra million over Lexa Henderson and so on R Rya got more on Sunday than Henderson's got all season yeah good point been a yeah been a bit consistent nice pickups hasn't there over the first um few game weeks so looks like a great pick on wild card or not like that of course looking forward into the defense then Mark you've got Pedro porro there um despite the the mockery being made of Poa kog right now and and Spurs his returns in the league he remains an FBI pick that's of of Interest I want to get your thoughts around him you've just mentioned howood bis as well so you can talk around you know the his prospects in the home game against IP switch and and him being preferred over gardiel and of course Trent Alexander are old a lots of money on on him as well so talk to me around your thoughts around this this back three Mark is anyone giving you concern or are you you pretty happy with how the defense is set up right now um no I'm not too happy with my defense overall I think it's fine for this week uh you know I probably will end up with varal in the team especially given How uh arsal approach to London Derby I don't think they're going to be too ambitious against city um har would meis is in there he's just scored tonight it's Tuesday night The League Cup is on and he's scored from a charity Taylor assist of all people um but Southampton are so bad um that I'd probably swap V all back in but it's a nice option to have I mean it makes me not too worri if one of the the three main guys doesn't line out at least I got har Bellis there to come in and possibly score a goal or two even yeah I won't R it you've mentioned Southampton being pretty wretched a couple of times already March you think they were getting into already targeting them if you've got players you know playing playing Southampton offensive players primarily uh you know scoring scoring lots of goals against them or them not not not scoring or a bit of both are we already into that territory after four game weeks well he's not in my squad now but I had a I had uh Brian Boomer for week three and I brought him in for one week just to Target Southampton um because they're wretched you know um the two goals that he scored were um mistakes from Southampton defense gosh yeah gifts yeah yeah I think yeah you are Tire getting Southampton um and maybe we'll get around to later on but some of my plans this week could involve maybe getting an IP switch forward okay um interesting just you know not not really based on the IP switch forward per se but more based on the Southampton defense being as bad as it looks like it is it's it's a case where they're trying to do something maybe they're not capable of doing in this league yeah agree they're playing out from the back and they remain Resolute about doing so don't they the manager been insistent about that yeah it's not the wisest you know it's um you mentioned past the kogu getting mocked a bit like whether that's justifiable or not one thing about him is he doesn't seem too adaptable in his approach and maybe Russell Martin is similar that's good point um so soo's um dogmatism Etc Mark Pedro parro you know not not the cheapest of FPL options you still comfortable holding him or is he is he going to be I mean maybe not so the question for gameweek five but longer term what are his prospects in the mark Mansfield team I think his prospects are good I mean he's very he's in a very unusual position on the pitch um no other fullbacks go where he goes he's he plays a lot of the time as an a he gets into the box late so he's just one of these guys you can play him anytime you don't know what's going to happen um and just there's just there's not a lot of standout Defenders really is there um so if you want to you know hold five five and a half million in a position like that in your defense I think he's as good as it gets really okay um so I'm happy to keep him I'm happy to play him any week I played him last week and yeah I'm really happy to have him against brenford this week at home makes sense he can do something course he can yeah and Trent Alexander Arnold obviously a lot of money being invested there in the I guess surprising home defeat against Nottingham Forest which will have pissed off I think obviously a lot of lot of owners in FPL what do we make of of of Liverpool now they started the three consecutive wins they now had this this upset now we worried is that just a blip what's your read on Liverpool Mark and and maybe if I do the team reveal the Midfield reveal now this might allow you to give some some additional context as well yeah like in terms of a read on them uh um the first game against IPS which I don't think you learned too much um the second game against brenford is a good win um but brenford don't play a low block away you know we saw him Saturday they went out against City and then United um just didn't do some pretty basic things well as we all know so the first time that they've come up against the competent low block that doesn't give them a lot of space in behind they they fell over that hurdle um so I think the jury is out in terms of their defense um because I don't think we can now say they're a good defense just because they kept those three clean sheets and I think the jury's out in terms of their attack uh just because maybe there was a little bit of creativity missing on Saturday um someone to unlock something um Salah didn't play well he's uh I've had an eye on the the Milan game here he's he's quite involved he's hit the crossbar twice he's had a shot so he's looking a little bit sharper today but he's been given space um I don't think Bournemouth will be as tight as um Forest work no so like the jur is out I don't know I don't know a lot about slot um but I'm not convinced yet that they're as good as you know there was a bit of a soft soaping going on for the first three weeks from the media and so on so yeah very much it's one of the things that makes you hesitant about wild card too early um not sure what Liverpool are yet no um J's playing up front bit uneasy about having him on Saturday I hope we get a leak um because you know he he he does something I think that other players in the Liverpool team can't do um so maybe he'll hold his place for that reason but he's missed a few chances he's missed one tonight um I'm a bit worried about his starting place on on Saturday and then he'll be out and the if I play a again wild C game week six he'll be out yeah makes sense and I guess the the jotter observations you're making there are not really new news in terms of him as an fbl option are they I think if you assure him minutes he becomes a an even more favorable option but we've never kind of had that Assurance have we interesting observations on on Liverpool there um Mark if we look across the rest of the the Midfield I want to start with with Rogers there um I've seen f see football fix put out some social media posts around the stats that he's aced through game one game weeks one through four having watched the game on sat on the weekend as well are we just just inevitably going to pick up points from this geizer at some point like what's going on Mark tell assure me it's safe to keep him and it's all going to be fine yeah I think it's yeah it's safe to keep him at five million I mean like what are you expecting here from a a guy that costs half a million more than a 4.5 million midfielder obviously expecting more but that's probably just just complete arrogance from me yeah yeah hoping yeah I mean he passes the he does do I mean there's no doubt about that he he really is a good footballer um and I just if he keeps his place the returns will come so he's not he's not on the Cho and block but I do have a strong front dat so I can I've been putting him in and out of the team I think I left him out in week one and he's played every other week but like there's a bit of a team here I'm you know I'm doing quite well but I'm still feeling a bit short changed on Trent H Jada and Rogers returns um and then eie missing the penalty not taking the penalty at the weekend like things could be going better here and I know everyone can say this about the team no you're right but I kind of feel like salah's really maximized his returns you know I'm not sure he deserve well deserved is a bad word he got them but like I think his points against United came very easy yeah um whereas Trent should have a lot more points I think CH should have more and Roger certainly should have more and as I right as well go ruled out harshly as well and gosh he played well in the open games didn't he I didn't have him then so I pretty pleased with that um I I thought it was interesting glasner came out at the weekend and said uh after the event he said yeah yeah we've got two two penalty takers which is what you would say if you're trying to you know uh ameliorate a situation that had a raisen like what else is he going to say yeah no kidding it didn't it didn't look a particularly um of acrimonious situation did it there on the week can but um yeah he was just bullied off it he was yeah we'll see whether or not that that happens in the next uh next game okay cool and and in terms of Smith row there as well um another budget option there mark someone who your expectations I guess are tempered slightly as a consequence of that and still still pretty happy with him yeah he's been uh he's not getting much fanfare is he no he's he's got 22 points everyone's been talking about uh Rogers M um seeno sm's done well but um I'm not really sure why SMI hasn't got any of these big bandwagons because um he's uh he's done well he's got a 10p pointer he's got a seven pointer yeah so yeah I'm happy to have him but I will probably tell him but I'm happy I got him at the start absolutely so you should be and then looking forward into this this front line and Mark of Harland the absent Xiao Pedro in gameweek four look at that with the arm band as well and isak uh hooked at at Hal time suddenly missing majority the of the game uh on the weekend disappointing a lot of of owners let's talk through this this front three Mark what's your what's your read on the forward situations in FPL right now well I think harland's good thank you thank you for that yeah the big bucks yeah um ISAC is like it's just been quite unlucky with ISAC I think it could be a whole different story if um sh didn't get sent off in week one yeah um and then he gets the ball in the head and he goes off I've always had I've had a feeling for years now that isak is just a bit soft I wasn't surprised he went off I didn't think he was going to Soldier on no um but I have got like I have got hit in the head with the ball before and got concussed I remember one time the the grass turned blue okay so I can sympathize with him to a degree but I do think he's a bit soft for going off there yeah um and then Joe Pedro's got the captain's armband and that really points towards my problem this week and it's a problem where I think there's a very obvious solution uh and it's a Sal captaincy okay um so I don't have a captain and that's really why it's Joe Pedro at the moment yeah well just before we talk around transfer plans and the moal suggestion there uh the xia Pedro captaincy though I was going to quiz you on there because I'm pretty impressed by Forest defensively I thought they ended the season well defensively and they've started this season well defensively as we're seen in the stats SL next as well in terms of for Forest as an as an option defensively do you think we're sleeping on them as a a budget friendly team as well Mark I've not seen much Personnel in anyone's team in terms of forest as well yeah you you've you've really caught my cabbage there because I was going to comment on that later on um Forest were third in the expected calls against statistic after three games which okay yeah whatever small sample size um and you think okay they're third now they're going to anfield where will they be afterwards they're still third um so yeah they're could be people I think are going to this weekend with Welbeck and Pedro I'm not sure I'd fancy it and like you know this is I I don't think I can Captain Pedro at home to Forest because of his minutes out and because Forest are good um so you know it's a question I have to answer who else do you Captain there yeah you can always Captain Howland umh if he's a doubt I think J is a starting doubt Rogers maybe like I'm running out of options here for captaincy I don't have a good one I don't think harland's always a good Captain Choice Mark right as you to astutely observed he's he's not a bad player as he so he is good you're you're right about that he's good all right let's let's let's talk around these so you've got two free transfers Mark obviously no Prospect of wild carding into um game week five here but what are your transfer plans then mate what are you looking at how are you going to accommodate Mo Sal in this team what's the what's the plan um I'm going to do I think what everyone else did last week and ship saaka and isak most likely um to get Salah and it cheap forward and all the great alternative uh thinkers of FPL have alternatively came up with the same idea and that's Jamie VY um I've made a you know a short list of people who could come in I've got I think 5.8 to spend there and it's a it's a pretty Grim watch list Mur row yeah yeah yeah it's got Danny Welbeck uh I don't want to get him for the reasons I mentioned it's got VY he's he's old but he scored a Jamie vardy goal at the weekend so like he's all right yeah there's strand Larson he looks all right but it's Villa so no yeah um R jimnez he's not playing tonight I he's my second favorite right now he's just he gets sneaky points he does well put let's talk about vardy quickly I mean we we we spent some considerable time slagging off Southampton earlier on in the video so um yeah just wonder whether or not is there a you know IP swi are they a attacking option here as well Mark do you think is that that a prospect that you're enamored with yeah the final name on my list is the lap um the lap went off early last week and his uh his numbers don't really add up no I think we all remember he he he banged one in against Fulham and it was spectacular and that's going to stick in people's minds but his numbers just don't add up in relation to you know to what vity can do I think no far enough V's getting the minutes as well surprisingly probably for most people I love it it's 2024 and one of our managers is is talking about bringing in Jamie vardy into their FBI team it's yeah it's going to be the bandwagon this week believe it or not yeah no no kidding definitely we'll we'll see that it'll be a party being had all over the place all right that's cool now um we mentioned it earlier on guys in the video that um we're going to start looking at statistics on a rolling basis on these videos so let's take a look at game weeks one through four stats and how they're playing out so far okay guys so what we've got here we've just pulled out six key metrics and and the idea here is that these will be rolling uh four week averages obviously we're only in game week five so happily we've only had four game weeks worth of data thus far and we've included a little caveat there or filter restriction to make sure that we uh exclude players who've not yet played 180 minutes so Danny yings unluckily will not feature on this video beyond that mention that I've just made of him so Mark let's start with the the team metric there the expected goals conceded um in the B right hand corner there you me mentioned Forest there do we like Fulham as well potentially as a defensive um Avenue for for budget friendly options or are we saying that you know it's down to Liverpool Spurs and Man City and you're going to have to spend big money if you want to get those mle defenses and I I guess Arsenal will inevitably end up in there in due course to what's your read on the on the defensive look in FPL so far yeah I haven't talked about it too deeply yet for the wild card um on Fulham I think uh it's a mixed one for Robinson Hors because they've had two late concessions but they've also got two assists which you know are a bit unpredictable I think the pick there might be Anderson at 4.4 okay um and he's he's going to improve the Fulham defense I'm not surprised he's come out of the palace defense and it's got worse yeah good point um at Forest uh I think we'll all be talking about Alex Marine if he keeps starting yeah and I also think is fine so for forgive the ignorance is Moreno though the the boy who plays left back for for Forest so he was the one who did such a good number on Salah on the weekend yeah yeah he's the guy who was at Villa until recently I yeah I was watching um the Liverpool game was on in Ireland so I was watching that on Saturday and I didn't have Salah so like I was like oh my God I shouldn't be watching this and I saw it was Moreno and I this is going to be horrendous and Marena did well he did do well yeah he did yeah yeah he really did uh yeah Liverpool had an off day but still you have to yeah you know you have to play well to get that win so if Ana and Mareno are getting their starts uh I think I'll probably get one on the the the wild card for sure and then I think Trent will stay in for everyone I'm happy with parro uh maybe maybe the wise play is to get two Arsenal defensive assets Roya and someone else yeah starting to look that way isn't it maybe not for gameweek five yeah you no not for gameweek five but like what surprises me on the Arsenal defense is like if you forget the summer um we all decided about um seven eight weeks ago that we all had to have two Arsenal defensive assets because they were clearly the best defense and then roll on to game week one and people have one or no Defenders I find that very hard to uh rationalize how how people don't have um Arsenal defense and I think it's going to change everyone's going to have HS or a second Arsenal Defender soon very soon yeah interesting and maybe it'll just take getting through that etad fixture before that starts to manifest inpl all right mate cool let's take a look then so we've got expected goals attempted assists shot shots in the box and expected FPL points obviously only four game weeks already Mark but is anyone standing out here that we haven't talked around yet that you want to devote some time to I guess olle Watkins would be a name that we haven't spent any time on he returned well in gameweek four what what what do you think about him as an option bearing in mind the Duran situation there as well what's your read on olle Watkins um yeah I I you know there's been doubts about him that maybe he's not been fit at the start of the season but not withstanding that he's played limited minutes and he's got really big chances in all the games like he could be a long long way where ahead of where he is now in terms a point if he was just doing some fairly fundamental finishing correctly mhm um I think you know Corey from the Elite 11 has had him since the start and I reckon he he kind of feels he's been a bit unlucky with that um if I had a set um I could sell Howland for Watkins this week and maybe upgrade some maybe upgrade J the Salah something like that and I'll consider it you know late into the week if I don't have if I don't get forced to move early on prices I'll definitely continue to consider taking Howland out for Watkins wow he has he's come off injured tonight well no he hasn't come off injured he's come off and got bandaged you know he's got a nice pack on his ankle and going back to your question where you mentioned Duran um I I think just to keep the piece Emory has to give Jan a start like he just can't keep saying to this guy you know you're not starting it just doesn't work you know in a team environment he's got to give him a start soon and you think that will come in game five potentially bearing in mind that you know they they played their Champions League game one 3-0 didn't they this evening but as you mentioned Watkins came off um after an hour didn't he so I think that could that could disappoint new yeah I think if Watkins isn't 100% yeah yeah I think if he's not 100% there's no reason not to play jant yeah um yeah fair enough so yeah I think Watkins has done well I think he's a good pick it's if you have the funds to do it and as people are saying repeatedly like the good thing here is the the pricing is difficult this season right makes makes the game better doesn't it definitely yeah no this has been a very uh varied season I think we see a lot of variation and it's good yeah okay the name I also wanted to get your thoughts on here we got no he's not in your team up but Lou Diaz was flavor of the month for a little bit there wasn't he and then disappointing game against against Forest there is he in the the same Diego jot type camp and actually could be a good pick there'll always be question mark s over minutes and returns as a consequence of that and you know it's it's a hold if you have him but not really a buy if you don't yeah I think it like it depends on going forward from here I think it depends on how you like to spend your you know 1:45 on a Saturday um if if you worry about team sheets then maybe J and Diaz arting for you um he'll have good days he and he'll have he'll have bad days same with j and if you worry about not getting starts you should stay away from the two of them but you know I think we've we've become conditioned to expect the rotation in the Liverpool front line but we don't know how slot thinks about this you know he doesn't when managers are in the job a long time they've got a bit more um confidence to rotate they know things a bit better slot's under pressure now so is he really going to start chancing players that he doesn't think are the best to be in the team like is he just going to put in Darwin or gakpo just because they're there I'm not so sure especially if he comes under a little bit of pressure yeah agree final question for me mate you mentioned him briefly uh seeno earlier as a budget friendly option there in terms of Rogers Smith row and seenu you got an opinion as to which one is represents the best value for money right now if you were to Wild Card would one or more of those guys be in the team what do you think of the budget enabling Midfield options there and the issue yeah the issue with s menu is his fixtures so he's got Liverpool now got two nice ones but then he has Arsenal Villa city um and I I couldn't be having that you know it's it's um it's too tough someone there who and I I was nobody was looking at until the weekend was is Mcneil yeah um see him there attempted assist poking out yeah and their fixtures are fantastic coming up um but again he's not really really one of my types of uh signings um but the the 5.5 bracket is just I think you you get someone there um I've got uh SMI Ro right now but I think you keep that place on a wild card and maybe you get seeno you know maybe you get minte um they're they're all good options like and it'll be they rob it AG green whether you catch their halls or not at the right time yeah yeah we even snuck Thomas such in nice to get a yeah yeah Tok to tokenistic West Ham mention in in all of my videos at some point if I can manage to shoehorn one in there's no Danny yings here is there Danny yings misses out because of the the minutes restriction I was forced to put on by my employers but there you go otherwise I'm sure he'd be in the conversation uh Mark well done mate love lovely start to the season Wild Card still in hand two free transfers all looking Rosy any final thoughts before we wrap things up um not really I mean just I think I'm going to last week I feel I took a fair bit of risk not having Salah you know when I look in the leagues around me and the ones I there are a lot of managers where who I rate they all went to Salah and I just thought I put it off a week and I feel like I I benefited from taking that risk and I think T taking that on again with Salah this week is just a step too far and have a chance here to kind of just lower my risk keep a good rank wild cared from a position of power so um that's where my head is at right now I've taken my risk I've benefited from it and now it's time to maybe just cash in my chip it well we're going to see how that that's going to play out mate over the next few game weeks will get you on soon it sounds like it'll be shortly after you've wild carded if things go to plan but I look forward to seeing how things how things going game week five and Beyond Mark and another another congratulations on a great start to the season thanks for joining us do please smash a like on the video leave a comment down below if you've got any questions for Mark I'm sure we can get back to you uh in the week and I wish you all the best of luck for game week 5 and I'll be back with you all next week take care bye-bye [Music]",6425,hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel with me tom camell for another elite 11 team reveal video weve got mark back on the channel hes continuing his excellent start to the season as per usual and this week were also looking at the gw stats from game weeks 1 through four as well as looking ahead to game week 5 to see how mark is thinking of setting up his team moving into gw five so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel for another game week preview and mark welcome back man hows your season been going can see upward trajectory as normal things going well hey tom how are you things are going good this is a season start like ive never had before three green arrows in a row unprecedented id say okay and lets lets see how long we can keep doing it definitely well definitely were going to say that these videos are report to green arrows then lets lets get that in the marketing slogan im intrigued dont mark so this is a this is a great start for you as looking historically as well then i would have thought this is just par for the course so being around about 120k after four game weeks this is what we saying this is one of the best that youve had be bit unusual for me to be honest i think i mentioned on the previous video that like my season trajectory seem to be pretty similar game week one always seems to be good maybe game week two is good and i usually start trailing backwards and then i hold on for as long as i can to play the wild card so im having slightly different thoughts this season im thinking that theres a good wild card week coming up maybe and if i can if i can get to game week six and then it be in a good rank maybe to wild card from a good position would be unusual for me i usually seem to wait till i get in trouble and then use it but maybe if i can be a little bit more proactive this time i can i can preserve the rank and not just fright her at well well see how that plays out and when we had andrew on last week he was anticipating managers a glut of managers using the wild card in gw six so that seems to make sense got a wasu mark around about 120k as i say right now whats the season aspiration looking like right now has it changed because of this strong start or is it pretty much the same as it was at the beginning of the campaign no i dont think it matters too much to be at 120000 at this stage to be honest i think if youre 500 600000 now i think youve more or less got a still got a great chance of a top 10000 and its very easy for me to mess this up from here its its its a small fraction of the season gone i dont think its a time to be getting too excited or anything like that so id be delighted to get top 10th out for a while so thats going to be that remains the ambition that remains the ambition and that is going to be what youre going to achieve and were going to watch it happen over the course of this season mate im looking forward to seeing how it plays out mark were not going to look back on game week four points today were going to look straight ahead to game week five and do your team reveal in a moment but just in terms of how game week four played out was there anything that left out to you as a massive concern ahead of gw five or were you pretty happy to roll your way through and just and just see how things lay as we move into game week five after these carabal cup games and champions league games play out is your team looking strong it was a mixed week in terms of what it meant for my squad moving forward so for example i was fully sure that viol would start on saturday and he didnt he got half the game and so thats a concern im not sure whether the substitution was just preplanned for halftime and it was guardiolas way of managing minutes for two players we always assumed that manager is going to start and rest st start players or give them 20 minutes at the end of the game and thats their rest but maybe guardiola thinks ill just give two players 45 so i think vial is on his way out pretty soon okay har bellis i was thinking that he would lose his place because he came off early in week three but then stevens got a red card so hes back hes got a stay of execution but like hes still rubbish and you further up the pitch and getting concerned about j even though hes playing tonight and liverpool are winning him im not feeling good about him no i understand that man all right cool well in that case lets look forward rather than rather than looking back all of those ones make sense lets take a look at how youre thinking of setting up ahead of gw five okay so were going to do this piece m mark and just reveal these through the different position so in goal youve youve youve opted to stay for ry i was going to say a tough fixture probably the toughest fixture in the league away at man city you got to be so pleased with reys start to the season and that route into the arsenal defense looks like the pick of all goalkeepers right mark hes hes easily my player of the season given the amount of points he scored and like his ownership is pretty low hes looking like a season keeper for me at the moment i dont not pun intended but i dont see how i change him its can i can i can i ask much just on him do you think hes the best route to the arsenal defense or do you still would you prefer to have a an outfield player maybe as a compliment to him or instead of or is rea just with 55 or maybe up depending on when you guys are watching this video is he just the best route into that mle arsal defense i think he is first of all hes a little bit cheaper than everyone else secondly hes nailed white is a little bit too expensive ca i think cba is a good pick but theres a lot of alternatives in defense when there arent alternatives in goal as we can see gabrielle is going to be popular this week but i was just thinking about it today and i remember last season he got rested at home to sheffield united and it was a proper rest and game week six hes got leester at home and if cala fiori was coming near fitness maybe thats a good day to give him a first outing i dont know what the status of his fitness is and timber looks great but i dont know how much he can play so i think to go back to your question for me riy being my wild card and im happy to spend the extra million over lexa henderson and so on r rya got more on sunday than hendersons got all season good point been a been a bit consistent nice pickups hasnt there over the first few game weeks so looks like a great pick on wild card or not like that of course looking forward into the defense then mark youve got pedro porro there despite the mockery being made of poa kog right now and spurs his returns in the league he remains an fbi pick thats of interest i want to get your thoughts around him youve just mentioned howood bis as well so you can talk around the his prospects in the home game against ip switch and him being preferred over gardiel and of course trent alexander are old a lots of money on him as well so talk to me around your thoughts around this back three mark is anyone giving you concern or are you pretty happy with how the defense is set up right now no im not too happy with my defense overall i think its fine for this week i probably will end up with varal in the team especially given how arsal approach to london derby i dont think theyre going to be too ambitious against city har would meis is in there hes just scored tonight its tuesday night the league cup is on and hes scored from a charity taylor assist of all people but southampton are so bad that id probably swap v all back in but its a nice option to have it makes me not too worri if one of the three main guys doesnt line out at least i got har bellis there to come in and possibly score a goal or two even i wont r it youve mentioned southampton being pretty wretched a couple of times already march you think they were getting into already targeting them if youve got players playing southampton offensive players primarily scoring lots of goals against them or them not scoring or a bit of both are we already into that territory after four game weeks well hes not in my squad now but i had a i had brian boomer for week three and i brought him in for one week just to target southampton because theyre wretched the two goals that he scored were mistakes from southampton defense gosh gifts i think you are tire getting southampton and maybe well get around to later on but some of my plans this week could involve maybe getting an ip switch forward okay interesting just not based on the ip switch forward per se but more based on the southampton defense being as bad as it looks like it is its its a case where theyre trying to do something maybe theyre not capable of doing in this league agree theyre playing out from the back and they remain resolute about doing so dont they the manager been insistent about that its not the wisest its you mentioned past the kogu getting mocked a bit like whether thats justifiable or not one thing about him is he doesnt seem too adaptable in his approach and maybe russell martin is similar thats good point so soos dogmatism etc mark pedro parro not the cheapest of fpl options you still comfortable holding him or is he is he going to be maybe not so the question for gw five but longer term what are his prospects in the mark mansfield team i think his prospects are good hes very hes in a very unusual position on the pitch no other fullbacks go where he goes hes he plays a lot of the time as an a he gets into the box late so hes just one of these guys you can play him anytime you dont know whats going to happen and just theres just theres not a lot of standout defenders is there so if you want to hold five and a half million in a position like that in your defense i think hes as good as it gets okay so im happy to keep him im happy to play him any week i played him last week and im happy to have him against brenford this week at home makes sense he can do something course he can and trent alexander arnold a lot of money being invested there in the surprising home defeat against nottingham forest which will have pissed off i think a lot of lot of owners in fpl what do we make of liverpool now they started the three consecutive wins they now had this upset now we worried is that just a blip whats your read on liverpool mark and maybe if i do the team reveal the midfield reveal now this might allow you to give some additional context as well like in terms of a read on them the first game against ips which i dont think you learned too much the second game against brenford is a good win but brenford dont play a low block away we saw him saturday they went out against city and then united just didnt do some pretty basic things well as we all know so the first time that theyve come up against the competent low block that doesnt give them a lot of space in behind they fell over that hurdle so i think the jury is out in terms of their defense because i dont think we can now say theyre a good defense just because they kept those three clean sheets and i think the jurys out in terms of their attack just because maybe there was a little bit of creativity missing on saturday someone to unlock something salah didnt play well hes ive had an eye on the milan game here hes hes quite involved hes hit the crossbar twice hes had a shot so hes looking a little bit sharper today but hes been given space i dont think bournemouth will be as tight as forest work no so like the jur is out i dont know i dont know a lot about slot but im not convinced yet that theyre as good as there was a bit of a soft soaping going on for the first three weeks from the media and so on so its one of the things that makes you hesitant about wild card too early not sure what liverpool are yet no js playing up front bit uneasy about having him on saturday i hope we get a leak because he does something i think that other players in the liverpool team cant do so maybe hell hold his place for that reason but hes missed a few chances hes missed one tonight im a bit worried about his starting place on saturday and then hell be out and the if i play a again wild c game week six hell be out makes sense and the jotter observations youre making there are not new news in terms of him as an fbl option are they i think if you assure him minutes he becomes a an even more favorable option but weve never had that assurance have we interesting observations on liverpool there mark if we look across the rest of the midfield i want to start with rogers there ive seen f see football fix put out some social media posts around the stats that hes aced through game one game weeks one through four having watched the game on sat on the weekend as well are we just inevitably going to pick up points from this geizer at some point like whats going on mark tell assure me its safe to keep him and its all going to be fine i think its its safe to keep him at five million like what are you expecting here from a guy that costs half a million more than a 45m midfielder expecting more but thats probably just complete arrogance from me hoping he passes the he does do theres no doubt about that he is a good footballer and i just if he keeps his place the returns will come so hes not hes not on the cho and block but i do have a strong front dat so i can ive been putting him in and out of the team i think i left him out in week one and hes played every other week but like theres a bit of a team here im im doing quite well but im still feeling a bit short changed on trent h jada and rogers returns and then eie missing the penalty not taking the penalty at the weekend like things could be going better here and i know everyone can say this about the team no youre right but i feel like salahs maximized his returns im not sure he deserve well deserved is a bad word he got them but like i think his points against united came very easy whereas trent should have a lot more points i think ch should have more and roger certainly should have more and as i right as well go ruled out harshly as well and gosh he played well in the open games didnt he i didnt have him then so i pretty pleased with that i thought it was interesting glasner came out at the weekend and said after the event he said weve got two penalty takers which is what you would say if youre trying to ameliorate a situation that had a raisen like what else is he going to say no kidding it didnt it didnt look a particularly of acrimonious situation did it there on the week can but he was just bullied off it he was well see whether or not that happens in the next next game okay cool and in terms of smith row there as well another budget option there mark someone who your expectations are tempered slightly as a consequence of that and still pretty happy with him hes been hes not getting much fanfare is he no hes hes got 22 points everyones been talking about rogers m seeno sms done well but im not sure why smi hasnt got any of these big bandwagons because hes hes done well hes got a 10p pointer hes got a seven pointer so im happy to have him but i will probably tell him but im happy i got him at the start absolutely so you should be and then looking forward into this front line and mark of harland the absent xiao pedro in gw four look at that with the arm band as well and isak hooked at hal time suddenly missing majority the of the game on the weekend disappointing a lot of owners lets talk through this front three mark whats your whats your read on the forward situations in fpl right now well i think harlands good thank you thank you for that the big bucks isac is like its just been quite unlucky with isac i think it could be a whole different story if sh didnt get sent off in week one and then he gets the ball in the head and he goes off ive always had ive had a feeling for years now that isak is just a bit soft i wasnt surprised he went off i didnt think he was going to soldier on no but i have got like i have got hit in the head with the ball before and got concussed i remember one time the grass turned blue okay so i can sympathize with him to a degree but i do think hes a bit soft for going off there and then joe pedros got the captains armband and that points towards my problem this week and its a problem where i think theres a very obvious solution and its a sal captaincy okay so i dont have a captain and thats why its joe pedro at the moment well just before we talk around transfer plans and the moal suggestion there the xia pedro captaincy though i was going to quiz you on there because im pretty impressed by forest defensively i thought they ended the season well defensively and theyve started this season well defensively as were seen in the stats sl next as well in terms of for forest as an as an option defensively do you think were sleeping on them as a budget friendly team as well mark ive not seen much personnel in anyones team in terms of forest as well youve youve caught my cabbage there because i was going to comment on that later on forest were third in the expected calls against statistic after three games which okay whatever small sample size and you think okay theyre third now theyre going to anfield where will they be afterwards theyre still third so theyre could be people i think are going to this weekend with welbeck and pedro im not sure id fancy it and like this is i dont think i can captain pedro at home to forest because of his minutes out and because forest are good so its a question i have to answer who else do you captain there you can always captain howland umh if hes a doubt i think j is a starting doubt rogers maybe like im running out of options here for captaincy i dont have a good one i dont think harlands always a good captain choice mark right as you to astutely observed hes hes not a bad player as he so he is good youre youre right about that hes good all right lets lets lets talk around these so youve got two free transfers mark no prospect of wild carding into game week five here but what are your transfer plans then mate what are you looking at how are you going to accommodate mo sal in this team whats the whats the plan im going to do i think what everyone else did last week and ship saaka and isak most likely to get salah and it cheap forward and all the great alternative thinkers of fpl have alternatively came up with the same idea and thats jamie vy ive made a a short list of people who could come in ive got i think 58 to spend there and its a its a pretty grim watch list mur row its got danny welbeck i dont want to get him for the reasons i mentioned its got vy hes hes old but he scored a jamie vardy goal at the weekend so like hes all right theres strand larson he looks all right but its villa so no r jimnez hes not playing tonight i hes my second favorite right now hes just he gets sneaky points he does well put lets talk about vardy quickly we spent some considerable time slagging off southampton earlier on in the video so just wonder whether or not is there a ip swi are they a attacking option here as well mark do you think is that a prospect that youre enamored with the final name on my list is the lap the lap went off early last week and his his numbers dont add up no i think we all remember he banged one in against fulham and it was spectacular and thats going to stick in peoples minds but his numbers just dont add up in relation to to what vity can do i think no far enough vs getting the minutes as well surprisingly probably for most people i love its 2024 and one of our managers is talking about bringing in jamie vardy into their fbi team its its going to be the bandwagon this week believe it or not no kidding definitely well well see that itll be a party being had all over the place all right thats cool now we mentioned it earlier on guys in the video that were going to start looking at statistics on a rolling basis on these videos so lets take a look at game weeks one through four stats and how theyre playing out so far okay guys so what weve got here weve just pulled out six key metrics and the idea here is that these will be rolling four week averages were only in game week five so happily weve only had four game weeks worth of data thus far and weve included a little caveat there or filter restriction to make sure that we exclude players whove not yet played 180 minutes so danny yings unluckily will not feature on this video beyond that mention that ive just made of him so mark lets start with the team metric there the expected goals conceded in the b right hand corner there you me mentioned forest there do we like fulham as well potentially as a defensive avenue for budget friendly options or are we saying that its down to liverpool spurs and man city and youre going to have to spend big money if you want to get those mle defenses and i arsenal will inevitably end up in there in due course to whats your read on the on the defensive look in fpl so far i havent talked about it too deeply yet for the wild card on fulham i think its a mixed one for robinson hors because theyve had two late concessions but theyve also got two assists which are a bit unpredictable i think the pick there might be anderson at 44 okay and hes hes going to improve the fulham defense im not surprised hes come out of the palace defense and its got worse good point at forest i think well all be talking about alex marine if he keeps starting and i also think is fine so for forgive the ignorance is moreno though the boy who plays left back for forest so he was the one who did such a good number on salah on the weekend hes the guy who was at villa until recently i i was watching the liverpool game was on in ireland so i was watching that on saturday and i didnt have salah so like i was like my god i shouldnt be watching this and i saw it was moreno and i this is going to be horrendous and marena did well he did do well he did he did liverpool had an off day but still you have to you have to play well to get that win so if ana and mareno are getting their starts i think ill probably get one on the wild card for sure and then i think trent will stay in for everyone im happy with parro maybe the wise play is to get two arsenal defensive assets roya and someone else starting to look that way isnt it maybe not for gw five you no not for gw five but like what surprises me on the arsenal defense is like if you forget the summer we all decided about seven eight weeks ago that we all had to have two arsenal defensive assets because they were clearly the best defense and then roll on to game week one and people have one or no defenders i find that very hard to rationalize how people dont have arsenal defense and i think its going to change everyones going to have hs or a second arsenal defender soon very soon interesting and maybe itll just take getting through that etad fixture before that starts to manifest inpl all right mate cool lets take a look then so weve got expected goals attempted assists shot shots in the box and expected fpl points only four game weeks already mark but is anyone standing out here that we havent talked around yet that you want to devote some time to olle watkins would be a name that we havent spent any time on he returned well in gw four what do you think about him as an option bearing in mind the duran situation there as well whats your read on olle watkins i theres been doubts about him that maybe hes not been fit at the start of the season but not withstanding that hes played limited minutes and hes got big chances in all the games like he could be a long way where ahead of where he is now in terms a point if he was just doing some fairly fundamental finishing correctly mhm i think corey from the elite 11 has had him since the start and i reckon he feels hes been a bit unlucky with that if i had a set i could sell howland for watkins this week and maybe upgrade some maybe upgrade j the salah something like that and ill consider it late into the week if i dont have if i dont get forced to move early on prices ill definitely continue to consider taking howland out for watkins wow he has hes come off injured tonight well no he hasnt come off injured hes come off and got bandaged hes got a nice pack on his ankle and going back to your question where you mentioned duran i think just to keep the piece emory has to give jan a start like he just cant keep saying to this guy youre not starting it just doesnt work in a team environment hes got to give him a start soon and you think that will come in game five potentially bearing in mind that they played their champions league game one 30 didnt they this evening but as you mentioned watkins came off after an hour didnt he so i think that could that could disappoint new i think if watkins isnt 100 i think if hes not 100 theres no reason not to play jant fair enough so i think watkins has done well i think hes a good pick its if you have the funds to do it and as people are saying repeatedly like the good thing here is the pricing is difficult this season right makes the game better doesnt it definitely no this has been a very varied season i think we see a lot of variation and its good okay the name i also wanted to get your thoughts on here we got no hes not in your team up but lou diaz was flavor of the month for a little bit there wasnt he and then disappointing game against forest there is he in the same diego jot type camp and could be a good pick therell always be question mark s over minutes and returns as a consequence of that and its its a hold if you have him but not a buy if you dont i think it like it depends on going forward from here i think it depends on how you like to spend your 145 on a saturday if you worry about team sheets then maybe j and diaz arting for you hell have good days he and hell have hell have bad days same with j and if you worry about not getting starts you should stay away from the two of them i think weve weve become conditioned to expect the rotation in the liverpool front line but we dont know how slot thinks about this he doesnt when managers are in the job a long time theyve got a bit more confidence to rotate they know things a bit better slots under pressure now so is he going to start chancing players that he doesnt think are the best to be in the team like is he just going to put in darwin or gakpo just because theyre there im not so sure especially if he comes under a little bit of pressure agree final question for me mate you mentioned him briefly seeno earlier as a budget friendly option there in terms of rogers smith row and seenu you got an opinion as to which one is represents the best value for money right now if you were to wild card would one or more of those guys be in the team what do you think of the budget enabling midfield options there and the issue the issue with s menu is his fixtures so hes got liverpool now got two nice ones but then he has arsenal villa city and i couldnt be having that its its its too tough someone there who and i was nobody was looking at until the weekend was is mcneil see him there attempted assist poking out and their fixtures are fantastic coming up but again hes not one of my types of signings but the 55 bracket is just i think you get someone there ive got smi ro right now but i think you keep that place on a wild card and maybe you get seeno maybe you get minte theyre theyre all good options like and itll be they rob it ag green whether you catch their halls or not at the right time we even snuck thomas such in nice to get a tok to tokenistic west ham mention in all of my videos at some point if i can manage to shoehorn one in theres no danny yings here is there danny yings misses out because of the minutes restriction i was forced to put on by my employers but there you go otherwise im sure hed be in the conversation mark well done mate love lovely start to the season wild card still in hand two free transfers all looking rosy any final thoughts before we wrap things up not just i think im going to last week i feel i took a fair bit of risk not having salah when i look in the leagues around me and the ones i there are a lot of managers where who i rate they all went to salah and i just thought i put it off a week and i feel like i benefited from taking that risk and i think t taking that on again with salah this week is just a step too far and have a chance here to just lower my risk keep a good rank wild cared from a position of power so thats where my head is at right now ive taken my risk ive benefited from it and now its time to maybe just cash in my chip it well were going to see how thats going to play out mate over the next few game weeks will get you on soon it sounds like itll be shortly after youve wild carded if things go to plan but i look forward to seeing how things how things going game week five and beyond mark and another congratulations on a great start to the season

lovely tables from the Fantasy Football Scout me Members area um so they're well worth looking at those videos uh find out who's the most attacking Defender are attacking teams who the Talisman are that type of a thing okay let's go kick off with a London Derby West Ham against Chelsea what is the late let's go for yeah homeside first what's the latest from West Ham ahead of this time all right yeah um lgre he was one of six managers facing media yesterday and he said that there was going to be a late check on Emon who took a blow to his knee I think in game we four and he came off then but he's avoided Serious injury uh L we called it a big knock so they're still evaluating him or kickoff the other concern is um ful Krug who was missing last weekend with kill's issue again he's an ongoing assessment it's not a serious one and he could be back okay right here and as for Chelsea um I mean everyone's waiting for the Reese James news he's going to be back surely he might be back at some point in this season but um not this weekend uh no guarantees on that first there either he's still out as is's another right back Mal Gusto so he oh um has been seen back in training along with Lavia but mesco said this afternoon that this game is too soon for Gusto so it'll be a makeshift right back it was um disasi last week uh it could well be fa this week so those uh two right backs are still out as are um as is Amari cyan and I think lavier again he was back in training this week I didn't hear him mentioned by moresa it's very close whether it be this week or next week they do get two players back that's Fernandez and juby Hall they were both ill last week I think that's the team you sorted but there was a um a few quotes uh one some prayers for Sano and two uh a reaction to a question about inko V Jackson because inko came on last week in anyone still got him uh scored the winner played as a nine in Jackson's position um but there's a couple of good quotes on the website if you want to head there now to um see what he said in full basically saying that Christopher and kongu is not a normal number nine he can play there but he basically utility man and he's got a very different skill set to Jackson okay righto um um apologies if anyone can suddenly hear um some kind of sort of loud sort of hissing noise basically the heavens have just opened here in Somerset and it is raining like about a month's worth of rain has just suddenly come down so um apologies for that the the gentle splatter of rain um there welcome some more joining us in the live chat um Jack um CH uh Paul I no oh Robin has paid for wifi on his flight for this wow that's a very good humble brag as well about the ion about you're flying as well and and can pay for Wi-Fi on it so uh we will try and give you the team news that you require Rob Robin um and rter dude says good day we can hear us loud and clear from Barbados wow um so that's good um hopefully it's hopefully it's not a downpour in Barbados at the moment it's really really terrible here um okay um let's move on Aston Villa against walls Aston Villa news came in late we also saw Watkins with some ice on his leg um midweek in the Champions League but will he be fit for this game he will yeah emry had already kind of reassured us on Tuesday night after that game he said he was okay and he's repeated those comments this afternoon he says he's 100% fit okay he has a problems Rec but he's he's fine now uh they've lost Phil who wouldn't have played anyway um nothing on cash his three to four week recovery period is about up now uh I'll I'll check the full press conference for quote on him but I've not seen him yet and there was a line on Mings and Kamar they've been out longterm with knee injuries and they're both back in full training so just match Fitness with those two now oh okay just a friendly warning to those in the live chat if you want to um use this time to just have a pop at people uh randomly wasn't us to by the way um this is not the place for it just move away from the keyboard there just a little warning there for uh one of you comment I've just removed um uh wolves what shape are they in for this yes they've got a bit of a problem at left back because anoran and too are still doubt um O'Neal had said after Wednesday night that thought you should be fit for this but he kind of backtrack a little bit afternoon he said there need to be checks on both toy and Ryan I Nori um neither of them has done too much training this week but they've uh still got time to prove the fitness um he said the rest are okay so we think mcara is fine um I think it's been just cramp in his cough but he wasn't mentioned so we think he's all right other than uh the four longer term ones um which include now bouer car trayor he's out until Christmas Jo wvs are watching brief for me I've mentioned this a few videos um they're they're fixes changed not yet not yet so we've got to wait a few more game weeks but when they do they become good um right up until New Year but so I am really keeping an eye on all these um uh wolves news especially because I might get one on my wild card in game week six and others are wild carding then as well they might want to consider a wolf's assets just park them on the bench uh Fulham against Newcastle um yeah I know I haven't got any Fulham news actually uh what is the latest from Fulham I've just seen this on sport news actually it's the same as last week so there's only venicius out um that is good well I see good news for Moon wiers I think you probably won to sell them anyway because he lost these players I don't know if anyone saw this I put an article on site midweek the BBC live texted claimed that you need to SC off with an injury but I didn't hear anything else elsewhere and Silva said this afternoon that venicius is the only one out so he's probably all right okay so mun is fine to play the only problem is he's not he's um probably not going to play that that doesn't look good the amount of minutes he got and he was taken off before penalty shootout and he's a striker I mean it can't get any worse really I mean if if the bag blew some raspberries at him as he was like coming off the pitch or something but um yeah he's he's on my bench I've got him but he's on my bench um Newcastle um yeah no I I don't have isach many people still do um first it was his nose then yeah it was potential concussion I saw a funny post with him with a pirates eye patch on and now it's his toe so what on Earth is going on with isaach yeah how said this morning it's both issues that are causing him to be a doubt so if he recovers from one it's not necessarily guarantee that he'll get over the other issue um as you'd expect from how nothing really definite uh he said that um uh there was a knock to his foot as well as the grace to his eye so he's got a combination of the two and then they're going to make a decision today he wasn't seen in training ground images on Wednesday on the site but I will point out if you're kind of new to this um spotting people in training ground for L yeah uh that is definitely not a guarantee that he's injured because there are some strategic um snaps being taken generally when someone's an injury down we've seen it a lot with Arsenal haven't we in the past yes you cast have done this before as well so don't read anything too much into that hopefully there'll be some sort of leak because I've got isack um they're not going to get K Wilson back either he's obviously isak's Deputy positional rival he's out now until after the October International Break um and how said if isak doesn't make it it'll be the Willis suer who's are Sumer signing from Shel United or very much more likely Anthony Gordon playing through the middle okay as he did against wolves last weekend other than that it's just the long-term ones lell bmann and Miley what's what what's your sense though having reported having you know being a student of hology for a while uh what is your feeling about eak playing I'd have to have a more of a look into um into what the uh sort of consensus is on online on VI crave and people like that on on social media I've not looked into it yet um often based on past president how's been Coy with team and then people have started we've seen a very classic example of AE Gordon who was much more of a doubt than than he said was for this one and he started there's been a few other incidents as well of of like will not being been ruled out and then he's been on the bench the next game so um if you're going off past precedence then how is Savvy with his his um PR skills and okay often players player when they've been rendered a doubt but in this case with them having two injuries I'll I'll look into it more this evening yeah okay um now Liverpool uh sorry Leicester Everton are next now this features well could feature two Strikers that people might want to get in um if they um have some Striker issues in their own team um of course Jamie vardy at Leicester will be popular I would imagine Calin leen's coming in some form um as in he's not being injured um and Everton have a great run so he could be a long-term option as well but let's go with Lester first um what what's the latest there yeah C said there was no uh change in the injury situation other than a few bumps and bruises so daak is obviously still out they do get Edward back though he was ineligible to play last weekend because he was on lawn from Palace but he's now available other than that I think it's as you will okay righto uh Everton um this was one of the lengthiest um tweets uh I can tell I can tell fantasy football C Premier member because there's uh there was quite a lot of text in this uh tweet um about Everton what okay well yeah I'll just sit back and you just tell me what's happening at Everton injury-wise yeah take a away I think there are 12 players mentioned in this uh article that I wrote yesterday on Eon and we'll start with the illnesses of which C Luan was one him Garner and mikeno they missed out on that to Cup tie with Illness but C lean and M L were back in training on Thursday and it sounds very much like they're going to be all right Garner actually didn't come into training on on Thursday and then they lost another person through illness which was Jack Harrison he got sent home D said he hopes it's something nothing uh that's the four illnesses are dealt with still got eight injuries to go um James James tarkowski has a back nigle but the hopeful on him he's trained again as of yesterday so it just sounds like he wasn't missed midweek there's a scan on Mike Lin who has been deputizing for for brwi uh he got a knock to the thigh so they're just checking if there's anything there um speaking of brwi him and pson are going to play for the under 21s this weekend so they're very close to comebacks okay obviously they're not going to feature in game week might see them from game week six onwards Coleman is out he's facing the longer spell out than was originally anticipated he's got an anle isue edrisa garar is actually not injured he won't feature against Leicester for personal reasons he's had a bement in the family okay and um chimti and brya are out longer term so I I think that's everyone blind what kind of couple together for Leicester um I don't know but you can see why is becoming more popular yeah by the yeah I I can't call this game um but there's a lot of potential here mcneel um um calber Leen and obviously vardy um Ed Edward as well possibly for ler someone's going to haul in this game I think I'm not sure who though um talking of hauling um I'm a new Salah owner didn't do it for me last week but could this week Liverpool against Bournemouth a lot of speculation about the Liverpool team Sheet because now champions league has kicked in we saw gakpo in action um as usual J started but he was replaced by Darwin Nunes but that's happened in the league um yeah what what's the first of all what's the latest and then what's your sort of General steer on who might start particularly in those those front three positions so injury latest Allison's freshed out he had a muscle injury actually sustained before Milan but it seems to have got worse since then and uh he didn't train yesterday they're going to see if he can train today and then if he doesn't then he won't feature other than it's just Harvey Elliot who was injured so yeah the um the rest of the presser the noteworthy courtes were about um as you mentioned there the front line options this one was more about Darwin V although if you read our um Scout notes on the Tuesday Night Champions League games there's a lot on there about gakpo vs because yeah gakpo would have started on Saturday had he not played 180 minutes for or near enough that for the Netherlands and then GPO went and delivered very good performance inan yeah that is a close call on ja Nunes um there was plenty of quotes this afternoon this morning sorry on on Darwin and what he's got to do to get a chance um sort of echoing comments klopp said last season about off the ball work I remember remember Club being quite lukewarm on Darwin's pressing Etc yeah U he seemed to get better at that he second season but then there was a quote from stop this afternoon again this morning where he said it's main about the work we do without the ball um uh we play a lot of games and I think he's fitter now understands de by day he's in competition with doo who in my in our opinion has done really well in the last game so I think I'll still side with side with dieo in the in the 11 yeah um I mean I because he yeah I was gonna say I'm an owner so I would say that but I also think that as well yeah he he he see he seems to be quick reent to hand down he hasn't him a start yet in any competitive match um yeah say he's getting better and you know there's nothing wrong with his confidence Etc but he did say Doo's done a done a good job you never know I mean sloth came with the reputation of not rot very much from P um and then sort of kind of undermine that by making two changes in midweek so um as he said himself this the caliber of opposition in the Premier League is very much different from the Dutch top fight he would have to use his Squad a bit more I will I will go with J think they predicted 11 this week um but keep tabs on what Emma's jump the waves aggregated lineups because they're obviously a good gauge of the Liverpool F yes sorry can I just bear with me a second sorry that was just my phone going off I hope no one annoyed anyone annoyed me but okay um yeah I think um I mean I am biased oh for God sake just bear with me a second I'm just going to turn my phone off problem okay yeah so um yeah uh I also think jot will start mainly because just watching Liverpool especially in that Champions League game just any games he just that off the ball they just seem a better side with him and dar Nunes he just hasn't done anything if Dar Nunes come on and scored a hattick then you have to think about it but um yeah um I think that I'm just finally just um I'm probably G to get Robertson in he's fine isn't he yeah he he didn't start in midweek but I do think that was more about uh about managing his minutes um Simas came in and it was him who was caught up field for that for that myang go so I did I think Robinson comes back in yeah yeah okay poies everyone uh about my my um phone going off uh it's linked into my computer as well annoyingly I don't know how I've done that I don't want it to be linked with my computer so basically when something like this happens and um yeah my um partner didn't get the hint when I hung up on her she Tred school again uh so I hope you s Bor uh Bournemouth what's happening there uh yes much the same as last week so Adams are still out and otara it sounds like it's going to be too early for him he's much shorter ter than Adams he's got a twisted ankle but uh yeah aala said that um probably too early they will get one player back not injury but ineligibility last week end and that's keer he couldn't face Chelsea because he's on loan from there okay right yeah okay let's move on to sampton IP switch as well um people in live chat suggesting that was Pep calling you know we you know we're influential but not that quite that influential uh what's happening at Southampton yeah Martin said yesterday that everyone's com through skar from the AFL cup they still got bazun out uh and small born and solaman as well they're shter term they should be back next week but not for this one Jack Stevens is suspended as well um now that's normally would be a footnote in terms of FPL but if you do own Harwood Bellis and you saw him benched last week because he is quite widely owned Harwood Bellis as a four million Defender he probably comes back in because Stevens is suspended for the next two league matches so this is his chance to State a claim again alongside Ben right you um IP switch as well a very good um sharing against Brighton uh last week um yeah how are they set up pretty much everyone's in training according to McKenna uh few knocks and niggles but we we've heard that elsewhere around the country as well the only two who were flagged were um longer term absentees Nan br and Harry Clark again they're back in training broadheads furest along and he could get some minutes and M said even Clark could get minutes if needed but they are well stoed with with Defenders at right back so um everyone is pretty much fit or at least injury free righto okay uh Tottenham against brenford um Tottenham have had um a few injuries I I I I'll come to you in a sec for the brenford news because I hasn't come to me yet um but um yeah um what's happening at Spurs um uh and particularly I think it's uh I think there was some news Well about odbert as well in this yes yeah he is going to be out for quite some time he sustained a hamstring injury in that window over of a cover R they're still assessing him and so don't the exact extent of the damage but uh and said this afternoon that it doesn't look good and he's going to be out for the next period Rich charon's a fairly off as well according to KLU so that's good news for salanki he's not trailing yet um we te O's fine he came off against Cy but I think I was just cramp and bua should be back as well minor injury kept him out last weekend but he's trained and he should be available okay lots of people suggested the phone calls from brenford news we're good but we just we don't have that level of of access for managers to call us up um uh um it's probably um about me going down the shop to get something I don't know run out of milk or something um brenford yeah completely clueless what's happening there I I know whist is going to be out for a while but apart from that what's else happening at brenford he is yeah uh I there is quotes on the brenford website from today but it's not about injury it's about Kevin sharder filling the void okay left by vissa as you said that he's going to be two months so and they're already without iGo Thiago who's out until Christmas and of course um 20y has left the club now so as we saw in midweek uh in the cup Uh Kevin Sharda led the line carali was kind of playing has a bit of a 10 floating 10 rooll behind him so those two will probably be charged with sort of central responsibilities going forward so I'll definitely have my eyes on them this weekend and see how how that pans out um Jensen still out as well tyus Jensen he came back from International Duty with uh I think it's a c problem hickey's out long term D Silva's out long term and I've already mentioned Chiago okay righty o um right okay let's move on Crystal Palace uh Manchester United um yeah usually there's lots of Manchester United at the moment lots of players potentially coming about but let's go with Crystal Palace first uh what's the latest there yeah chalar uh one of the new signings is nearly back but not quite in in time for this one so him and matus franka they should be back in contention around game week six um check theer is the newest addition to the injury list he came off with a tour problem in game week four he's been ruled out for weeks uh and still out as Chad Riad as well he's out for I think another two on at least to four red flags or pass okay um and Manchester United um yeah this this they they've got a usually got a lengthy injury list is it still quite lengthy yeah it's shortening a bit uh they've still got Yo myasia Lindelof and short on as red flags um but hland and mount are nearly back they've been in training this week and ten hog said yesterday that they are going to make a late call on their involvement whether they can I think he said whether they can start would suggest he's um he's going to involve them in the squad I'd be surprised actually if they get looking after after last week and the Bary game uh in case you hadn't seen um mazra and Martinez were flagged briefly after game week four because they came off against at but they swiftly recovered they were back in the squad against barn on Tuesday the only had cramp so all three of those are fine okay next up Brighton ning Forest um a lot of new Pedro owners um including myself um but will he be fit so one of our kind of headline stories then Pedro will he play yeah we sort of new in terms of Hur and uh reading his body language and quot and everything um he is back in training Pedro and he was on Wednesday TW because after the the win over wols and um H said then that he trained that day so uh he Then followed that up this morning with a press conference and said he will train today and then if you can train fully can do all the movements Etc then he'd be considered he did say at the end of that that we won't take any risks now he said that I think last week with Matt weer yeah and he didn't wasn't involved so if you are looking for a predent there is that line from last week I do think there are there different situations we had been out longer yeah and had trained as much and Pedro's obviously had at least two or three days of training um and you could argue even though Hera dismissed this earlier today you could argue that he he was missed last weekend but perhaps that's again owner bias on my part no no I think that's true and I think also some of his other comments about Pedro about how important he is to the team I you should say that about a lot of players but he was pretty much saying Pedro is really really important to our team and I think I mean I know as a as a Brighton fan and you know neutrals would have seen it as well you know watching on Match of the day or whatever saying that he you know basically how many times is Pedro getting a you know penalty or last minute goal um you know he keeps going um and he really he really is Central now he's also sort of central to the offer ball play and the way they play um yeah I mean he's going to really want him to play for this but at the same time he's not going to want him to be out for a month for example but if he ends up being out for a month to avoid him being out for a month that doesn't really make sense so um yeah let hopefully hopefully he'll play I certainly will start him and make sure I've got someone playing on my bench um meanwhile n and Forest I haven't had any n and Forest news in so what is the latest there yeah this was the last one I noted down before I came on a uh they are pretty much un Change from last week so danilan and sangari are out longer term sangari if people hadn't realize he's he's one of the 4.5 million midfielders who have been starting but he's got housing injury now and I think it's a couple of month Bal he missed out against Liverpool he's really close to recovery Nuno MH so could come back into it um but apart from that n says it's unchanged okay right oh just I'll answer a comment in the live chat shf Bantam says he suggesting benching Pedro um if you got a good alternative because he sounds dodgy for a start I personally would play him whether he starts or not I suspect what will happen either he will not be in the squad or he will start I don't think he will be on the bench and if he is I will happily take the last 20 minutes of the game against nonan forest with J Pedro coming on um he's on penalties remember and he is notorious for scoring late as well so um yeah he's he's the sort of player I'd be in a team where I'd be happy to happy to play him um even if there's a risk of him being benched and coming on uh but certainly yeah have a have a good alternative uh on the bench um and final game uh Man City against Arsenal um so so yeah doubts well not doubts I mean a definite um for Arsenal's Midfield star but um doubts over man City's Midfield star now yeah Kevin De bruyne came off uh I think a half time against in there on when was it Wednesday and um pep said today that he he feels a little bit better uh and could be involved although he did say that he's not really had time to assess him probably I was I was expecting nothing less from Pep um because they've had two days off In fairness to him they haven't really had chance to see him but it doesn't sound as as serious as originally fed I think it's a groin isue so it could be was uh Pep's answer to that question whether he he might be involved apart from that I think it's just Oscar Bob and on the sidelines he did also say that foron he thinks is ready for 90 minutes after back to back wow back to back second half sh okay um ahead of um Wild Card time for some um but um yeah with the Lewis Walker um I mean are they in direct competition or can they they can both play and um yeah because there'll be a lot of Lewis owners out there wondering yeah they both started last weekend Lewis was on the left and K Walker on the right um but I think that was more but resting garol and and Ruben Diaz for uh for the inter game um so I would based on how shaky Walker was and how shaky Stones was I think he pep will revert to full strength kind of the team with a few tweaks that were sent out against IND there okay so I think Lewis and and DS will be back in the St 11 here I think Walker I think they're trying to get him minutes ahead of this busy week but he he was a little bit Ry against brenford okay I think my my reading of it would be Lewis starts for now but I think medium-term there is there is that risk okay and that would put me off as a as a as a scaredy cat uh um sort of yeah non-risk taken fantasy manager yeah um Arsenal uh odard we know is out but is there any more about how long he might be out for no um this was a strange on this because it was a it wasn't really a press confence but it was a press comment it was it wasn't held in front of masses of reporters and he was just taking questions from a couple of journalists and a it look like a broom cupboard but it was probably just a a side room somewhere in Arsenal um and he said about order guards no there's no fresh timeline they're going to see how he develops in the next week and how the ankle reacts and then the um head of medical is going to give them an update on how he's progressing the timeline that the Norwegian doctor team doctor had offered was at least three weeks um and R out for the October International so um I wouldn't be expecting to see him before then uh elsewhere as you've seen rice is back from suspension and Saka was back from injury as well as CIF Fury yeah against Atlanta last night as expected we thought Saka will be straight back from that uh along with Ard though they still got injuries Marino's out Tommy ASU still out zenchenko has missed the last two with a car Year I'm not sure how long he's out for but uh but um yeah those five are the only only Flags Okay um I've got um a Roundup obviously there was a few missing ning and Forest and brenford for example um but I'll try and round up everything we've got there so available calv Luen from illness meleno talkowski should be available as well verer um adding competition at Spurs he'll be around basuma is going to play and don't be afraid of the ice pack uh on Watkins if you've seen any of those pictures midweek he's absolutely fine 100% available apparently uh questionable though uh Garner Garner I think so with his illness um Keane is um going to have a scan full crog uh Achilles problems could keep M utara Fitness worries um Pedro I put precautionary because he's been in training but he might be I don't think it's a fitness issue it's just whether they feel they can risk him or not but it seems yeah questionable Pedro is still questionable isak still questionable foot but I could have put ey nose head whatever in there um a whole bunch of things wrong with him apparently or apparently not Allison's got hamstring issues could keep him out um holand has got hamstring issues still um but he could be back Mount could be back from muscle problems 8 Nori's got a knock may keep him out de bruyne may miss the game with Arsenal because of groin issues branway is a major doubt um so I think he's play you mentioned he's playing in under 21 so he's a probably he's probably out he's out yeah yeah but you know he's he's fit to go on a pitch just not um at this level yet um out odard ankle problems um as we heard about uh just gay got bement can keep him out odbert muscle problems charison still got muscle problems Gusto Fitness Reese James the reason is simply Reese James again dor toe is issues and Shala is abdominal issues uh keep him out okay so that's that's everything rounded up there thanks so much everyone who joined us in the live chat great to see you here um especially for those paying to to see

attacking defender are attacking teams who the talisman are that type of a thing okay lets go kick off with a london derby west ham against chelsea what is the late lets go for homeside first whats the latest from west ham ahead of this time all right lgre he was one of six managers facing media yesterday and he said that there was going to be a late check on emon who took a blow to his knee i think in game we four and he came off then but hes avoided serious injury l we called it a big knock so theyre still evaluating him or kickoff the other concern is ful krug who was missing last weekend with kills issue again hes an ongoing assessment its not a serious one and he could be back okay right here and as for chelsea everyones waiting for the reese james news hes going to be back surely he might be back at some point in this season but not this weekend no guarantees on that first there either hes still out as iss another right back mal gusto so he has been seen back in training along with lavia but mesco said this afternoon that this game is too soon for gusto so itll be a makeshift right back it was disasi last week it could well be fa this week so those two right backs are still out as are as is amari cyan and i think lavier again he was back in training this week i didnt hear him mentioned by moresa its very close whether it be this week or next week they do get two players back thats fernandez and juby hall they were both ill last week i think thats the team you sorted but there was a a few quotes one some prayers for sano and two a reaction to a question about inko v jackson because inko came on last week in anyone still got him scored the winner played as a nine in jacksons position but theres a couple of good quotes on the website if you want to head there now to see what he said in full saying that christopher and kongu is not a normal number nine he can play there but he utility man and hes got a very different skill set to jackson okay righto apologies if anyone can suddenly hear some loud hissing noise the heavens have just opened here in somerset and it is raining like about a months worth of rain has just suddenly come down so apologies for that the gentle splatter of rain there welcome some more joining us in the live chat jack ch paul i no robin has paid for wifi on his flight for this wow thats a very good humble brag as well about the ion about youre flying as well and can pay for wifi on it so we will try and give you the team news that you require rob robin and rter dude says good day we can hear us loud and clear from barbados wow so thats good hopefully its hopefully its not a downpour in barbados at the moment its terrible here okay lets move on aston villa against walls aston villa news came in late we also saw watkins with some ice on his leg midweek in the champions league but will he be fit for this game he will emry had already reassured us on tuesday night after that game he said he was okay and hes repeated those comments this afternoon he says hes 100 fit okay he has a problems rec but hes hes fine now theyve lost phil who wouldnt have played anyway nothing on cash his three to four week recovery period is about up now ill ill check the full press conference for quote on him but ive not seen him yet and there was a line on mings and kamar theyve been out longterm with knee injuries and theyre both back in full training so just match fitness with those two now okay just a friendly warning to those in the live chat if you want to use this time to just have a pop at people randomly wasnt us to by the way this is not the place for it just move away from the keyboard there just a little warning there for one of you comment ive just removed wolves what shape are they in for this yes theyve got a bit of a problem at left back because anoran and too are still doubt oneal had said after wednesday night that thought you should be fit for this but he backtrack a little bit afternoon he said there need to be checks on both toy and ryan i nori neither of them has done too much training this week but theyve still got time to prove the fitness he said the rest are okay so we think mcara is fine i think its been just cramp in his cough but he wasnt mentioned so we think hes all right other than the four longer term ones which include now bouer car trayor hes out until christmas jo wvs are watching brief for me ive mentioned this a few videos theyre theyre fixes changed not yet not yet so weve got to wait a few more game weeks but when they do they become good right up until new year but so i am keeping an eye on all these wolves news especially because i might get one on my wild card in game week six and others are wild carding then as well they might want to consider a wolfs assets just park them on the bench fulham against newcastle i know i havent got any fulham news what is the latest from fulham ive just seen this on sport news its the same as last week so theres only venicius out that is good well i see good news for moon wiers i think you probably won to sell them anyway because he lost these players i dont know if anyone saw this i put an article on site midweek the bbc live texted claimed that you need to sc off with an injury but i didnt hear anything else elsewhere and silva said this afternoon that venicius is the only one out so hes probably all right okay so mun is fine to play the only problem is hes not hes probably not going to play that doesnt look good the amount of minutes he got and he was taken off before penalty shootout and hes a striker it cant get any worse if the bag blew some raspberries at him as he was like coming off the pitch but hes hes on my bench ive got him but hes on my bench newcastle no i dont have isach many people still do first it was his nose then it was potential concussion i saw a funny post with him with a pirates eye patch on and now its his toe so what on earth is going on with isaach how said this morning its both issues that are causing him to be a doubt so if he recovers from one its not necessarily guarantee that hell get over the other issue as youd expect from how nothing definite he said that there was a knock to his foot as well as the grace to his eye so hes got a combination of the two and then theyre going to make a decision today he wasnt seen in training ground images on wednesday on the site but i will point out if youre new to this spotting people in training ground for l that is definitely not a guarantee that hes injured because there are some strategic snaps being taken generally when someones an injury down weve seen it a lot with arsenal havent we in the past yes you cast have done this before as well so dont read anything too much into that hopefully therell be some leak because ive got isack theyre not going to get k wilson back either hes isaks deputy positional rival hes out now until after the october international break and how said if isak doesnt make itll be the willis suer whos are sumer signing from shel united or more likely anthony gordon playing through the middle okay as he did against wolves last weekend other than that its just the longterm ones lell bmann and miley whats whats your sense though having reported having being a student of hology for a while what is your feeling about eak playing id have to have a more of a look into into what the consensus is on online on vi crave and people like that on social media ive not looked into it yet often based on past president hows been coy with team and then people have started weve seen a very classic example of ae gordon who was much more of a doubt than he said was for this one and he started theres been a few other incidents as well of like will not being been ruled out and then hes been on the bench the next game so if youre going off past precedence then how is savvy with his pr skills and okay often players player when theyve been rendered a doubt but in this case with them having two injuries ill ill look into it more this evening okay now liverpool sorry leicester everton are next now this features well could feature two strikers that people might want to get in if they have some striker issues in their own team of course jamie vardy at leicester will be popular i would imagine calin leens coming in some form as in hes not being injured and everton have a great run so he could be a longterm option as well but lets go with lester first whats the latest there c said there was no change in the injury situation other than a few bumps and bruises so daak is still out they do get edward back though he was ineligible to play last weekend because he was on lawn from palace but hes now available other than that i think its as you will okay righto everton this was one of the lengthiest tweets i can tell i can tell fantasy football c premier member because theres there was quite a lot of text in this tweet about everton what okay well ill just sit back and you just tell me whats happening at everton injurywise take a away i think there are 12 players mentioned in this article that i wrote yesterday on eon and well start with the illnesses of which c luan was one him garner and mikeno they missed out on that to cup tie with illness but c lean and m l were back in training on thursday and it sounds like theyre going to be all right garner didnt come into training on thursday and then they lost another person through illness which was jack harrison he got sent home d said he hopes its something nothing thats the four illnesses are dealt with still got eight injuries to go james tarkowski has a back nigle but the hopeful on him hes trained again as of yesterday so it just sounds like he wasnt missed midweek theres a scan on mike lin who has been deputizing for brwi he got a knock to the thigh so theyre just checking if theres anything there speaking of brwi him and pson are going to play for the under 21s this weekend so theyre very close to comebacks okay theyre not going to feature in game week might see them from game week six onwards coleman is out hes facing the longer spell out than was originally anticipated hes got an anle isue edrisa garar is not injured he wont feature against leicester for personal reasons hes had a bement in the family okay and chimti and brya are out longer term so i think thats everyone blind what couple together for leicester i dont know but you can see why is becoming more popular by the i cant call this game but theres a lot of potential here mcneel calber leen and vardy ed edward as well possibly for ler someones going to haul in this game i think im not sure who though talking of hauling im a new salah owner didnt do it for me last week but could this week liverpool against bournemouth a lot of speculation about the liverpool team sheet because now champions league has kicked in we saw gakpo in action as usual j started but he was replaced by darwin nunes but thats happened in the league whats the first of all whats the latest and then whats your general steer on who might start particularly in those front three positions so injury latest allisons freshed out he had a muscle injury sustained before milan but it seems to have got worse since then and he didnt train yesterday theyre going to see if he can train today and then if he doesnt then he wont feature other than its just harvey elliot who was injured so the the rest of the presser the noteworthy courtes were about as you mentioned there the front line options this one was more about darwin v although if you read our scout notes on the tuesday night champions league games theres a lot on there about gakpo vs because gakpo would have started on saturday had he not played 180 minutes for or near enough that for the netherlands and then gpo went and delivered very good performance inan that is a close call on ja nunes there was plenty of quotes this afternoon this morning sorry on darwin and what hes got to do to get a chance echoing comments klopp said last season about off the ball work i remember club being quite lukewarm on darwins pressing etc u he seemed to get better at that he second season but then there was a quote from stop this afternoon again this morning where he said its main about the work we do without the ball we play a lot of games and i think hes fitter now understands de by day hes in competition with doo who in my in our opinion has done well in the last game so i think ill still side with side with dieo in the in the 11 i because he i was gonna say im an owner so i would say that but i also think that as well he see he seems to be quick reent to hand down he hasnt him a start yet in any competitive match say hes getting better and theres nothing wrong with his confidence etc but he did say doos done a done a good job you never know sloth came with the reputation of not rot from p and then undermine that by making two changes in midweek so as he said himself this the caliber of opposition in the premier league is different from the dutch top fight he would have to use his squad a bit more i will i will go with j think they predicted 11 this week but keep tabs on what emmas jump the waves aggregated lineups because theyre a good gauge of the liverpool f yes sorry can i just bear with me a second sorry that was just my phone going off i hope no one annoyed anyone annoyed me but okay i think i am biased for god sake just bear with me a second im just going to turn my phone off problem okay so i also think jot will start mainly because just watching liverpool especially in that champions league game just any games he just that off the ball they just seem a better side with him and dar nunes he just hasnt done anything if dar nunes come on and scored a hattick then you have to think about it but i think that im just finally just im probably g to get robertson in hes fine isnt he he didnt start in midweek but i do think that was more about about managing his minutes simas came in and it was him who was caught up field for that for that myang go so i did i think robinson comes back in okay poies everyone about my phone going off its linked into my computer as well annoyingly i dont know how ive done that i dont want it to be linked with my computer so when something like this happens and my partner didnt get the hint when i hung up on her she tred school again so i hope you s bor bournemouth whats happening there yes much the same as last week so adams are still out and otara it sounds like its going to be too early for him hes much shorter ter than adams hes got a twisted ankle but aala said that probably too early they will get one player back not injury but ineligibility last week end and thats keer he couldnt face chelsea because hes on loan from there okay right okay lets move on to sampton ip switch as well people in live chat suggesting that was pep calling we were influential but not that quite that influential whats happening at southampton martin said yesterday that everyones com through skar from the afl cup they still got bazun out and small born and solaman as well theyre shter term they should be back next week but not for this one jack stevens is suspended as well now thats normally would be a footnote in terms of fpl but if you do own harwood bellis and you saw him benched last week because he is quite widely owned harwood bellis as a four million defender he probably comes back in because stevens is suspended for the next two league matches so this is his chance to state a claim again alongside ben right you ip switch as well a very good sharing against brighton last week how are they set up pretty much everyones in training according to mckenna few knocks and niggles but weve heard that elsewhere around the country as well the only two who were flagged were longer term absentees nan br and harry clark again theyre back in training broadheads furest along and he could get some minutes and m said even clark could get minutes if needed but they are well stoed with defenders at right back so everyone is pretty much fit or at least injury free righto okay tottenham against brenford tottenham have had a few injuries ill come to you in a sec for the brenford news because i hasnt come to me yet but whats happening at spurs and particularly i think its i think there was some news well about odbert as well in this yes he is going to be out for quite some time he sustained a hamstring injury in that window over of a cover r theyre still assessing him and so dont the exact extent of the damage but and said this afternoon that it doesnt look good and hes going to be out for the next period rich charons a fairly off as well according to klu so thats good news for salanki hes not trailing yet we te os fine he came off against cy but i think i was just cramp and bua should be back as well minor injury kept him out last weekend but hes trained and he should be available okay lots of people suggested the phone calls from brenford news were good but we just we dont have that level of access for managers to call us up its probably about me going down the shop to get something i dont know run out of milk brenford completely clueless whats happening there i know whist is going to be out for a while but apart from that whats else happening at brenford he is i there is quotes on the brenford website from today but its not about injury its about kevin sharder filling the void okay left by vissa as you said that hes going to be two months so and theyre already without igo thiago whos out until christmas and of course 20y has left the club now so as we saw in midweek in the cup kevin sharda led the line carali was playing has a bit of a 10 floating 10 rooll behind him so those two will probably be charged with central responsibilities going forward so ill definitely have my eyes on them this weekend and see how that pans out jensen still out as well tyus jensen he came back from international duty with i think its a c problem hickeys out long term d silvas out long term and ive already mentioned chiago okay righty o right okay lets move on crystal palace man utd usually theres lots of man utd at the moment lots of players potentially coming about but lets go with crystal palace first whats the latest there chalar one of the new signings is nearly back but not quite in time for this one so him and matus franka they should be back in contention around game week six check theer is the newest addition to the injury list he came off with a tour problem in game week four hes been ruled out for weeks and still out as chad riad as well hes out for i think another two on at least to four red flags or pass okay and man utd this theyve got a usually got a lengthy injury list is it still quite lengthy its shortening a bit theyve still got yo myasia lindelof and short on as red flags but hland and mount are nearly back theyve been in training this week and ten hog said yesterday that they are going to make a late call on their involvement whether they can i think he said whether they can start would suggest hes hes going to involve them in the squad id be surprised if they get looking after last week and the bary game in case you hadnt seen mazra and martinez were flagged briefly after game week four because they came off against at but they swiftly recovered they were back in the squad against barn on tuesday the only had cramp so all three of those are fine okay next up brighton ning forest a lot of new pedro owners including myself but will he be fit so one of our headline stories then pedro will he play we new in terms of hur and reading his body language and quot and everything he is back in training pedro and he was on wednesday tw because after the win over wols and h said then that he trained that day so he then followed that up this morning with a press conference and said he will train today and then if you can train fully can do all the movements etc then hed be considered he did say at the end of that we wont take any risks now he said that i think last week with matt weer and he didnt wasnt involved so if you are looking for a predent there is that line from last week i do think there are there different situations we had been out longer and had trained as much and pedros had at least two or three days of training and you could argue even though hera dismissed this earlier today you could argue that he was missed last weekend but perhaps thats again owner bias on my part no i think thats true and i think also some of his other comments about pedro about how important he is to the team i you should say that about a lot of players but he was pretty much saying pedro is important to our team and i think i know as a as a brighton fan and neutrals would have seen it as well watching on match of the day or whatever saying that he how many times is pedro getting a penalty or last minute goal he keeps going and he he is central now hes also central to the offer ball play and the way they play hes going to want him to play for this but at the same time hes not going to want him to be out for a month for example but if he ends up being out for a month to avoid him being out for a month that doesnt make sense so let hopefully hell play i certainly will start him and make sure ive got someone playing on my bench meanwhile n and forest i havent had any n and forest news in so what is the latest there this was the last one i noted down before i came on a they are pretty much un change from last week so danilan and sangari are out longer term sangari if people hadnt realize hes hes one of the 45m midfielders who have been starting but hes got housing injury now and i think its a couple of month bal he missed out against liverpool hes close to recovery nuno mh so could come back into it but apart from that n says its unchanged okay right just ill answer a comment in the live chat shf bantam says he suggesting benching pedro if you got a good alternative because he sounds dodgy for a start i personally would play him whether he starts or not i suspect what will happen either he will not be in the squad or he will start i dont think he will be on the bench and if he is i will happily take the last 20 minutes of the game against nonan forest with j pedro coming on hes on penalties remember and he is notorious for scoring late as well so hes hes the player id be in a team where id be happy to happy to play him even if theres a risk of him being benched and coming on but certainly have a have a good alternative on the bench and final game man city against arsenal so doubts well not doubts a definite for arsenals midfield star but doubts over man citys midfield star now kevin de bruyne came off i think a half time against in there on when was it wednesday and pep said today that he feels a little bit better and could be involved although he did say that hes not had time to assess him probably i was i was expecting nothing less from pep because theyve had two days off in fairness to him they havent had chance to see him but it doesnt sound as serious as originally fed i think its a groin isue so it could be was peps answer to that question whether he might be involved apart from that i think its just oscar bob and on the sidelines he did also say that foron he thinks is ready for 90 minutes after back to back wow back to back second half sh okay ahead of wild card time for some but with the lewis walker are they in direct competition or can they can both play and because therell be a lot of lewis owners out there wondering they both started last weekend lewis was on the left and k walker on the right but i think that was more but resting garol and ruben diaz for for the inter game so i would based on how shaky walker was and how shaky stones was i think he pep will revert to full strength the team with a few tweaks that were sent out against ind there okay so i think lewis and ds will be back in the st 11 here i think walker i think theyre trying to get him minutes ahead of this busy week but he was a little bit ry against brenford okay i think my reading of it would be lewis starts for now but i think mediumterm there is there is that risk okay and that would put me off as a as a as a scaredy cat nonrisk taken fantasy manager arsenal odard we know is out but is there any more about how long he might be out for no this was a strange on this because it was a it wasnt a press confence but it was a press comment it was it wasnt held in front of masses of reporters and he was just taking questions from a couple of journalists and a it look like a broom cupboard but it was probably just a side room somewhere in arsenal and he said about order guards no theres no fresh timeline theyre going to see how he develops in the next week and how the ankle reacts and then the head of medical is going to give them an update on how hes progressing the timeline that the norwegian doctor team doctor had offered was at least three weeks and r out for the october international so i wouldnt be expecting to see him before then elsewhere as youve seen rice is back from suspension and saka was back from injury as well as cif fury against atlanta last night as expected we thought saka will be straight back from that along with ard though they still got injuries marinos out tommy asu still out zenchenko has missed the last two with a car year im not sure how long hes out for but but those five are the only flags okay ive got a roundup there was a few missing ning and forest and brenford for example but ill try and round up everything weve got there so available calv luen from illness meleno talkowski should be available as well verer adding competition at spurs hell be around basuma is going to play and dont be afraid of the ice pack on watkins if youve seen any of those pictures midweek hes absolutely fine 100 available apparently questionable though garner i think so with his illness keane is going to have a scan full crog achilles problems could keep m utara fitness worries pedro i put precautionary because hes been in training but he might be i dont think its a fitness issue its just whether they feel they can risk him or not but it seems questionable pedro is still questionable isak still questionable foot but i could have put ey nose head whatever in there a whole bunch of things wrong with him apparently or apparently not allisons got hamstring issues could keep him out holand has got hamstring issues still but he could be back mount could be back from muscle problems 8 noris got a knock may keep him out de bruyne may miss the game with arsenal because of groin issues branway is a major doubt so i think hes play you mentioned hes playing in under 21 so hes a probably hes probably out hes out hes hes fit to go on a pitch just not at this level yet out odard ankle problems as we heard about just gay got bement can keep him out odbert muscle problems charison still got muscle problems gusto fitness reese james the reason is simply reese james again dor toe is issues and shala is abdominal issues keep him out okay so thats thats everything rounded up there thanks so much

8,FFScout_,KNxOkXemBvE,FPL DEADLINE DILEMMAS GW5! 💥 | FINAL THOUGHTS! | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25,2024-09-20T08:39:25Z,[Music] [Applause] hi everyone welcome to deadline dilemas the show where prz and I take you through our teams hopefully covering our dilemas and your dilemmas at the same time PR how you doing I'm doing very well nice intro you're getting into the swing of things I'm trying I'm trying you know every week I learn something from you I mean the thing is uh so when when I used to do this with Flapjack last used to uh stream it live on Thursday this time now I always worry that uh you know because we upload it by Friday then news conferences and this week it's going to be so much dependent on what we hear in the press conferences we'll try to keep it scenario based right whatever happens tomorrow we will see yeah no totally agree a lot can change on the press conferences but I'm hoping I think a lot of the issues and stuff we're going to discuss still going to be just as relevant tomorrow with the press conference but there will be it's not an issue you know one small thing like you know now isak is fit or Xiao Pedro is fit it just changes like people or even confirmed out like maybe there's a new spanner there's a popular player that people own and that they're out and then everybody's panicking so I don't want to hear that PR because as you know every week I've gone from I've not had one week where I thought there's even a chance of me rolling not one and this week again we're going to see as we get into it which makes for good good viewing as we run through our teams but literally every week BR I've got issues and I've got dilemas to run through let's start with Rob's slide on just the 10 matches right I mean let maybe that's a good place to start in terms of our view because that doesn't change regardless of the one before this yeah so what games stand out to you apart from obviously your beloved Liverpool being the top goals uh expected as well as the highest clean sheet ODS so the Liverpool game like you said we we'll skip that we can come back to that I think the top game versus brenford that stands out to me because brenford when I looked at their stats they've been poor defensively they really are guess why obviously the projections are quite High there for more than two goals they've been poor defensively they're giving away big chances they've had given away loads of shots on target as well so that's a good fixture which could potentially be my transfer as we discuss our teams later so that one stands out for me the other one is Bo could be could be a Spurs player and uh Aston Villa against wolves the the the the chart shows like good projections for Aston Villa but then I watched wolves last week they weren't bad against Newcastle not quite sure like that one's still in my mind whether it's going to deliver the the two plus I think that Chelsea game with Wolves has people's has taken people's perception into something completely wrong because that Chelsea Wolves game I think on on expected goals or or XG wolves won or was it very close it was like 1.5 1.5 nothing like a 62 that no wolves got better XG that's what shocked everyone I think in that game yeah yeah so um yeah look I'm with you but I do think still home home to wolves is a good game it's a very good fixture what about you any other games that stand out for you well uh Man City Arsenal of course the the title decider potentially and also a little bit of a spanner for a lot of teams right I mean people with Arsenal picks are debating whether to start Gabrielle or people with Saka debating whether they should move him onto Salah and Captain or just hold off and just hope for the best I mean we're we're pting after Arsenal have played tonight yeah and they look toothless man like they look poor and today rice was back as well yeah but to be fair to them though PR Atlanta are a really good team yeah but are a really good team and then you know no yeah no man city are a ridiculously good team but you saw man man city so-called harand been scoring non-stop he places he plays a serious team serious Defenders and and he blanks yeah yeah so look what I'm saying is uh it's a it's a fixture that is important even for FPL because people are holding on to Holland people have one or two Arsenal players still so we'll see where that goes of course my team man united they're way to Crystal Palace we got battered there last season at the end of last season and so look I'm not optimistic on any game but the markets seem to think that we're slight favorites like 1.65 to 1.55 but look I am as owner and I think you should be bullish if you're as the owner like we do still give away chances and Crystal Palace even though they have been leaky at the back I think they're still good for a goal or two so I think this will be a good game something like a 21 two2 kind of game so looking forward to that I'm move you on that that's the game actually I've got highlighted for me it's added interest because two of my midfielders playing that game playing each other normally I'd be put off by that but in this fixture I'm I'm in agreement with you I can see two two perers around there that's how much goals I can see they yeah both teams look like they've got go in them but they can concede so yeah that I agree with you that's one of the ones I am keeping an eye on thinking oh this could deliver only issue is as I've got Henderson in Gold but yeah we move on we all do and we all you know I was having this conversation over the weekend with somebody and they were with Jack actually F Jack very good Feld manager he's a very good manager yeah Chelsea manager as well isn't Chelsea fan exactly Chelsea fan so uh he basically was saying oh people just hate Edison for no reason you know Edison is a good keeper he's been good for FPL and then I was like do people like any keeper like is there one keeper that everyone says I love this keeper like think of last season people don't like uh you know we didn't like pford at times we didn't like arola when we got him we didn't like duka Edison is always hated I think now everyone is converging towards liking Rya which I feel is dangerous because whenever we all love somebody too much they disappoint can I be honest that that worries me the same thing I was speaking to to another very good manager a friend and he was saying we're all excited about bringing ryer in especially after tonight in Champions League's penalty save you just watch you know what's going to happen isn't it like you said it's almost leading up to that it's almost like inevitable everyone's getting excited we finally got a goalkeeper at the best defense a good price point let's just just and it makes things worse because we've all had no goalkeeper returns so we're desperate we're looking at Rya every week destroying the bonus destroying the clean sheet so we're thinking we won a piece of that so I totally get you there is lingering in the back come on mind PR's like oh you know how he's going to troll us he will not troll Us by like Arsenal won't become a bad team he'll troll Us in the sense that we will want a fourth Arsenal and we'll be like oh we've gone R so now we can't get H or we can't get uh you know if Sterling starts playing or something that's how he'll troll us I that's how he'll get us I will take that if that's the worst it's going to get I will take that I was thinking more hardly and you know what man city do they win in three-nil last two minutes and they just concede for the sake of it yeah for shot as well how do you read the Fulham Newcastle game because obviously Fulham have been doing fairly well I mean last last week I didn't expect them to be winning one nil against West Ham until the 95th minute obviously unlucky this week Newcastle who haven't been amazing but keep winning I mean they have the same number of points as what Arsenal so how do you read that game very tricky game ful are been better than I expected this season per that's to answer your point fulam definitely doing well the for unfortunate last game week Newcastle I said it in last week's deadline dilemma they're doing the thing which all top teams do and they've done it again against wolves because they weren't great of course they were hindered by isak coming off and whatnot and they're very depleted I mean Gordon had to go up front which we'll discuss in more detail later but they done it again do press Barnes turned up and scored that stunner Shaw is obviously he always does that once or twice a season in random 30 yards top corners so yeah so this game here there could be goals in this as well you know no clean sheets in that game that's for sure there's going to be goals in that press two one to one of them I can't read it it's got Newcastle I think slight favorites but could go either way could go either way this is to me it's a draw like it's a one all one all maybe 22 or 21 kind of game something like that um but look I sometimes we say you know you you have this Championship form you make results work you score two outside the goal outside of the goal bangers you also got a bit lucky right I mean those are very low XG chances and those are chances that sometimes go in sometimes don't go in I think Newcastle have been a bit lucky they have been lucky where where they've ended up with the number of points they've got they've been completely rubish like even in the League Cup game that they lost to Forest I think was it yeah they were rubbish so fine they can keep getting results but they have zero interest from me after this week in in FPL terms yeah and AF still got trip on Newcastle just to I I hate them because from my game B one team everything is perfect apart from the three bloody Newcastle players I picked those are the three transfers that might end under delivered but I mean Isaac You could argue he's kind of close in four game weeks he delivered twice isn't he that's not too bad he had to deliver last week because people sold him last week you know when you know like Salah Salah delivered from me when nobody had him when last week everybody got him I was like no worries Sal it doesn't really matter I totally agree and especially for me do you know how so went into the last game week very optimistic until then everyone was having a shocker no problem but I still had two players in the bag in the last game week I had Gordon and I had ISAC so you can imagine P I'm watching that game of I'm I'm a proper Newcastle fan now fully like a Jordy and honestly when I saw Gordon go through he dinked past the two Defenders this in the first 10 minutes he went through and he smashed it and it went um hit crossbar I was like oh this we could be in something here little did that would be his best chance and then isach would come off so I just after that to be honest I just turned off the TV and I was like Su out this game week same same same all right so that's uh that's for the week um I think we'll refer to the Roby slide on the players when we talk about our own teams and our trans transfer decisions so you want to start with yours well go back to our to let's go to our teams let's let's talk about where you are what are you planning when's your wild right here we go so wild card actually PR I was close to going this week but I've managed to hold off to next week which is good so for me I didn't have a plan you was for example rigid game week six from the get goal which is which is cool I wasn't as um well planned as you I've had it in the bag waiting for emergencies and I'm I'm I'm there now I'm honestly I think I'm there so next week's a perfect time table I didn't want to go this week because of the Arsenal brenford for the similar reasons I think you've spoken about before as well so this week I line up with um Henderson in goal hopefully the last week I mean if our wild card then stays in there that would be special but anyway no chance even if he gets a 15p pointer against man united he's not St stranger things have happened pres but so Henderson in Gold Trent thirst defend and currently you can see the captain on him yeah yes I just noticed that okay yeah yeah the captain see we're going to come back into that a bit more detail let me finish the rest he's got a gorgeous fixture born with at home very good performance against AC Milan midweek they we conceded straight away but we didn't moan or Sal and know we we turned it because it could have easily been you know the narrative we forest all of a sudden we're losing we're going to crumble in fact one of my friends messaged me straight after that saying look you're crumbling already I was like give it give it tag but anyway so Trent and then beside him I've got Robinson and I've got consa so that's the the back four back three in the goalkeeper right there in Midfield I've got jot Bruno Fernandez e and Gordon so not too bad there yeah up front currently still got pedrol starting I think I would prefer him to Smith R who's my my first bench you came on for us last week and saved us so oh yes absolutely it was gorgeous wasn't it honestly absolute Legend but I've still I've still been ruthless and started Pedro ahead of him who pedrol started to train yesterday which was that Wednesday and he's got what two more three more days he should be back realistically hopefully hopefully harand who's got the most difficult fixture Arsenal and then I've got isach who's got the went from a eye problem to a nose problem to a toe problem now he's ticked boxes he's flagged as well so you could see and my bench is U same I haven't made no transfers yet so Matthews in goal backup goalkeeper then Smith roll howood and Hall he makes up my triple Newcastle so that's the team press what I'm thinking at the moment looking at this team so obviously I've got the two yellow flag players Isaak being the bigger concern more there's more money in him you have one free transfer one free transfer I've got 1.9 million in the bank oh now exact Watkins easy that's that's an easy move that is exactly the easy move hence why when you were speaking about the fixtures earlier on and the projected goals and points I went straight for the Villa one because that's the one I'm highlighting right I did try to consider remember last week PR you you you pointed out one which is again it's from a good fixture and that would be Bruno to son and but but Spurs have been a bit you saw them against centry midweek they just about won and Spurs are do opposite to Newcastle if Sean glimps is of good football but they're losing every game which is not ideal and son has not been that great he's numbers are not been that great on the left I hear you it's put me off I mean he would be a lovely that's a big punt that is because the fixture is perfect I think it's a good fixture and it's a really good fixture but they would play five at the back so I don't know if that suits him playing off the left uh I mean the thing is solanki played really well against Arsenal yeah but then in the Kaba cup didn't play well I didn't think in the first half but then he was playing with other random people right say yeah it's hard to judge him on that so so look I think it's still a good fixture and I think son is a decent Captain this week so if you wanted to do it but then Bruno isn't bad either like we just talked about it so yeah I I think it's almost and I mean if I'm so we're going to presumption my wild card in next week so I can do any transfer of course as long as I can afford it and don't worry about the repercussions so the son one I did actually try to think is it viable but I'm getting rid of son sorry I'm getting rid of Bruno and I've potentially still got two yellow flag players with a weak bench so that's not ideal the only other transfer so let's just say the Watkins one is the favorite move it's a straightforward one the only other one that makes sense to me as well is the Liverpool fixture against Bournemouth is lovely as well Liverpool after the M they're going to want Redemption from that notam Forest game if I get early news I could wait for Diaz I could go to Gordon and to Diaz but that would only be useful if I knew isak was fit otherwise his point yeah if that makes sense Presa could you do Robinson to Robo could do that yeah that that's a to be honest but the week before um the week before a wild card I'd want it to be an attacking not saying the robo one couldn't be at least Robo got rested midweek so I like that you have 1.9 in the bank right yeah so you could do Hall to Robinson uh Robertson yeah yeah so that would give you a fourth it would give you a bench in case isack and Pedro miss out you could I mean just something to think about like something to think about or G starting jaia Pedro to yeah but you need so oh okay actually to add another layer to it PR the player coming in ideally would want to be a captain don't think I've got Trent captaincy because it's my favorite I never normally Captain Defenders even an elite player Captain Highland what's the problem captain no nothing but well you say that you saw harl against inter he's gonna play against Arsenal they're going to deliver the same they're gonna of course he can of course he can score press but he's going to do this he going to play against Gabrielle and celba they're going to be you know what I mean rice and front of him they're going to be on him they will they will no denying that it seems like he I'm not saying he's not going to score but one like Max where potentially you don't think so would you prefer so in my position you would never Captain someone like Trent PR is that way too too look I think if the if the game was against Southampton or Leicester or you know Bournemouth is like a mid-table team and bmar an attacking team so the clean sheet odds like if you can see it's 40% 40% is okay okay like if I if I get to 50% type odds and I look for an attacking Defender I can look for you know a a Defender Captain but 40% clean sheet odds and relying on an attacking return I'm not there yet completely like I would say Harland is better I'll be honest I never C uh Captain um Defenders very very rare I normally I'm not scared to do like punts in captaincy I've done it many times I was looking at maybe even ezza or Bruno then I'm thinking maybe the player I bring in PR the captaincy so someone like Watkins comes in I just make him Captain see Watkins Captain is good but if he plays 60 minutes he's the same as Holland in my view if he plays 60 minutes yeah yeah if he plays but I don't think surely that's going to change now like they' done it against young boys midweek on the astral turf and he had a little bit ice pack but surely they ramp up the minutes now for him after that Everton performance I mean how long can that continue that phased return in uh you know I mean how I get it but but you have to also see that you know this other dude is playing so well Duran that it's sometimes it's just done out of necessity like he doesn't want to play two Strikers and he wants to give minutes to Duran as well maybe someone like Rogers could drop out for him potentially could do that maybe I'm just thinking I'm trying to it's I I agree he's going to have to look after Watkins it's a long season they're in Champions League we know how United Emory is of European football so I'm in agreement he will do he won't like put it far down on the priority list so I'm here with you on that that does put me off but then it puts me back in a predicament who do I bring in because ideally I want to bring in a captain so I am I am stuck here there's not much options for me well you could do jao Pedro to sanii or gakpo that's that's the one I was that did come to my mind as Spurs player so we spoke about son earlier on I did think sank I think the reason I've not mentioned him because I started a season of him so I think I've got a bit of a got I need to remove that resentment yeah I need to remove it because um yeah that's possibly if you still held him you won't have lost any value in him that's what I could you know a bit like Barco he didn't drop you know that that really annoyed me that did though price cuz I sold every other player that was destroying me financially I sold every one of them and he's the one he's the one I thought I checked it once one of the evenings that he's going down I thought you know what let me take care of him but anyway to be fair in hindsight it actually worked out because I B Pedro in against Arsenal so yes yes it did so you should like s salanki look I think I think my advice to you would be to separate captaincy and good transfer decision like captaincy for me Harland sets you a a a baseline in terms of that anything I think after Salah anything is harand or harand level so then you shouldn't be hunting for Captain you should be fixing the the weakest point in your team and I think the weakest point in your team is maybe that Robinson slot because this week look I expect Newcastle to score so only one week though PR if I'm wild carding game week six why do you need to be so concerned about fixing the week so you mean the we point for this game you mean for this game week you mean yeah I mean just Chas some points so so that's what I mean the weakest point this week and that weakest Point could be an injured player it could be isach who's injured then you get uh you know you could get Watkins if it's jao Pedro's injured you could just Chuck it and say I'll just play Smith so I'm just saying you could also save your transfer and roll it through the Wild Card which is a new luxury that we have in life uh and so we should enjoy that in life the only thing we the only reason I'll do that PR is uh if I got the all clear say press conferences on the Friday that Xiao Pedro and isach because I am on I as you could see on my bench I am in trouble um getting closer to using Hall Harwood and you don't want to be in that position so yeah you should you should be okay like having one very good like last week it paid off like having paid off a good first sub you have a good first sub and if somebody's out out you have one transfer so I think you look okay to be honest to me now the problem is if if there's a leak that J isn't starting what you going to do then then yeah I'm gonna have to that's a problem I mean to be honest J's becoming a problem anyways most be the last week for him in in my team I don't know about you PR we talk about that more but if I get the news that he's out I could go for a direct replacement go straight for Diaz o gakpo one of them I do think he starts but just like you said if the news comes out Liverpool's the early kickoff so we could get the information yeah not early it's at 3 pm. but we should at 3 p.m. sorry but we might still get early um information on the on team news that J's going to be rested this week but i' be surprised I think he'll start what do you think about the one I said to you earlier on then you didn't really comment that much on you didn't like it Gordon to Diaz if Diaz is star say you get the team leaked that no you're not feeling that because Gordon is going to start he's healthy he's got Fulham playing maybe be playing up front like I don't see he's not a weak Link in this team the weak links are a rotation risk jot if he's not starting a injury injured Xiao Pedro or could be fit but you know it's still a concern an injured is or a Robinson I think those are the four areas where I'm trying to sort of help this team with one we puns yeah yeah I think you're right there actually yeah maybe because I just I don't know I thought sometimes I look at it as well this is a good game week to try and bring if you haven't got Salah you're kind of on the ropes for captaincy this game week you really are you're you're on the ropes a little bit I think they're real tricky so I thought maybe this is the weaker I could get someone in that could do something I don't know maybe San is the news who do you prefer out of San and Watkins cuz I can afford both go to Rob T's chart next one there you go there's your answer it's very close so Watkins 56 and solanki 0. 51 now keep in mind this assumes that they all Play the full game yeah that's the the key so Watkins not playing the full game I think it's bang on the same as a Pedro or a salanki or even a jot look they're all 0.51 so I would actually say yes they're all 0.51 it's too close between all of them Captain the guy who's going to play 90 minutes and has a 0.69 per goals who everyone is else is not going to Captain don't have a fundamental issue like people will tell you Andy Martin will tweet if you're captaining Holland you know you wear socks in bed or whatever but uh it if he's the second best Captain he's the second best captain should you have planned to get Salah a little bit if you weren't unlucky with injuries yes fine to goand yeah I would have been with Salah I would have 100% been there but unfortunately every week has been you know like we've discussed and I've been given us true to true to the show dilemma every week but um yeah looking at this it shows you how good isach is still an option if he is fit look exactly there's no need to take out isack if he's okay if I see him in the training pictures I'm not selling him okay so you're yeah look I've got I've got more confusion in my head now prin this is this is the idea of deadline dilemas we don't solve confusion I thought incre your problems I wanted to speak to you so so you could decrease them I've got more issues now I'm more con actually I have eliminated for you Gordon to Diaz so I have helped you I have eliminated for you a fit esack to Watkins yeah that one definitely I wouldn't I agree I'm I'm with you on that even without checking the chart I think you remember last last week how high I was on isach I mean I didn't expect that it wasn't the first half wasn't great but I didn't expect him to come off that early if he plays on he's also been unlucky I mean I I do agree he's been unlucky he's got a goal and assist even though in one match he has only played 45 minutes and the other one they lost a player in the first half I exactly that yeah so look he has been unlucky yes so so overall I've got go back to my team I think just to finish off on my team like um yeah I've got I'm no clearer I'm going to see tonight see tomorrow more information tomorrow and maybe even I'm not value now I don't care about it so I'm going to wait till the last minute press for for the move value is the least of my concern I've way past that my team is uh on on sale I've leaked a lot of value everywhere PR so yeah yeah cool all right so we go to my team let's have a look at yours so it's not too different from yours actually apart from Salah being there instead of Brun apart from Salah being there yeah no but I mean really like you I have Henderson in goal as well I have Trent as well I have got kza did you have kza MH yeah you have kza so instead of your Robinson I have dunk which is which is nice dunk got me a clean sheet last week and I prefer his fixture this week to to Robinson so okay I I'll play him again but it's not like this is not a Robertson it's just dunk so um and then and then in Midfield again I have jot as well I have e as well so instead of mosalah and instead of Bruno I have Salah and instead of your Gordon I have Rogers and that's basically it because the front line is also the same it's isak jao Pedro and Holland so it's not too different but I also have two free transfers and I have 0.5 million in the bank so simple esac to Watkins if isak is out so that's the plan okay yeah but I obviously I W Captain Watkins I still Captain Salah but uh I think it's worth it like you know let's say jao Pedro's fit jot is starting then you you could also say just start Smith row instead of esack and just go there but I think it's worth it if he if isach is not playing with those with that fixture I think I'm happy to chance it and go Watkins so I'll use one of my free transfers but my hope is that isack is fine and in that case if jot is also starting then I will save a free transfer because then I will roll it again and I'll take three free transfers to my wild card and then enjoy life after wild card so that's that would be the plan because if ja out I'll just play mythro instead I don't think that's that's a huge that won't you won't bother with a transfer for that yeah and if an unforeseen injury happens somewhere you know like a u while people what is it the the warm-up injury or something before the lineup then Robinson comes on so it's not like I have a terrible second sub either it's actually pretty decent your second sub I'm starting him so it shows you you're a little bit more healthier from in that position and you've got Salah so transfer wise you seem pretty settled you know Wares confuses me if isak's fit he stays and if Pedro stays injured you'll just play Smith roll yes yes correct so you'd roll two transfers if both of them are fit yeah okay yeah you're really in a good position so there's a scenario in which I do two transfers and that scenario is if isach is confirmed out and jot is also not starting okay so so if isak is confirmed out I will do Watkins like immediately yeah but then let's say you know 15 minutes deadline before deadline J is not starting then I could do J to Diaz or I could do Xiao Pedro to vardy or DCL I think both of both those options are open actually I couldn't do J to Diaz because Diaz has gone up he's gone up he's 7.7 isn't he yeah so I can't do because if I use esack to Watkins I've used up my 0.5 oh your budget yeah so actually my only option will be J to vard or DCL which I think I'm fine with I'm happy with the a a vardi a v party last time it's a onewe pun isn't it really yeah so it's it's not too bad I like would Ben and just start Smith in that case that would be the plan team looks good captaincy is the one for you so you've been Sol 100% I mean you've obviously planned it for this for this game you've got Sol in your team you you've sold harand to be quite a bit even though he's playing Arsenal Shunk team you've not had any doubts even though he's been scoring he's my Vice Captain he's your Vice Captain if moala gets a warm-up injury I am happy to have Holland as my captain like I don't think there's a better captain that I own at the moment I think Watkins could be slightly better or if if similar it again comes down to your minute's expectation I don't have a Spurs attacker who could be similar I don't have Palmer who could be similar so I think it's that bracket like I think okay maybe Trent is also in that bracket You could argue but I want to see clean sheet odds better than 40% for me to go Trend which is I mean look we're on game week five now press I've not seen many clean sheets higher than 40% you know the odds they they're pretty they're pretty tight at the moment trying to get clean she sheet in the Premier League last week we had a bit more the week before we we only had Liverpool corre last week there was a couple of more clean sheets but it's yeah the stats when you look at the statistically there's not many clean sheets that's the only thing that's made me consider Trent and I do think we've been unlucky to not get a Mega Hall from him oh for sure for sure I mean the guy keeps getting returns in uh Champions League or for England basically not getting an attacking return for Liverpool and he's come so close there've been sitters missed by jot there was that goal that was ruled offside um so look there is a there is a high ceiling with Trent I do agree with you but I do also think that the floor could be just you know two points and while Salah gets a 12 pointer and then you really really fall back whereas with Holland I think one return you can see 62% of one return which was basically the market odds yeah I like those odds like 62% of one goal versus 40% of a clean sheet for Trent think of it that way because both are four points but with Trent surely this is the game where the goal or assist comes press this is the game this fixture here we're going to pin you're the Liverpool fan I'm not going to stop you we're going to pin B back they're going to be pinned in their half and Trent's going to be on the edge of the box at times surely this is the game week that's the reason I've got it on him even I'm taking a look I'll be honest with you PR I'm not 100% Sol myself like I said earlier Tren Defender caps SE how many I've been playing Foo now for over what is it 18 years I can't remember how many times I've captained the defender maybe at the start when I didn't know what I was doing the reality is yeah very rare so yeah for you you don't even need to consider that that's no chance you've already got yeah you've got Salah are you not worried about salah's blank last week to for salah's blank no no it's fine mil I don't know if you if youve caugh G of course I watched he should have scored two goals did he the ball was it hit under the barall press and bounced back out very strange like so look I hope people get put off by one blank U I think salah's a great cap this week see I'm I'm I'm it's worrying me because I know what the potential is in this game and I remember back was it about three four years ago perhaps I captained him it was a born with fixure early it was an early kickoff and he scored this Sol scored three goals or four goals and assist it was it was beautiful I thought it was Watford no he's done one against Watford I'm sure it's Bournemouth once okay okay yeah you know s he's done it against many teams but I'm sure once against Bournemouth he had a massive return it's fine it's fine you'll be fine tell me about your wild card six before we end the stream like what are your early thoughts what are you trying to think in terms of structure so I've only had one quick um like play around actually um couple of days ago and so the Arsenal players so for example the first starting point was Arsenal players if I'm totally honest with you so that's why I was looking around and um Rya was in all of the little permutations with Gabrielle actually two Defenders instead of two attackers yeah and I'm stuck in between the attackers press so um havitz versus Saka Saka the consistency the the Talisman plays every minute no matter how much he hobbles versus havitz who's been excellent since he's coming to the team last season and he's cheaper yeah it's what I can do with that money so that's the first starting place the free um Arsenal plays have you had a thought about the Arsenal players PR yeah I think I think most of us will be on double defense unfortunately like if odard was fit and you could see havs playing up top I was looking at havs but with double defense like look at how pragmatic they are with Spurs tonight with with Atlanta it just screams for double Arsenal defense you just get a Gabrielle and you get a Rya and you sit and enjoy points for the rest of the season basically um and and and I I am firmly a Saka boy instead of a Havard SP Bo because of his positioning as well so for me my triple up is going to be pretty much unless I change from from Rya to a fleen and then get saliva as well but it's going to be double defense plus plus Saka I think that's where I am okay and then yeah see that one I'm still not 100% sure that tells you I'm not you you've mostly like cemented a couple of permat couple of drafts already and locked in for me no nothing is nothing one one injury changes everything of course no but I mean I'm still I'm still playing around so Liverpool players I still wanted to keep some so I wanted to keep Trent who's one of my favorite Assets in FP this season but then the money it's caused me problems I think when I've done a couple of permutations the money was causing me an issue Salah was in Salah wasn't in my team don't play in your wild cards none no you need don't from from game week six onwards right uh you have Crystal Palace away Chelsea home Arsenal away Brighton home Aston Villa home now they've got three good home games but those are all top 10 teams like Villa is a top 10 team Brighton's a top 10 team Chelsea is a top 10 team Arsenal away is the toughest fixture in the league that one you can see in game week n and then Crystal Palace away West and wolves away are are decent but I don't think I'll be caping saline even a single one out of those and so I'm actually thinking and this is going to be a little different from what you've seen is basically get Saka Holland and Palmer and basically have that that differential Palmer that not a lot of people can get to especially those who are not wild carding yeah yeah and that could be a little Edge because I think we've lost two important components coming into game week six number one is this third Striker or second Striker right I mean I can't think of a good second Striker now because Watkins is expensive not getting the minutes esac is not great with the with the fixtures as well havs has become a less of an option soank is a question mark Jackson is okay but a question mark then you come way down the two cheap Strikers are still good doess so like mention you can do Calbert Luen you can do Xiao Pedro you can do vardy something like that wood wood is still viable oh wood is also okay yeah yeah and then in Midfield I I also feel like A's appeal has reduced a little bit so so you can basically make a structure with Palmer Saka bumo couple of maybe an or couple of Cheaper mids like five five and a half million and then you have a harand and two other cheap Strikers and you have your rock and roll defense with Rya Gabrielle maybe even a porro a trend and I think that that's where I'm trying to go so I do like okay there's something I want to speak about we're going to come back to that E before we jump back onto that e now watching the Clips back that didn't look like a discussion PR that looked like glasner put some nice PR there that looked like the big bully meta said give me that ball it's my penalty this so it's going to be interested what happens in the next um penalty situation that didn't look like a discussion to if you had a discussion you talk before the game or after if you do talk near the ball it's a quick one but the way they were looking at each other and and then and kti had to come and stop stop them that told me there's no discussion there pres there I think Mata is also by the way in the striker discussion Mata could be interesting as well if he's going to keep the pens I think at this stage we don't know like I would say you should we should assume 50/50 because e is still a you know a club leader a Talisman in in open play as well so maybe after the game they've agreed okay you take the next one I'm not going to speculate on that but I think what we now know is he's not 100% on penalties maybe people knew this before I didn't but now we know he's not 100% on it and when somebody's not 100% on it and he's playing for a team that is that has lost like three out of the first four or something like that then it it can be something that you can avoid but also if you go for him I think it's fine so I think he becomes a an option which is basically if you go it's fine if you don't go it's fine a bit like jot in game big one right some people went some people didn't go it is not the end of the world for anyone so I think that's how he becomes a little bit and that's okay there's two other players you didn't mention and I I want to bring them up on potential wild cards and we're only we're only touching base because next week's deadline Le is going to be excellent we're both on wild card that's going to be that's going to be a real good one but uh boing you don't I know I like him as well you know PR and I've considered him I think I had him a couple of permutations I know the fixtures get even more juicier after game week 10 but he could be one of the players it's a long-term pick you just put him in and and hope he's been doing not bad he's going under the radar he is he is and I think as a midfielder I think after bumo in that price bracket I think he's up there like if you're looking at 7 and a half six and a half to seven and a half midfielders he's up there and you know at the moment I would say if you had the money may be better than e because of you know just the sheer number of uh good games that they have coming up and him his minutes are still up there similar to a I think he's a good pick if you can fit him in I if I'm trying to jam in a third premium I mean Palmer is not a premium then for me it's not an option but for people who are basically you can bring uh Palmer down to a Bruno or even a boen and I think there there are things that can open up with that I was going to ask you about I've already got him your boy Bruno you is he been any permutations of your wild cards or not yet per not mine no I don't consider him it's only because I like man united I like watching them and I get doubled down if if my man united player is not doing well and the team is not doing well I would be happy regardless if he scores an assist or a goal I'm happy so it's it's it's that one thing last season I didn't enjoy going for double man united midfielders in the beginning and I was it tilted me in terms of decision- making because because man united was doing poorly and my FPL team was doing poorly so I'm going to remove that and if people want to go for Bruno I think he's fine I don't think he's the machine that people make him out to be because he's still an assister at the end of the day but he's an assist who's also on set pieces on penalties yeah so overall package is good it is a good package and the team in theory is meant to be challenging for top four so meant to be a strong team so all that together we're a team that can that creates 1.5 2xg game and we are not a team that exceeds our XG so we are one goal one and a half goal team a game and So within that it's just hard to justify spending 8 and a half million when you can spend 7 and a half million on a Bowen or a 6.9 million on an eer so that's where I always struggle like if you're thinking of having a a porro yeah plus a Bruno get a trend and an EIT same price yeah I agree yeah it's hard to I want to do count I can't I re I really really can't and the last thing actually before we we jump off as well and I know we're talking a little bit more about next week's wild card but um brenford Defenders have we considered I think they're okay like playing them in the absolute really good fixtures like West Ham home wolves home IP switch home the three six seven and N yeah they're okay and they rotate well with dunk because um you know when um actually dunk fishes become much later better but they can also rotate well with your your Fulham guy like if you have Ana or somebody you can play them for the Fulham Home Crystal Palace home game so I think it's okay like it's okay to have a brenford and a Brighton defender or brenford and a villa Defender like some boring I generally tend to have two big hitters like good Defenders who you can rely on and then another two who you can rotate or be safe I don't want to be worrying about those so those will be my dunks my conas my pinu you know the boring picks not my Rico lewises not my but that's the way I do it that makes sense and I think that's a perfect time to not because I don't want to go into too much discussion for next week's one because next week going to be it's going to be yeah it's going to be incredible both of us activating after this game week let me um I can't remember if there's anything else we want to chat for you I think we've already discussed this so we're good to go on that note PR I'm going to say thank you very much and wish you good luck hope your captain delivers but not too much well wish you all good luck as well and yeah um do like uh the the video if you if you do find this useful we're trying to grow this again because uh you know it's it's a it's a new pairing it's

burning questions scoutcast and all the other good stuff perfect thank you very much PR on that note I'll see you you next week my friend see you all [Music] [Applause],8932,hi everyone welcome to deadline dilemas the show where prz and i take you through our teams hopefully covering our dilemas and your dilemmas at the same time pr how you doing im doing very well nice intro youre getting into the swing of things im trying im trying every week i learn something from you the thing is so when i used to do this with flapjack last used to stream it live on thursday this time now i always worry that because we upload it by friday then news conferences and this week its going to be so much dependent on what we hear in the press conferences well try to keep it scenario based right whatever happens tomorrow we will see no totally agree a lot can change on the press conferences but im hoping i think a lot of the issues and stuff were going to discuss still going to be just as relevant tomorrow with the press conference but there will be its not an issue one small thing like now isak is fit or xiao pedro is fit it just changes like people or even confirmed out like maybe theres a new spanner theres a popular player that people own and that theyre out and then everybodys panicking so i dont want to hear that pr because as every week ive gone from ive not had one week where i thought theres even a chance of me rolling not one and this week again were going to see as we get into it which makes for good viewing as we run through our teams but every week br ive got issues and ive got dilemas to run through lets start with robs slide on just the 10 matches right let maybe thats a good place to start in terms of our view because that doesnt change regardless of the one before this so what games stand out to you apart from your beloved liverpool being the top goals expected as well as the highest clean sheet ods so the liverpool game like you said well skip that we can come back to that i think the top game versus brenford that stands out to me because brenford when i looked at their stats theyve been poor defensively they are guess why the projections are quite high there for more than two goals theyve been poor defensively theyre giving away big chances theyve had given away loads of shots on target as well so thats a good fixture which could potentially be my transfer as we discuss our teams later so that one stands out for me the other one is bo could be could be a spurs player and aston villa against wolves the chart shows like good projections for aston villa but then i watched wolves last week they werent bad against newcastle not quite sure like that ones still in my mind whether its going to deliver the two plus i think that chelsea game with wolves has peoples has taken peoples perception into something completely wrong because that chelsea wolves game i think on expected goals or xg wolves won or was it very close it was like 15 15 nothing like a 62 that no wolves got better xg thats what shocked everyone i think in that game so look im with you but i do think still home to wolves is a good game its a very good fixture what about you any other games that stand out for you well man city arsenal of course the title decider potentially and also a little bit of a spanner for a lot of teams right people with arsenal picks are debating whether to start gabrielle or people with saka debating whether they should move him onto salah and captain or just hold off and just hope for the best were were pting after arsenal have played tonight and they look toothless man like they look poor and today rice was back as well but to be fair to them though pr atlanta are a good team but are a good team and then no no man city are a ridiculously good team but you saw man city socalled harand been scoring nonstop he places he plays a serious team serious defenders and he blanks so look what im saying is its a its a fixture that is important even for fpl because people are holding on to holland people have one or two arsenal players still so well see where that goes of course my team man united theyre way to crystal palace we got battered there last season at the end of last season and so look im not optimistic on any game but the markets seem to think that were slight favorites like 165 to 155 but look i am as owner and i think you should be bullish if youre as the owner like we do still give away chances and crystal palace even though they have been leaky at the back i think theyre still good for a goal or two so i think this will be a good game something like a 21 two2 game so looking forward to that im move you on thats the game ive got highlighted for me its added interest because two of my midfielders playing that game playing each other normally id be put off by that but in this fixture im im in agreement with you i can see two perers around there thats how much goals i can see they both teams look like theyve got go in them but they can concede so that i agree with you thats one of the ones i am keeping an eye on thinking this could deliver only issue is as ive got henderson in gold but we move on we all do and we all i was having this conversation over the weekend with somebody and they were with jack f jack very good feld manager hes a very good manager chelsea manager as well isnt chelsea fan exactly chelsea fan so he was saying people just hate edison for no reason edison is a good keeper hes been good for fpl and then i was like do people like any keeper like is there one keeper that everyone says i love this keeper like think of last season people dont like we didnt like pford at times we didnt like arola when we got him we didnt like duka edison is always hated i think now everyone is converging towards liking rya which i feel is dangerous because whenever we all love somebody too much they disappoint can i be honest that worries me the same thing i was speaking to another very good manager a friend and he was saying were all excited about bringing ryer in especially after tonight in champions leagues penalty save you just watch whats going to happen isnt it like you said its almost leading up to that its almost like inevitable everyones getting excited we finally got a goalkeeper at the best defense a good price point lets just and it makes things worse because weve all had no goalkeeper returns so were desperate were looking at rya every week destroying the bonus destroying the clean sheet so were thinking we won a piece of that so i totally get you there is lingering in the back come on mind prs like how hes going to troll us he will not troll us by like arsenal wont become a bad team hell troll us in the sense that we will want a fourth arsenal and well be like weve gone r so now we cant get h or we cant get if sterling starts playing thats how hell troll us i thats how hell get us i will take that if thats the worst its going to get i will take that i was thinking more hardly and what man city do they win in threenil last two minutes and they just concede for the sake of it for shot as well how do you read the fulham newcastle game because fulham have been doing fairly well last week i didnt expect them to be winning one nil against west ham until the 95th minute unlucky this week newcastle who havent been amazing but keep winning they have the same number of points as what arsenal so how do you read that game very tricky game ful are been better than i expected this season per thats to answer your point fulam definitely doing well the for unfortunate last game week newcastle i said it in last weeks deadline dilemma theyre doing the thing which all top teams do and theyve done it again against wolves because they werent great of course they were hindered by isak coming off and whatnot and theyre very depleted gordon had to go up front which well discuss in more detail later but they done it again do press barnes turned up and scored that stunner shaw is he always does that once or twice a season in random 30 yards top corners so so this game here there could be goals in this as well no clean sheets in that game thats for sure theres going to be goals in that press two one to one of them i cant read its got newcastle i think slight favorites but could go either way could go either way this is to me its a draw like its a one all one all maybe 22 or 21 game something like that but look i sometimes we say you have this championship form you make results work you score two outside the goal outside of the goal bangers you also got a bit lucky right those are very low xg chances and those are chances that sometimes go in sometimes dont go in i think newcastle have been a bit lucky they have been lucky where theyve ended up with the number of points theyve got theyve been completely rubish like even in the league cup game that they lost to forest i think was it they were rubbish so fine they can keep getting results but they have zero interest from me after this week in fpl terms and af still got trip on newcastle just to i hate them because from my game b one team everything is perfect apart from the three bloody newcastle players i picked those are the three transfers that might end under delivered but isaac you could argue hes close in four game weeks he delivered twice isnt he thats not too bad he had to deliver last week because people sold him last week when like salah delivered from me when nobody had him when last week everybody got him i was like no worries sal it doesnt matter i totally agree and especially for me do how so went into the last game week very optimistic until then everyone was having a shocker no problem but i still had two players in the bag in the last game week i had gordon and i had isac so you can imagine p im watching that game of im im a proper newcastle fan now fully like a jordy and honestly when i saw gordon go through he dinked past the two defenders this in the first 10 minutes he went through and he smashed it and it went hit crossbar i was like this we could be in something here little did that would be his best chance and then isach would come off so i just after that to be honest i just turned off the tv and i was like su out this game week same all right so thats thats for the week i think well refer to the roby slide on the players when we talk about our own teams and our trans transfer decisions so you want to start with yours well go back to our to lets go to our teams lets lets talk about where you are what are you planning whens your wild right here we go so wild card pr i was close to going this week but ive managed to hold off to next week which is good so for me i didnt have a plan you was for example rigid game week six from the get goal which is which is cool i wasnt as well planned as you ive had it in the bag waiting for emergencies and im im im there now im honestly i think im there so next weeks a perfect time table i didnt want to go this week because of the arsenal brenford for the similar reasons i think youve spoken about before as well so this week i line up with henderson in goal hopefully the last week if our wild card then stays in there that would be special but anyway no chance even if he gets a 15p pointer against man united hes not st stranger things have happened pres but so henderson in gold trent thirst defend and currently you can see the captain on him yes i just noticed that okay the captain see were going to come back into that a bit more detail let me finish the rest hes got a gorgeous fixture born with at home very good performance against ac milan midweek they we conceded straight away but we didnt moan or sal and know we turned it because it could have easily been the narrative we forest all of a sudden were losing were going to crumble in fact one of my friends messaged me straight after that saying look youre crumbling already i was like give it give it tag but anyway so trent and then beside him ive got robinson and ive got consa so thats the back four back three in the goalkeeper right there in midfield ive got jot bruno fernandez e and gordon so not too bad there up front currently still got pedrol starting i think i would prefer him to smith r whos my first bench you came on for us last week and saved us so yes absolutely it was gorgeous wasnt it honestly absolute legend but ive still ive still been ruthless and started pedro ahead of him who pedrol started to train yesterday which was that wednesday and hes got what two more three more days he should be back realistically hopefully harand whos got the most difficult fixture arsenal and then ive got isach whos got the went from a eye problem to a nose problem to a toe problem now hes ticked boxes hes flagged as well so you could see and my bench is u same i havent made no transfers yet so matthews in goal backup goalkeeper then smith roll howood and hall he makes up my triple newcastle so thats the team press what im thinking at the moment looking at this team so ive got the two yellow flag players isaak being the bigger concern more theres more money in him you have one free transfer one free transfer ive got 19m in the bank now exact watkins easy thats thats an easy move that is exactly the easy move hence why when you were speaking about the fixtures earlier on and the projected goals and points i went straight for the villa one because thats the one im highlighting right i did try to consider remember last week pr you pointed out one which is again its from a good fixture and that would be bruno to son and but spurs have been a bit you saw them against centry midweek they just about won and spurs are do opposite to newcastle if sean glimps is of good football but theyre losing every game which is not ideal and son has not been that great hes numbers are not been that great on the left i hear you its put me off he would be a lovely thats a big punt that is because the fixture is perfect i think its a good fixture and its a good fixture but they would play five at the back so i dont know if that suits him playing off the left the thing is solanki played well against arsenal but then in the kaba cup didnt play well i didnt think in the first half but then he was playing with other random people right say its hard to judge him on that so look i think its still a good fixture and i think son is a decent captain this week so if you wanted to do it but then bruno isnt bad either like we just talked about it so i think its almost and if im so were going to presumption my wild card in next week so i can do any transfer of course as long as i can afford it and dont worry about the repercussions so the son one i did try to think is it viable but im getting rid of son sorry im getting rid of bruno and ive potentially still got two yellow flag players with a weak bench so thats not ideal the only other transfer so lets just say the watkins one is the favorite move its a straightforward one the only other one that makes sense to me as well is the liverpool fixture against bournemouth is lovely as well liverpool after the m theyre going to want redemption from that notam forest game if i get early news i could wait for diaz i could go to gordon and to diaz but that would only be useful if i knew isak was fit otherwise his point if that makes sense presa could you do robinson to robo could do that thats a to be honest but the week before the week before a wild card id want it to be an attacking not saying the robo one couldnt be at least robo got rested midweek so i like that you have 19 in the bank right so you could do hall to robinson robertson so that would give you a fourth it would give you a bench in case isack and pedro miss out you could just something to think about like something to think about or g starting jaia pedro to but you need so okay to add another layer to it pr the player coming in ideally would want to be a captain dont think ive got trent captaincy because its my favorite i never normally captain defenders even an elite player captain highland whats the problem captain no nothing but well you say that you saw harl against inter hes gonna play against arsenal theyre going to deliver the same theyre gonna of course he can of course he can score press but hes going to do this he going to play against gabrielle and celba theyre going to be what rice and front of him theyre going to be on him they will they will no denying that it seems like he im not saying hes not going to score but one like max where potentially you dont think so would you prefer so in my position you would never captain someone like trent pr is that way too look i think if the if the game was against southampton or leicester or bournemouth is like a midtable team and bmar an attacking team so the clean sheet odds like if you can see its 40 40 is okay like if i if i get to 50 type odds and i look for an attacking defender i can look for a defender captain but 40 clean sheet odds and relying on an attacking return im not there yet completely like i would say harland is better ill be honest i never c captain defenders very rare i normally im not scared to do like punts in captaincy ive done it many times i was looking at maybe even ezza or bruno then im thinking maybe the player i bring in pr the captaincy so someone like watkins comes in i just make him captain see watkins captain is good but if he plays 60 minutes hes the same as holland in my view if he plays 60 minutes if he plays but i dont think surely thats going to change now like they done it against young boys midweek on the astral turf and he had a little bit ice pack but surely they ramp up the minutes now for him after that everton performance how long can that continue that phased return in how i get it but you have to also see that this other dude is playing so well duran that its sometimes its just done out of necessity like he doesnt want to play two strikers and he wants to give minutes to duran as well maybe someone like rogers could drop out for him potentially could do that maybe im just thinking im trying to its i agree hes going to have to look after watkins its a long season theyre in champions league we know how united emory is of european football so im in agreement he will do he wont like put it far down on the priority list so im here with you on that does put me off but then it puts me back in a predicament who do i bring in because ideally i want to bring in a captain so i am i am stuck here theres not much options for me well you could do jao pedro to sanii or gakpo thats thats the one i was that did come to my mind as spurs player so we spoke about son earlier on i did think sank i think the reason ive not mentioned him because i started a season of him so i think ive got a bit of a got i need to remove that resentment i need to remove it because thats possibly if you still held him you wont have lost any value in him thats what i could a bit like barco he didnt drop that annoyed me that did though price cuz i sold every other player that was destroying me financially i sold every one of them and hes the one hes the one i thought i checked it once one of the evenings that hes going down i thought what let me take care of him but anyway to be fair in hindsight it worked out because i b pedro in against arsenal so yes it did so you should like s salanki look i think i think my advice to you would be to separate captaincy and good transfer decision like captaincy for me harland sets you a baseline in terms of that anything i think after salah anything is harand or harand level so then you shouldnt be hunting for captain you should be fixing the weakest point in your team and i think the weakest point in your team is maybe that robinson slot because this week look i expect newcastle to score so only one week though pr if im wild carding game week six why do you need to be so concerned about fixing the week so you mean the we point for this game you mean for this game week you mean just chas some points so thats what the weakest point this week and that weakest point could be an injured player it could be isach whos injured then you get you could get watkins if its jao pedros injured you could just chuck it and say ill just play smith so im just saying you could also save your transfer and roll it through the wild card which is a new luxury that we have in life and so we should enjoy that in life the only thing we the only reason ill do that pr is if i got the all clear say press conferences on the friday that xiao pedro and isach because i am on i as you could see on my bench i am in trouble getting closer to using hall harwood and you dont want to be in that position so you should you should be okay like having one very good like last week it paid off like having paid off a good first sub you have a good first sub and if somebodys out you have one transfer so i think you look okay to be honest to me now the problem is if theres a leak that j isnt starting what you going to do then im gonna have to thats a problem to be honest js becoming a problem anyways most be the last week for him in my team i dont know about you pr we talk about that more but if i get the news that hes out i could go for a direct replacement go straight for diaz o gakpo one of them i do think he starts but just like you said if the news comes out liverpools the early kickoff so we could get the information not early its at 3 pm but we should at 3 pm sorry but we might still get early information on the on team news that js going to be rested this week but i be surprised i think hell start what do you think about the one i said to you earlier on then you didnt comment that much on you didnt like it gordon to diaz if diaz is star say you get the team leaked that no youre not feeling that because gordon is going to start hes healthy hes got fulham playing maybe be playing up front like i dont see hes not a weak link in this team the weak links are a rotation risk jot if hes not starting a injury injured xiao pedro or could be fit its still a concern an injured is or a robinson i think those are the four areas where im trying to help this team with one we puns i think youre right there maybe because i just i dont know i thought sometimes i look at it as well this is a good game week to try and bring if you havent got salah youre on the ropes for captaincy this game week you are youre youre on the ropes a little bit i think theyre real tricky so i thought maybe this is the weaker i could get someone in that could do something i dont know maybe san is the news who do you prefer out of san and watkins cuz i can afford both go to rob ts chart next one there you go theres your answer its very close so watkins 56 and solanki 0 51 now keep in mind this assumes that they all play the full game thats the key so watkins not playing the full game i think its bang on the same as a pedro or a salanki or even a jot look theyre all 051 so i would say yes theyre all 051 its too close between all of them captain the guy whos going to play 90 minutes and has a 069 per goals who everyone is else is not going to captain dont have a fundamental issue like people will tell you andy martin will tweet if youre captaining holland you wear socks in bed or whatever but it if hes the second best captain hes the second best captain should you have planned to get salah a little bit if you werent unlucky with injuries yes fine to goand i would have been with salah i would have 100 been there but unfortunately every week has been like weve discussed and ive been given us true to true to the show dilemma every week but looking at this it shows you how good isach is still an option if he is fit look exactly theres no need to take out isack if hes okay if i see him in the training pictures im not selling him okay so youre look ive got ive got more confusion in my head now prin this is this is the idea of deadline dilemas we dont solve confusion i thought incre your problems i wanted to speak to you so you could decrease them ive got more issues now im more con i have eliminated for you gordon to diaz so i have helped you i have eliminated for you a fit esack to watkins that one definitely i wouldnt i agree im im with you on that even without checking the chart i think you remember last week how high i was on isach i didnt expect that it wasnt the first half wasnt great but i didnt expect him to come off that early if he plays on hes also been unlucky i do agree hes been unlucky hes got a goal and assist even though in one match he has only played 45 minutes and the other one they lost a player in the first half i exactly that so look he has been unlucky yes so overall ive got go back to my team i think just to finish off on my team like ive got im no clearer im going to see tonight see tomorrow more information tomorrow and maybe even im not value now i dont care about it so im going to wait till the last minute press for the move value is the least of my concern ive way past that my team is on sale ive leaked a lot of value everywhere pr so cool all right so we go to my team lets have a look at yours so its not too different from yours apart from salah being there instead of brun apart from salah being there no but like you i have henderson in goal as well i have trent as well i have got kza did you have kza mh you have kza so instead of your robinson i have dunk which is which is nice dunk got me a clean sheet last week and i prefer his fixture this week to robinson so okay ill play him again but its not like this is not a robertson its just dunk so and then and then in midfield again i have jot as well i have e as well so instead of mosalah and instead of bruno i have salah and instead of your gordon i have rogers and thats it because the front line is also the same its isak jao pedro and holland so its not too different but i also have two free transfers and i have 05m in the bank so simple esac to watkins if isak is out so thats the plan okay but i i w captain watkins i still captain salah but i think its worth it like lets say jao pedros fit jot is starting then you could also say just start smith row instead of esack and just go there but i think its worth it if he if isach is not playing with those with that fixture i think im happy to chance it and go watkins so ill use one of my free transfers but my hope is that isack is fine and in that case if jot is also starting then i will save a free transfer because then i will roll it again and ill take three free transfers to my wild card and then enjoy life after wild card so thats that would be the plan because if ja out ill just play mythro instead i dont think thats thats a huge that wont you wont bother with a transfer for that and if an unforeseen injury happens somewhere like a u while people what is it the warmup injury before the lineup then robinson comes on so its not like i have a terrible second sub either its pretty decent your second sub im starting him so it shows youre a little bit more healthier from in that position and youve got salah so transfer wise you seem pretty settled wares confuses me if isaks fit he stays and if pedro stays injured youll just play smith roll yes correct so youd roll two transfers if both of them are fit okay youre in a good position so theres a scenario in which i do two transfers and that scenario is if isach is confirmed out and jot is also not starting okay so if isak is confirmed out i will do watkins like immediately but then lets say 15 minutes deadline before deadline j is not starting then i could do j to diaz or i could do xiao pedro to vardy or dcl i think both of both those options are open i couldnt do j to diaz because diaz has gone up hes gone up hes 77 isnt he so i cant do because if i use esack to watkins ive used up my 05 your budget so my only option will be j to vard or dcl which i think im fine with im happy with the a vardi a v party last time its a onewe pun isnt it so its its not too bad i like would ben and just start smith in that case that would be the plan team looks good captaincy is the one for you so youve been sol 100 youve planned it for this for this game youve got sol in your team youve sold harand to be quite a bit even though hes playing arsenal shunk team youve not had any doubts even though hes been scoring hes my vice captain hes your vice captain if moala gets a warmup injury i am happy to have holland as my captain like i dont think theres a better captain that i own at the moment i think watkins could be slightly better or if similar it again comes down to your minutes expectation i dont have a spurs attacker who could be similar i dont have palmer who could be similar so i think its that bracket like i think okay maybe trent is also in that bracket you could argue but i want to see clean sheet odds better than 40 for me to go trend which is look were on game week five now press ive not seen many clean sheets higher than 40 the odds theyre pretty theyre pretty tight at the moment trying to get clean she sheet in the premier league last week we had a bit more the week before we only had liverpool corre last week there was a couple of more clean sheets but its the stats when you look at the statistically theres not many clean sheets thats the only thing thats made me consider trent and i do think weve been unlucky to not get a mega hall from him for sure for sure the guy keeps getting returns in champions league or for england not getting an attacking return for liverpool and hes come so close thereve been sitters missed by jot there was that goal that was ruled offside so look there is a there is a high ceiling with trent i do agree with you but i do also think that the floor could be just two points and while salah gets a 12 pointer and then you fall back whereas with holland i think one return you can see 62 of one return which was the market odds i like those odds like 62 of one goal versus 40 of a clean sheet for trent think of it that way because both are four points but with trent surely this is the game where the goal or assist comes press this is the game this fixture here were going to pin youre the liverpool fan im not going to stop you were going to pin b back theyre going to be pinned in their half and trents going to be on the edge of the box at times surely this is the game week thats the reason ive got it on him even im taking a look ill be honest with you pr im not 100 sol myself like i said earlier tren defender caps se how many ive been playing foo now for over what is it 18 years i cant remember how many times ive captained the defender maybe at the start when i didnt know what i was doing the reality is very rare so for you dont even need to consider thats no chance youve already got youve got salah are you not worried about salahs blank last week to for salahs blank no its fine mil i dont know if you if youve caugh g of course i watched he should have scored two goals did he the ball was it hit under the barall press and bounced back out very strange like so look i hope people get put off by one blank u i think salahs a great cap this week see im im im its worrying me because i know what the potential is in this game and i remember back was it about three four years ago perhaps i captained him it was a born with fixure early it was an early kickoff and he scored this sol scored three goals or four goals and assist it was it was beautiful i thought it was watford no hes done one against watford im sure its bournemouth once okay s hes done it against many teams but im sure once against bournemouth he had a massive return its fine its fine youll be fine tell me about your wild card six before we end the stream like what are your early thoughts what are you trying to think in terms of structure so ive only had one quick like play around couple of days ago and so the arsenal players so for example the first starting point was arsenal players if im totally honest with you so thats why i was looking around and rya was in all of the little permutations with gabrielle two defenders instead of two attackers and im stuck in between the attackers press so havitz versus saka the consistency the talisman plays every minute no matter how much he hobbles versus havitz whos been excellent since hes coming to the team last season and hes cheaper its what i can do with that money so thats the first starting place the free arsenal plays have you had a thought about the arsenal players pr i think i think most of us will be on double defense unfortunately like if odard was fit and you could see havs playing up top i was looking at havs but with double defense like look at how pragmatic they are with spurs tonight with atlanta it just screams for double arsenal defense you just get a gabrielle and you get a rya and you sit and enjoy points for the rest of the season and i am firmly a saka boy instead of a havard sp bo because of his positioning as well so for me my triple up is going to be pretty much unless i change from rya to a fleen and then get saliva as well but its going to be double defense plus saka i think thats where i am okay and then see that one im still not 100 sure that tells you im not youve mostly like cemented a couple of permat couple of drafts already and locked in for me no nothing is nothing one injury changes everything of course no but im still im still playing around so liverpool players i still wanted to keep some so i wanted to keep trent whos one of my favorite assets in fp this season but then the money its caused me problems i think when ive done a couple of permutations the money was causing me an issue salah was in salah wasnt in my team dont play in your wild cards none no you need dont from game week six onwards right you have crystal palace away chelsea home arsenal away brighton home aston villa home now theyve got three good home games but those are all top 10 teams like villa is a top 10 team brightons a top 10 team chelsea is a top 10 team arsenal away is the toughest fixture in the league that one you can see in game week n and then crystal palace away west and wolves away are decent but i dont think ill be caping saline even a single one out of those and so im thinking and this is going to be a little different from what youve seen is get saka holland and palmer and have that differential palmer that not a lot of people can get to especially those who are not wild carding and that could be a little edge because i think weve lost two important components coming into game week six number one is this third striker or second striker right i cant think of a good second striker now because watkins is expensive not getting the minutes esac is not great with the with the fixtures as well havs has become a less of an option soank is a question mark jackson is okay but a question mark then you come way down the two cheap strikers are still good doess so like mention you can do calbert luen you can do xiao pedro you can do vardy something like that wood is still viable wood is also okay and then in midfield i also feel like as appeal has reduced a little bit so you can make a structure with palmer saka bumo couple of maybe an or couple of cheaper mids like five and a half million and then you have a harand and two other cheap strikers and you have your rock and roll defense with rya gabrielle maybe even a porro a trend and i think thats where im trying to go so i do like okay theres something i want to speak about were going to come back to that e before we jump back onto that e now watching the clips back that didnt look like a discussion pr that looked like glasner put some nice pr there that looked like the big bully meta said give me that ball its my penalty this so its going to be interested what happens in the next penalty situation that didnt look like a discussion to if you had a discussion you talk before the game or after if you do talk near the ball its a quick one but the way they were looking at each other and then and kti had to come and stop them that told me theres no discussion there pres there i think mata is also by the way in the striker discussion mata could be interesting as well if hes going to keep the pens i think at this stage we dont know like i would say you should we should assume 5050 because e is still a a club leader a talisman in open play as well so maybe after the game theyve agreed okay you take the next one im not going to speculate on that but i think what we now know is hes not 100 on penalties maybe people knew this before i didnt but now we know hes not 100 on it and when somebodys not 100 on it and hes playing for a team that is that has lost like three out of the first four like that then it can be something that you can avoid but also if you go for him i think its fine so i think he becomes a an option which is if you go its fine if you dont go its fine a bit like jot in game big one right some people went some people didnt go it is not the end of the world for anyone so i think thats how he becomes a little bit and thats okay theres two other players you didnt mention and i want to bring them up on potential wild cards and were only were only touching base because next weeks deadline le is going to be excellent were both on wild card thats going to be thats going to be a real good one but boing you dont i know i like him as well pr and ive considered him i think i had him a couple of permutations i know the fixtures get even more juicier after game week 10 but he could be one of the players its a longterm pick you just put him in and hope hes been doing not bad hes going under the radar he is he is and i think as a midfielder i think after bumo in that price bracket i think hes up there like if youre looking at 7 and a half six and a half to seven and a half midfielders hes up there and at the moment i would say if you had the money may be better than e because of just the sheer number of good games that they have coming up and him his minutes are still up there similar to a i think hes a good pick if you can fit him in i if im trying to jam in a third premium palmer is not a premium then for me its not an option but for people who are you can bring palmer down to a bruno or even a boen and i think there are things that can open up with that i was going to ask you about ive already got him your boy bruno you is he been any permutations of your wild cards or not yet per not mine no i dont consider him its only because i like man united i like watching them and i get doubled down if my man united player is not doing well and the team is not doing well i would be happy regardless if he scores an assist or a goal im happy so its its its that one thing last season i didnt enjoy going for double man united midfielders in the beginning and i was it tilted me in terms of decision making because man united was doing poorly and my fpl team was doing poorly so im going to remove that and if people want to go for bruno i think hes fine i dont think hes the machine that people make him out to be because hes still an assister at the end of the day but hes an assist whos also on set pieces on penalties so overall package is good it is a good package and the team in theory is meant to be challenging for top four so meant to be a strong team so all that together were a team that can that creates 15 2xg game and we are not a team that exceeds our xg so we are one goal one and a half goal team a game and so within that its just hard to justify spending 8 and a half million when you can spend 7 and a half million on a bowen or a 69m on an eer so thats where i always struggle like if youre thinking of having a porro plus a bruno get a trend and an eit same price i agree its hard to i want to do count i cant i re i cant and the last thing before we jump off as well and i know were talking a little bit more about next weeks wild card but brenford defenders have we considered i think theyre okay like playing them in the absolute good fixtures like west ham home wolves home ip switch home the three six seven and n theyre okay and they rotate well with dunk because when dunk fishes become much later better but they can also rotate well with your fulham guy like if you have ana or somebody you can play them for the fulham home crystal palace home game so i think its okay like its okay to have a brenford and a brighton defender or brenford and a villa defender like some boring i generally tend to have two big hitters like good defenders who you can rely on and then another two who you can rotate or be safe i dont want to be worrying about those so those will be my dunks my conas my pinu the boring picks not my rico lewises not my but thats the way i do it that makes sense and i think thats a perfect time to not because i dont want to go into too much discussion for next weeks one because next week going to be its going to be its going to be incredible both of us activating after this game week let me i cant remember if theres anything else we want to chat for you i think weve already discussed this so were good to go on that note pr im going to say thank you and wish you good luck hope your captain delivers but not too much well wish you all good luck as well and do like the video if you if you do find this useful were trying to grow this again because its its a its a new pairing its now published on a friday like i

from Fantasy Football Scout with myself as and someone who looks a little bit like David Dickinson a few minutes ago thanks to a really weird orange light that was like shining in her face it's Sam mfield how are you Sam I'm having a day as honestly like I don't even really know what's going on anymore I've just been at meeting at my kids school Panic driven as quickly as possible home put the wrong light on looked like I'd been Tangoed by you were literally like I just I'll just put this light on what do you think boom like orange oh cuz I've got a new camera and I tweaked around with the settings on it I'm still not loving it particularly but anyway wor about that another time that's that's another problem for another day uh but this light is my favorite light I use it might be able to show you no I can't the wire's in the way um it's my favorite light I like to work by it cuz it's got a really nice there's something about the shade of the light that it gives out that's really nice for working under like it's not bright if you know what I mean apparently it makes me look really orange really orange yeah it was a bit of a shock actually when you when you turned off and put that put on was like a bad tan job or something you know imagine I got got the fancy show tomorrow imagine if I went on it like that the makeup ladies be like there's no saving yeah there's no saving yeah there we can't do anything can't fix that uh hi to everyone in the chat hi to Cameron star mentioning Spurs is narrow win against centry in the Cup yesterday hi to Eddie hi to Karim Tia hi to British 87 hi to flaty boy who says after no questions for me no sub needed off the wild card last week looking forward to seeing what questions are being asked uh today Ian Smith say wouldn't be a live stream if one of them wasn't late your fault today no let's not let's not because I actually was here exactly on the right time and you sent me a load of links that didn't work yeah actually that's a good point although no well you you bet be at 17 pass saying the link didn't work that's well I was here I was here at 13 past okay and then and then I to call you to say I can't 13 past is pushing it though for a quarter past stream I'm have you met me my me my meeting did not finish until 4: and then I had to get from their school and get two kids from another room where they were being babysat while I did this meeting and then get home in the excuses to me same and I haven't got a cup of tea and I'm too hot so it's a lot going on and you've been Tangoed and I know you you said just you put your sunglasses on before we came on as well and then was like what am I doing it's been a weird start to this uh Mark Southern is in the chat with his weird little purple emoji thing blowing bubble gum that I I don't know it's how I know it's actually him though cuz no one else would have that uh he says still got barcat I want to swap for another Brighton Defender but heard they're getting smashed this week what should I do he's convinced that that Forest are going to do a number on on Brighton I'm I'm the opposite I think bright are going to win this what do you think brighty Forest excited can I get you and Mark in a room while this is happening what the game yeah can I be in a room with you two when this is happening we haven't been to see a game yet we keep talking about going up to the city ground or to the MX but we haven't actually arranged it yet um but yeah he's he's very adamant that Forest are going to win this this one um what's your prediction do you think um n nil oh god really no I've gotone in in my sleeper pick and I've gone for a draw because I genuinely I genuinely think that it's going to be nil nil that is sitting on the fence to a to a new level I don't want to upset either of the black bo boys no that's very true yeah that's very true good point um if you are good if this I mean this isn't a serious question because it's from Mark and I don't think he care less about what what I think about bright defends but if you are going to get a bright Defender I think you could be making a case for a certain Turkish leftish rightish back in kadogo scored in the Cup yesterday I think he probably starts might need a few more weeks just to make sure he's actually naed in the team but one to watch I think he looks looks good I like him prob go on loan next now I've said that generational tent shut up spaghetti uh replace munes or should I bench him and play seeno um I'm replacing Min this week I think I'm taking a hit this I think might Tak a hit you out just go for it replace my whole front line who who you getting do you want to give a bit more um more or you keeping your cards close to your chest no no uh it's a little bit TBC still because we're going to see what presses what Joy presses brings tomorrow um but I'm my current thinking is Watkins and dap dap I like that I am fully fully invested in Liam deap so is that is that esack and uh to Watkins andap and but that just allows me to keep all my budget that I've got in the bank in the bank because I'm basically taking the five from Min KN and putting it on putting it on esack yeah would you would you played that this week yeah yeah Southampton he looks good he looks good to La it's just the minutes he got subbed early against Brian I don't really know why he looked he looked really good against against us just not sure he's fully fully fit yet but they need him I think I think so I like him I I'm just decided you know you know like I get like this don't I and I just get fully invested in one player and that's it he is the man at the moment okay obsessed yeah no but you know what I'm not going to give you any any stick about it because I actually quite like him as well I was talking about him on Black Box last night I think he could he could get 10 goals I think for switches this season 5.5 good value when you went here last week I I went rogue I just was as I do did you watch it back I just spent the whole time talking about how much I like tip switch and how I thought that they were going to get uh six clean sheets before game week 16 and then they went and then they went and got one against you five more and I was like so I basically taking that as gospel that I now know everything about and you're not buying a Defender you're buying there the striker oh I want a Defender as well that'll be next week I'll buy a Defender yep uh Peta says deap is the new Pooky y could be I mean you were obsessed with Pooky a few seasons ago as well he really bought P didn't I yeah I forgot about that I did yeah you're right Eddie says prefer deap to as his M's favorite mcin yeah MC's MC's not really a favorite anymore she's gone off him she saw him getting a bit Larry so she she took him out of the team and he's pretty much dead to her now honestly it's very fickle in in this house with with things like that uh kareim says thinking of Trent as Captain this week I have Robo and J Trent Captain versus Bournemouth I think Bournemouth score do you I don't I'm thinking about TR Trent as Captain you about say Trotter we about to combine Trent and J as yeah Trot I got like that as a double up I'm on the Trotter double up that is my double up that's the double up I've got just throw my stress bone on the floor um have you not got sellah no okay and if Watkins is fair then I'll have Watkins uh and then I'll probably Captain him but I am thinking about Tren as Captain I don't think it's a terrible idea idea I think his underly numbers are obviously good I think there's a clean sheet like Bournemouth they were good against Chelsea and they didn't stve to lose the game against Chelsea but equally I didn't think they were that great going forward and I don't know that I see them scoring against that Liverpool defense so I think there's a clean sheet there again for Liverpool and it Trent's only got to get the clean sheet and one attack in return and you're in a double digit Hall and I'd like to captain on that but I don't think it's terrible this week he got a big hole against Bournemouth was it last season well maybe the season before when was the big they got 9 N didn't they that was the nine two years ago now was it Salah didn't return in that at all Trent scored I think in that game yeah and nothing for Sala yeah yeah it's two years ago that wasn't last season two yeah um yeah no I I don't I don't mind it Trent got two assists last night didn't they um no not last night the night before for for van djk and canate yeah don't hate it I think if you don't have Salah he's he's as good as anyone it's probably for me it's probably salot toop um and then I'd even put Harland in just because it's Harland Harland Watkins probably is second and then anyone else is probably a bit of a punt um but good week to have a punt because the captain is going to be split exactly y uh oh Cameron Stars someone we talked about Black Box last night Sharda for a budget midfielder 5.4 million I think he is likely to play up front with uh Visa out he paid came on for him didn't he I think he plays up front there is a slight Wonder in my mind as to whether he plays car valo and then puts some bomo but there are other he has got other options but we have seen brenford play since in the League Cup uh I think Sher is a nice differential Spurs defense is well woeful uh wow har it is like I mean if anyone sits here and says anything other than that then I thought you defended all right against against Arsenal just just not from set pieces obviously which is just continues to be a problem that's the problem though isn't it is that do you know what weirdly we actually weren't terrible from most set pieces like there were a number of set pieces that Arsenal took where we actually defended fine and then there's just a couple that if you get it right and then it can be exploited now brentford's I think brenford score against us they always score against us that's just you know how it is um so B on Spurs clean sheet and I think as a budget as budgets go there may be some rotation with him if if Frank decides to use different assistance because he does have the Personnel to do something slightly different but with Visa out for two months there should be plenty of game time for sharder and therefore I don't think it's a terrible idea at all no nor do I I I quite like it it's I think you want another week ideally because that's when the really good fixtures start and then we might know a bit more about how they're going to line up without without v um so I think wait if you can I don't think there's going to be too many wild cards this week given the Arsenal and City play each other but I think there's going to be a million wild cards played in game week six probably maybe even more than that and I think it's going to be very very popular in the in the F Community as well are you are you going to be wild carding in six no no holding it do you know when you're thinking of using it 12 14 16 something like that so L much later late much later the thing is I've got double Arsenal already I can easily make it trouble like I'm not feeling like my team I actually think that my team isn't far weirdly it's not far away from the team that most people wild card too like I can get Triple Arsenal and and bomo next week relative well easily so yeah I'm not I'm not planning to Wild Card the only issue is that obviously a lot of people will and therefore you know a risk of price changes and that kind of stuff but equally if you wild card it doesn't affect the price changes anyway so the more people that are on it the less chance there is of that being an issue to me yeah not true uh alapo uh Trent got one assist Sima got the van Van Dyke assist there you go only one assist but still um like you say if they can get a clean she against Bourn he gets a an assist he's he's on for double digits isn't he 12 13 points probably so yeah decent decent option uh farz says should I start face or Gabrielle neither of them are clean sheet so Gabrielle yeah I don't think it's worth backing Leicester defense over someone with as much attacking threat as as Gabrielle from set pieces also I think that game could be nil nil that's the prediction I've gone for in that City Arsenal neither team want to lose I think he's got draw written all over it is it a scor or is it a nil nil yeah I don't disagree with you I'd play Gabrielle uh fenor says Lee is right about an he'll be gone off this season Lee said that an is got one more season left did he Lee and I nearly got divorced on Sunday on the middle of our live stream cuz he was being a total uh he was basically just trying to W me up and Le I can't imagine that oh as I wish I'd married you at that point on Sunday honestly I was like what is my life how how am I sitting here having just cuz I've been to the north London Derby as well so having just got home from that to then have to sit there and listen to him spout a load of absolute Tosh just to just to wre me up I was I'm done with you and they've lost to bloody Forest as well and I said nothing rude about slot and you know Liverpool and all of that nothing he was a disgrace uh I don't think he's right I think he's completely wrong I wasn't very impressed with po GL in the post match I will on Sunday he comes across very I don't he doesn't come across well in interviews anymore I don't know what's happened to him in the last year he was so he just gets fed up with being asked the same stupid questions over and over and over again like do do not think like when you think about what he was being asked at the beginning when he first died it was all like quite positive and stuff like that because we started the season well last year then we had all those injuries and then every week they asked him the same questions why aren't you good from set pieces well we've got a loan of injuries and these players are out why have we why have we not got this we can't buy anyone to replace these players I'm having to play players out position and it was the same answers every week and it's like stop asking the same stupid questions and I feel like this season it started in a similar way they keep just asking him about really negative things and so because of that he then gives quite negative answers um whereas actually when when you listen to him on the like interviews that he does for like Spurs and for channels where he's not being asked stupid questions I keep throwing my stress ball on the floor um he doesn't Spurs he comes yeah he comes across really well in those in those interviews still like still the same sorts of things so I don't know I just think that the Press manipulate things to how how they want to be okay well I I don't want to you know ruin you know this this nice Q&A Atmosphere by going in on on spur so I'm going to I'm going to take your word I'm going to take your word for it uh everyone everyone's everyone's saying everyone's talking about Lee in your argument now so I can't take any of those any of those questions let like a nice one about Sanchez Rob Sanchez he's nice and safe what you think of Rob Sanchez do you trust the cha defense no like I I appreciate that he got a haul in game week four what a performance from Sanchez bloody H right he played incredibly well and he saved a penalty so deserves the hall but aside from that hole I've not seen anything from him that would suggest that he was worth it and there's still the fact that they've signed this other goalkeeper and at some point I was kind of expecting him to start in one of these games so I think if you are I don't I don't want to be this I feel like I'm Ipswich is like number one cheerleader at the moment but genuinely if I was going for 4.5 right now I'd still go for miric which is what I said last week my God you really are on the switch train last week I tractor last week I said I'd go for um I'd go for mck and I still would if you don't want to be on it switch um and you've still only got 4.5 then fleen would be my choice over Sanchez it's always when you look at goalkeepers and you see sort of 212 and then a massive Hall of 15 uh you know seven saves uh you know saved the penalty as well but Bournemouth scor that penalty and he's getting two points again or three points um and it was a good save and he made a load of great saves but you've always got to think they're lucky to to save a penalty you know penalty is down to a combination of things but you'd back the attacker in you'd back the penalty taken the majority of of times so okay he saved the penalty but if that goes in he's getting another blank essentially um and then no one's talking about him yeah at all so unless you think Chelsea are a good defensive side who are going to keep clean sheets and obviously with goalkeepers clean sheets have always been important they are essential now because goalkeepers do not get bonus if they don't keep clean sheets no so I'm looking at those fixes West Ham away Brighton Forest Liverpool Newcastle man united Arsenal realan in there at all realistically how many keep that none they got like he's coming up against Bowen this weekend at West Ham don't see a clean sheet there you lot can't see a clean sheet there like you're you're like by by then J Pedro back surely I I don't see it I just I don't think there's any clean sheets for Chelsea like I I don't I think def if you want to go for a Chelsea attacker then go for it but I just wouldn't touch the defense including the goalkeeper I think you if you go for Sanchez you'll feel how I feel about Henderson yeah disappointed and sad that's how I feel about him yeah must try harder you see he uh he got as many point uh reyya got as many points as Henderson has all season in one game yeah good yeah that made me feel disgraceful when I heard you say that one off the bench I was like what is my life that I've got this Palace goalkeeper what yeah my scene's going all right but that was that was a bad decision Cameron star says as I have Sanchez and ver Bren I got it wrong last week what's your opinion I mean I don't think you got it wrong you got it wrong with the outcome but I you you I would definitely have played the Brogan at home to whip switch in in that match and like I said if if that penalty go in then it's for br who gets the bigger the bigger Hall so I wouldn't worry about it out of out of those two if they got similar fixures I'd play for Bren I think we're a better defensive team uh than Chelsea um I guess you just rotate in and out based on the fixures so this week you play this week you play the Bren home to Forest next week you probably play Sanchez we're playing each other uh then Brighton are on a bit of a bad run so then you play Sanchez again I don't know it's it's not a too bad combination but when you've got two four FS there's going to be weeks when there's points on the bench I hate rotating goalkeepers don't you yeah I do too I just wish I'd spent the five on on rare at the 5.5 on rare at the beginning oh so do I so it annoys me so much that I didn't do that but we are where we are yep there's quite a few questions on esack uh Edwin says should I sell isack for gimenez or vardy um I saw another question from Brian says what to do with esack as well I sold him last week I was um another one from MIM just come in is Replacements if you're not well cut in game six I sold him last week I went into wolves absolutely terrified that he would haul went off at halim feel like I really got away with that I guess if he's if if if if I mean it's not going to happen but let's say in a crazy twist of fate hell comes out tomorrow and actually gives us some useful team news about isach and he says he's fit he's fine he'll definitely start against Fulham would that put you off selling him well there's apparently multiple problems with eack Now isn't there there's this I've got an eye issue that I picked up in the last game and now I've got a toe issue have you seen the picture of is a pirate yeah with an eye patch and a peg leg so I mean he's got he's got multiple problems um I nearly said I nearly Nam that song you know I've got 19 probably J never mind um so D with the kid Sam that song that came out about 30 years ago as I've not been down with the kids ever probably um what was the question isach um I've got isach I am planning to wait until how speaks tomorrow in the hope that he says something vaguely useful but I don't think he will and the thing is next week I would sell him anyway so really but you'd be looking at selling him for a hit right well so I could just do that one move I could just do isack to Watkins oh okay you don't need the money from Mo toap three million in the bank something stupid so should we doing moon is to deap for a hit yeah that seems that seems a bit unnecessary doesn't it I thought you needed the money to dock up no I don't need the money God I've just got dap hype you've lost your mind it's possibly true it's possibly true uh yeah I don't need the money so I can just go isack to um yeah do that to what kinson be done with it do yeah but I just don't want Moone in anymore either because the thing is what's going to happen next week is that I will want to get in bomo yeah so then next week I'll be dealing with that plus I might take another minus four next week to deal with the goalkeeper so at that point then Mo you said your team was fine a minute ago well it's only Mo isach and um hendo that I want to get rid of three and so I can deal with one this week or two this week and then the other one next week but the thing is that I don't like I just feel like if I don't get rid of M this week and I just do isack then next week rolls in I get a bomo and I get ryer or maybe I'll wait one more week and I get ryer because I think Palace have got Everton yeah so maybe I could wait one more week and get r but then basically means that munise is then getting a stay of execution like every week but I don't really want him so might as well just get rid but then the other flip of this is the in my spurs delusional mind salanki might salanki might suddenly to be decide to be Peak salanki again start you know playing like last season and if that happens I don't really want the lap and I I've taken a hit to just see this is what as I told you before this stream you're overing aren't you I'm not all right I don't think I'm all right at the minute I think I'm a bit all over the place and there's a there's been a lot going on this week and I think my brain has turned a little bit mushy what is likely to happen here is that I just do esack to Watkins and in answer to your original question that what was that don't know about you've gone on such a tangent I can't even remember what it was something about what should we do about esack should we and we said about waiting on the presser but I think he's got so many injury problems he's probably not going to play I think if you can afford to go straight from eack to Watkins that's the move y it's if you can't afford to go straight what do you do that's the bigger issue because I think you can come down and you can come down quite a lot and if you come down a lot then there's there's options like you've got Welbeck you've got dap you've got um Jamie vardy if you fancy a Pary this weekend uh you've even got Cal Le in if you can't going absolutely mental uh so there's there's four options there but if you that like in that middle bracket nobody's really performing or if they are they don't have the best fixture so like we've got salanki who's about to have a really nice fixture on but isn't performing yet because Spurs you know my my plan transfer this week um before game week four was you're GNA say Mata to salanki oh that's not what I thought you going to say yeah yeah so my plan this week was to go e act to Watkins and Mooney's to visa and then he got injured yeah out for two months so then I'm like I've got to deal with it amazing how quickly things things changed because I I I thought you know mateta blanked in the games i' own him for e on penalties well you're not saying mateta now surely no exactly I think mata's a good pick I'd put MATA in that bracket of someone that you can consider if if you're getting rid of e that like but I think that like six and a half to basically to havs is quite difficult to pick from because you've either got mateta who up until last week wasn't really showing anything but then last week suddenly we understand that he's sharing the penalty responsibility which we didn't think he had like we didn't think he had because I thought that was e uh but now he looks like a hold you've got Visa who I was that was my plan I was like this is perfect it means I don't have to get EMB bomo straight away because I can have him and then I can double up after Spurs perfect then he gets injured soank comes back and I was like okay if I see something against Arsenal or in the League Cup against centry then I'll go there because actually a low-key Spurs fixtures are great after brenford including brenford to be honest but you know they're going under the radar because we're so terrible at the minute um but I think the problem with sank is I haven't yet seen it now I was at the North Lon Derby he played really well sanke he was a menace he was in all the right places he was doing all the right things we created nothing Y and that's a problem right so I personally I'm going to wait one more week cuz I think he needs to hit the ground running it needs to be a goal once a goal comes for sank I feel like things will improve for him but I'm going to wait another week on that Havoc I don't think I think he's a good option but we're backing that cycle of well tonight that're Arsenal playing in the Champions League so weird isn't it to have champions league on a Thursday yeah I don't like it it's a bit odd have he's in the league table as well it's like absolute mess it's and it reminds me of like the super cup stuff that we didn't want like this league now but anyway I I don't actually mind the idea that you know Villa won't play young boys again cuz who really cares they played them once they were at home they gave them a chance they done them over 3-0 whatever it was and now they can move on to other games like it was it was a little bit stale that whole let's play Home and Away in all the group stages it's the same three teams I do kind of like the idea that they play different different clubs but I don't like the big league table I think that's ridiculous um it's just a bit to me I just love the Champions League like H like I I get what you're saying about maybe it's a bit St but I just think it's an it's just I loved it and it feels a bit weird at the minute like we'll see as as time goes on as to whether whether it improves and and what have you but yeah I mean so Arsenal playing tonight erard obviously now this is a bigger problem than we like last week we didn't really understand what it was and we were saying that he was rumored to be being out for 3 weeks now it looks like it's actually going to be more more than 3 weeks now against Spurs we got some insight I think but that Insight was sort of a little bit tampered by rice also not being there whereas I think at the weekend and tonight we might get more of an insight into where's H's playing yep as we also saw um oh my kid school is calling me don't take it you go take it I can I can can I mute you for a minute yeah yeah I can carry on I'll take some other questions all right I'll be back in two seconds I'll stay here you can see me but I'll myself we'll see we'll see from we'll try and work out from Sam's reaction what uh what's happening with the kids uh is it good news or is it it's never it's never good news is it when the scorings hopefully it's uh hopefully it's fine uh big tips e has lost his M get for me with no pens I'm all about inuma at that price point yeah I think I was e was the player I was most worried about I think going into into this week um and you know if you'd offered me the the switch from mateta to E I would have taken it 100 times out of 100 and Mata stting up stepping up taking the second penalty is you know one of those one of those Great Moments you have in FPL which you're just completely not expecting um I don't think e is a problem for people who've got him I still think he's a good he's a good pick but I would be prioritizing mumo over over e now now he's lost pens um for sure EP onions school is telling Sam not to trip up on IP switch uh yeah especially taking taking a hit for the lap come on Sam if you're listening if you can hear me maybe it's going to go in subliminally but yeah don't don't do that uh got mentioning about the format yeah know what people think about the new Champions League format um too many games this new Champions League I don't like it so far but we will see yeah I you know I like I said I I think the group stages I didn't watch a lot of group stage matches you know and I I do kind of switch off a little bit from football um when when it's not the when it's not the Premier League um I don't watch any England friendlies anymore for example obviously I watch the tournaments um I watched the Champions League knockout games but group stages I've not really huge fan of um to haven't watch any the Champions League even with a new format either so but yeah like I said I think at least it gives a bit more variety um and we get to see some slightly bigger games from some of the top the top clubs but yeah it's is a lot of matches now I don't think it needed more games but yeah we'll see kind of how it how it goes fny boys a fan as a Celtic fan this is it as long as I think as long as um you know uh as long as everyone's happy as long as it's not just your Liverpool's your man cities and Your Arsenal fans happy with it if you know teams from um you know fans from teams where maybe not expected to get such a long run um in the in the in the side of happy then that's the kind of the main um the main thing um Callum Robertson this is a good question uh do you think gakpo will start over Diaz so I'm a jotter owner My worry is much more that gakpo starts over over him um I know gakpo has been used mostly on the on the left that's where slot seems to like him the most um I know there was those comments about Diaz um you know he was going to play gakpo I think it was and then he came back tired from International break so he played player who had gone off and even more done even more traveling I couldn't really understand that but it was interesting that he made that comparison with Diaz and gakpo so he clearly does want gakpo on the left gakpo played really really well in the Champions League J was really poor and that's a couple of poor games for him I wouldn't be surprised to see Diaz jotter and and cah um up front I'm I'm going to give um I'm going to give J another week um I mean as as Nikolai says gakpo isn't a striker for slot no chance I hope I hope not because I don't think Darwin's a factor so that would mean J would would probably start again but what happens if jot has another poor game against Bournemouth there's going to have to be changes and if Darwin is so phased out I wonder if even if he doesn't see him as a as a striker if he might just play him in that position um anyway so yeah no no move to me this week give J another week but yeah we'll see how it goes Rob browny agrees with that I don't I don't think subie morid is a Diaz owner likewise J will have another week um okay more worried of Diaz owna fine yeah uh I don't know maybe it's because I've got jot maybe if I had Diaz I'd be looking a different way you always kind of worried about your own players and rotation um I was debating doing joted Diaz this week until I saw those saw those comment especially when I saw Diaz not playing in the Champions League I thought oh he's just resting him for for the weekend but it could well be gakpo coming in for him um my guess would be it comes in for for J if anything but yeah we see uh would anunu be a bad transfer in yes let's be honest yes he would uh bashu wolves have a decent one of fix off the game we six kuna and he Chan an option stran lson as well was impressive him the goal they scored was lovely I love that little step over and the and the finish and and TR lson did really well to you know you know come down the ball come down the wing and put that put that ball in um trouble is wolves are just getting battered every week and you know even with good performances they're still losing games um lost in the cup again you know O'Neal's already under a bit of pressure I think to um to start getting results even though the fixures remain not not good and where's the confidence going to be I think there's better options than than kuner and and hang going forward I won't be going kind of anywhere near anywhere near them uh Eddie says I've got J and Diaz I'm more worried about jotter okay it's not just me then that's good uh qka plus u zero Captain e or Bruno choose one please Palace have got it's Palace United isn't it I wouldn't Captain a I don't think Bruno's got more Roots into points I guess with the penalties I I don't I wouldn't want to Captain either them if you've got harand just Captain Harland over those two we talked about Trent earlier as an option Salah I think is probably the best option you've got Watkins as well if you haven't got any of those what are you doing what team have you got where you haven't got any of those options yeah I don't know I would going near resel bre I think that's that's a low scoring game uh for me uh FPL upro I've got Bailey do you think he starts he was back in the squad wasn't he I was surprised at that I thought he maybe needed a little bit more time out with Bailey as he's kind of always getting injured so will he start V have been playing well without him no I think he's probably on the bench and and comes on a bit later on if you if you're holding on to him I guess you keep him now and hope he gets back in but Rams is playing really well isn't he um so I don't I don't think Bailey comes straight back in um waiting till he starts before if you buy him I definitely wouldn't be if he would buying him Eddie says how highly do you rate beliber not for FPL just in general he came in last season and I watched him play a few times and I thought this is kind of a quite raw player loads of energy you know talented footballer but what is his best position is he is he an eight is he a six is he the Ceda replacement is he someone who's going to bomb forward a bit more and be like a a Ramy or Yaya té like what does he want to be um in the side was really really impressed with him against IP switch scored a goal yesterday as well I think this is a we do this quite a lot we we have a player who comes in it's happened with cedo it's happened with um basuma you know we have a player who comes in they have a first year with us where they don't look that great second year they look a lot better so I'm Gilmore um as well actually ofer in that position in and around that kind of 8 to six Mark I don't think belber is is our cassada replacement I think that's weer so that's fine so that enables bber now to kind of Mark stamp his Mark a bit more on the team to be that kind of eight type player not an FPL asset I think he's going to go and have a really really good season I think he started really strongly he looks strong he looks quick he looks fit loads of energy he's adding some goals to his game and he's making really good runs through the middle so yeah really impressed with him really happy to to have him um and yeah see kind of what he what happens to him and how much he builds on last season uh Stephen Gallagher says she's lip reading he's lip reading Sam's phone call I think it's going badly there's lots of laughter at the start but now things have yeah a bit worried can you hear me Sam can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down how it's going noed it's fine uh qka says I've got Harland but I'm a gunner supporter won't Captain Harland yeah fair enough then you probably are looking at someone a bit Rogue then aren't you if you haven't got Salah or or Watkins um you haven't got Trent as well who do you go for I just I wouldn't trust a or or Fernandez in that FB opo says I've got start even moon is or Bailey how are you in this position already after game week four uh I probably start yeah I probably would start Bailey he could do some damage off the Ben against against wolves but yeah I can't I can't see him starting uh Robert Browning as what about WEA he's back from his injury looked good before he was injured plus played last night good price too good price no you're not buying him FPL wise no chance he's DM you buy bber at the same price if you really want someone um but he he will make our defense better options so uh you back with us Sam I'm back is all right I very everyone's been very concerned in the chat as to what's been happening oh no so it's okay it's okay okay good good it's okay it's well now you're back we can do our plug for sleeper oh yes let's talk about sleeper yeah talk to me what what we got here I've been sending some screens what's that me I see some I see some teams I see some points so we as a scout uh group have got our own sleeper league and last week was our first round of fixtures I was thoroughly annoyed as because you know what happened in our what happened you lost I did but to by half a point half a point is that that's this one right this is this was your team oh this is your team this week this is my team so I yeah so I last week I was paying Ed very annoying hate list to Ed as well but and but it was all on delit he had delit and Shaw and I was like I'm done now which one's Ed oh Ed is fa pip yeah yeah okay and and it very an three quars of a point three qus of a point there you go and it was just like oh man alive come on like if one of those worldly goals doesn't go in then we're fine um but yeah so but it's actually been really good and I really like it so we're playing this um together as a core team this week I'm playing Scott um who actually I'm not sure you've ever met Scott um my team is looking a bit difficult xery greish Tans petta Johnson TR oh my God Sam how did you end up with this I don't know as I basically don't know so I I didn't even have last pick like so I don't I just was a bit of a disaster I I have I got Trent and then I got havs and then after that it got hard I think I got I think I got visa and then I got CBA and then obviously now Visa's injured so now I've got problems and the problem is as we know from doing our draft of Legends league is that actually when you've got 10 people in a league and therefore 170 players picked there's often not that many players just available that you can go for yeah and just to clarify this is a draft team that you haven't picked these players when you could pick anyone yeah just to clarify for British 87 yeah no I I actually did not um this is is not like a this is not like a um an FPL team uh and yeah and so actually like the Visa injury is it has been difficult and I have him in all three of my draft teams that I've got on sleeper so I have got him in the draft of Legends I've got him in this one and I've got him in my patreon one as well and it's difficult because I'm looking at the ones that are available and I'm like and I actually haven't got enough forwards then to kind of to deal with it so uh this week I went car I think I bought in I can't remember what I've done I don't think I've done anything with this team yet I've just moved Vista into the reserve spot maybe I bought somebody I can't remember um but actually there's a lot of things that need to here like really long term do I want greish do I want Bernardo silver like I don't I think I just went I'll collect a couple sh says sashan there you go I don't think I can get in sharder I think somebody's already got sharder but I'll go and have a look and see where the sharder is available but I suspect that Sharda might actually be already in fact I'll look now while I'm talking to you but I think Sharda might already be in a team uh so actually there are and like I've got issues there because obviously I've got cash and Shaw who are both injured I'm not going to lie Sam it looks an absolute train wreck of a a team it's a shambles it's an utter shambles I I am having a nightmare in like and I thought I was quite well set up you know like I in terms of like my my key personnel and then I was like oh I'll just um yeah you see look Tom's got shot Char moved early yeah I can try and trade him I don't know what is the lap gone says Peter well let's have a look imagine if he's not is the lp gone yeah because BL and Tom Freeman's got him as well Tom Freeman's got him as well oh no he's got all of your players I don't I just I mean what who anyone else got any advice because I mean this lot is a shambles um I yeah look it but the thing is the last week was I'm supposed to win this week if you look at the match dance that we had up a minute ago I'm supposed to beat Scott by a law there you go look oh yeah oh no 52% that's supposed to beat Scott um I don't know so I'll just say the reason there's um there's kind of Point um uh point is because it's not the same completely the same as FPL rules you can set the rules to include interceptions key passes crosses all that stuff um if you haven't given sleeper a try yet there's a link in the description uh below do draft with your friends build a better team than Sam and you might win some games there you go so right so the forwards that we have available in the core team draft I could get himz yeah doesn't fill me with no Cameron Archer no Jack Harrison no thanks Antonio no thanks Jack Clark no Robinson no Evan Ferguson no to be honest gimenez is the best option out of those and then you just drop him when when he loses his place again which is probably inevitable andw John Duran is free yeah Super Sub John Duran it's not terrible is it I don't hate that yeah um Dario says Harrison's got a good set of pictures coming up good point oh yeah but everon right we're moving off sleeper we could be here all day if you're interested in set up draft League links in the description it's really good it is really good it's a really good app really slick um you can see from these screenshots you know it works really well um you know definitely give it a try if you haven't already download the app uh join the Scout pick them league as well and the family pick them league and the blackbox pick Le prizes monthly prizes and overall prizes and everything so we have weekly prizes you have weekly prizes wow yeah poor old Ed's got to sort those out he loves it he loves sending out vouches every week uh let's take a couple more questions um before we finish uh for the day uh K Robertson what front for you he playing for Brighton against Forest as M played a lot of minutes next week I think it will be I think if Pedro's had a training session I think he's back in in the side so I think it' be well bet Pedro Moman and M um I know M's played a lot of minutes um gruda is not backo he's he's still injured um ad dingra could play he's he's been playing well um scored again could see a dingra start I guess but I think Mt is too important to to what we're trying to do so I think it'll be those it'll be those four um sashan says I have antia and ferdy do I start them this week I'm guessing ferdy is ferdy kadogo and Keta he's some we haven't talked about he's another option around the Six Million Mark isn't he is he available for you sleeper te I just thought exactly the same thing hang on uh no Tom Johnson's got him okay what about for FPL he's an option definitely last week yeah yeah yeah definitely an option it's it's interesting though isn't it because I think I think in that budget forward section there's actually quite a lot of good options it's just the middle bracket of prices that are a bit like not sure anybody's really standing out but if you want to go in the budget end like she quite liking ker I think you start him against Manu I think he gets something in in that game right and I think I think kog is obviously a bit of a risk because there's a stupid and there hinwood has been playing but he got some minutes against ipswitch he came off the bench again yesterday and scored a goal I be surprised if he didn't start um a left back maybe hinch would moves into Midfield so yeah I would start both of those players I think I think they're both pretty good pretty good options Kum says there too many Toms in your sleeper League yeah there really is isn't there it's confusing no there's only two of them Tom J and Tom F but that's one one too many on to many times uh F says I've got one free transfer should I roll or take on the moon is Bailey problem wild card in six or seven you surely have to make a transfer to get rid of moones bayy well Bailey was back in the squad I think you keep him as see if he gets back in but you've got to get rid of moones we just talked about all the options that you could have I'd be doing moones to any other six million is Striker wouldn't you like literally any of the ones Calvin Luen vardy Ina dap for a hit I'm I'm thinking about taking him for a hit so if you've got a free transfer I would absolutely do it yeah Adam steo this is something I was debating jot out from boomo week early purely a minute's decision um I think while you were on the call with school we were talking well I say we were talking I was talking solely to myself about jotter and Diaz and gakpo and what that what that means because obviously there was the comments from slot about gakpo and Diaz jota hasn't been playing very well though um could we see gakpo taking J's place up front could we see him playing instead of Diaz on the left is's a bit of uncertainty I think going into into this week I wouldn't take J out ahead of this week though nah I'm not going to no one more week see how he does but he's got a he got to deliver this week if he doesn't you just get mumo next week agreed I don't think mumo goes mad against Spurs Famous Last Words as he could get a goal but I don't think he goes I don't think he goes and gets like a 15p pointer he better not I got go and do my marathon after that as imagine if he gets a hattick I haven't got him Spurs Los and then I have to walk a marathon thinking about it yeah that's in a thunderstorm that's apparently coming in on Saturday night oh no that's definitely not ideal uh final question for the day is from edin Casey Edie Casey's on a wild card uh what do you think of this world card Reyes sber Robertson mazwi sacka Bowen gacho mcneel and bumo Harem Watkins with fabianski Collins Howard Bellis and Stewart on the bench I mean there's no bad options there I'd go I'd go Greaves instead of Howard Bellis yeah Greaves over har Bellis I'm not sure about gacho he's not starting is he i' get I'd take gacho out of there as well yeah i' do garnacho to another 65 Maybe um or even go down to like a m or Smith row um I would do that because then you can take Stewart up you could have you could have a you could have a deap or similar yeah I don't hate it the issue is you got two Arsenal players well three Arsenal players at away at city um yes it's not it's not a great weeks of wild card I don't think but yeah I that's probably about as good as it gets to be fair G show G showan and Har Bellis are the ones I get I completely agree yeah y cool we will end it there Sam thank you as always hopefully apologies for disappearing it's all right hopefully dap gets you a few goals this we what will end up happening here you know what's going to happen don't you already isack to Watkins for a hit no dap dap Patrick I will no I didn't need to take a hit I can just go esack to Watkins so what will happen here is I'll get the fear I'll go esack to Watkins I will not take the hit and then dap's going to get Hatty and I'm going to cry about the fact that I didn't take the hit and he's got a hatch that's exactly what happened and you'll be clipping your you saying about the laugh and we be going well you didn't do it though did you and you'll be like yeah but I was close and I taught me out of it cuz everyone that's the other thing that Lee annoyed me about on our live stream is he kept he said because I said about the switch clean sheet and he said yeah but you go on so much stuff in a week you're bound to say it on something aren't you I was I don't go on every show and say something different on the basis that I can then that's what he does is it that's what he does what I do I say the same thing everywhere glass houses Lee bloody hell telly it and actually I note that when he went on Off the Bench he started using some of the stats that I pulled out on our live stream I was like whoa hang on B yeah I said that to you last night You' just copied me well we will finish on this question from Dario which I think is solely aimed at you MH should I sell harand for dap yes no did do that and that's click thanks everyone have a great end to your week uh enjoy game week five and Sam and I will be back next week bye guys for,10134,good afternoon everyone welcome to your qa ahead of game week five from fantasy football scout with myself as and someone who looks a little bit like david dickinson a few minutes ago thanks to a weird orange light that was like shining in her face its sam mfield how are you sam im having a day as honestly like i dont even know whats going on anymore ive just been at meeting at my kids school panic driven as quickly as possible home put the wrong light on looked like id been tangoed by you were like i just ill just put this light on what do you think boom like orange cuz ive got a new camera and i tweaked around with the settings on it im still not loving it particularly but anyway wor about that another time thats thats another problem for another day but this light is my favorite light i use it might be able to show you no i cant the wires in the way its my favorite light i like to work by it cuz its got a nice theres something about the shade of the light that it gives out thats nice for working under like its not bright if what apparently it makes me look orange orange it was a bit of a shock when you when you turned off and put that put on was like a bad tan job imagine i got the fancy show tomorrow imagine if i went on it like that the makeup ladies be like theres no saving theres no saving there we cant do anything cant fix that hi to everyone in the chat hi to cameron star mentioning spurs is narrow win against centry in the cup yesterday hi to eddie hi to karim tia hi to british 87 hi to flaty boy who says after no questions for me no sub needed off the wild card last week looking forward to seeing what questions are being asked today ian smith say wouldnt be a live stream if one of them wasnt late your fault today no lets not lets not because i was here exactly on the right time and you sent me a load of links that didnt work thats a good point although no well you bet be at 17 pass saying the link didnt work thats well i was here i was here at 13 past okay and then and then i to call you to say i cant 13 past is pushing it though for a quarter past stream im have you met me my me my meeting did not finish until 4 and then i had to get from their school and get two kids from another room where they were being babysat while i did this meeting and then get home in the excuses to me same and i havent got a cup of tea and im too hot so its a lot going on and youve been tangoed and i know you said just you put your sunglasses on before we came on as well and then was like what am i doing its been a weird start to this mark southern is in the chat with his weird little purple emoji thing blowing bubble gum that i dont know its how i know its him though cuz no one else would have that he says still got barcat i want to swap for another brighton defender but heard theyre getting smashed this week what should i do hes convinced that forest are going to do a number on brighton im im the opposite i think bright are going to win this what do you think brighty forest excited can i get you and mark in a room while this is happening what the game can i be in a room with you two when this is happening we havent been to see a game yet we keep talking about going up to the city ground or to the mx but we havent arranged it yet but hes hes very adamant that forest are going to win this one whats your prediction do you think n nil god no ive gotone in my sleeper pick and ive gone for a draw because i genuinely i genuinely think that its going to be nil that is sitting on the fence to a to a new level i dont want to upset either of the black bo boys no thats very true thats very true good point if you are good if this this isnt a serious question because its from mark and i dont think he care less about what i think about bright defends but if you are going to get a bright defender i think you could be making a case for a certain turkish leftish rightish back in kadogo scored in the cup yesterday i think he probably starts might need a few more weeks just to make sure hes naed in the team but one to watch i think he looks good i like him prob go on loan next now ive said that generational tent shut up spaghetti replace munes or should i bench him and play seeno im replacing min this week i think im taking a hit this i think might tak a hit you out just go for it replace my whole front line who you getting do you want to give a bit more more or you keeping your cards close to your chest no its a little bit tbc still because were going to see what presses what joy presses brings tomorrow but im my current thinking is watkins and dap i like that i am fully invested in liam deap so is that is that esack and to watkins andap and but that just allows me to keep all my budget that ive got in the bank in the bank because im taking the five from min kn and putting it on putting it on esack would you would you played that this week southampton he looks good he looks good to la its just the minutes he got subbed early against brian i dont know why he looked he looked good against us just not sure hes fully fit yet but they need him i think i think so i like him im just decided like i get like this dont i and i just get fully invested in one player and thats it he is the man at the moment okay obsessed no what im not going to give you any stick about it because i quite like him as well i was talking about him on black box last night i think he could he could get 10 goals i think for switches this season 55 good value when you went here last week i went rogue i just was as i do did you watch it back i just spent the whole time talking about how much i like tip switch and how i thought that they were going to get six clean sheets before game week 16 and then they went and then they went and got one against you five more and i was like so i taking that as gospel that i now know everything about and youre not buying a defender youre buying there the striker i want a defender as well thatll be next week ill buy a defender yep peta says deap is the new pooky y could be you were obsessed with pooky a few seasons ago as well he bought p didnt i i forgot about that i did youre right eddie says prefer deap to as his ms favorite mcin mcs mcs not a favorite anymore shes gone off him she saw him getting a bit larry so she took him out of the team and hes pretty much dead to her now honestly its very fickle in this house with things like that kareim says thinking of trent as captain this week i have robo and j trent captain versus bournemouth i think bournemouth score do you i dont im thinking about tr trent as captain you about say trotter we about to combine trent and j as trot i got like that as a double up im on the trotter double up that is my double up thats the double up ive got just throw my stress bone on the floor have you not got sellah no okay and if watkins is fair then ill have watkins and then ill probably captain him but i am thinking about tren as captain i dont think its a terrible idea i think his underly numbers are good i think theres a clean sheet like bournemouth they were good against chelsea and they didnt stve to lose the game against chelsea but equally i didnt think they were that great going forward and i dont know that i see them scoring against that liverpool defense so i think theres a clean sheet there again for liverpool and it trents only got to get the clean sheet and one attack in return and youre in a double digit hall and id like to captain on that but i dont think its terrible this week he got a big hole against bournemouth was it last season well maybe the season before when was the big they got 9 n didnt they that was the nine two years ago now was it salah didnt return in that at all trent scored i think in that game and nothing for sala its two years ago that wasnt last season two no i dont i dont mind it trent got two assists last night didnt they no not last night the night before for van djk and canate dont hate it i think if you dont have salah hes hes as good as anyone its probably for me its probably salot toop and then id even put harland in just because its harland watkins probably is second and then anyone else is probably a bit of a punt but good week to have a punt because the captain is going to be split exactly y cameron stars someone we talked about black box last night sharda for a budget midfielder 54m i think he is likely to play up front with visa out he paid came on for him didnt he i think he plays up front there is a slight wonder in my mind as to whether he plays car valo and then puts some bomo but there are other he has got other options but we have seen brenford play since in the league cup i think sher is a nice differential spurs defense is well woeful wow har it is like if anyone sits here and says anything other than that then i thought you defended all right against arsenal just not from set pieces which is just continues to be a problem thats the problem though isnt it is that do what weirdly we werent terrible from most set pieces like there were a number of set pieces that arsenal took where we defended fine and then theres just a couple that if you get it right and then it can be exploited now brentfords i think brenford score against us they always score against us thats just how it is so b on spurs clean sheet and i think as a budget as budgets go there may be some rotation with him if frank decides to use different assistance because he does have the personnel to do something slightly different but with visa out for two months there should be plenty of game time for sharder and therefore i dont think its a terrible idea at all no nor do i quite like its i think you want another week ideally because thats when the good fixtures start and then we might know a bit more about how theyre going to line up without v so i think wait if you can i dont think theres going to be too many wild cards this week given the arsenal and city play each other but i think theres going to be a million wild cards played in game week six probably maybe even more than that and i think its going to be very popular in the in the f community as well are you are you going to be wild carding in six no holding it do when youre thinking of using it 12 14 16 something like that so l much later late much later the thing is ive got double arsenal already i can easily make it trouble like im not feeling like my team i think that my team isnt far weirdly its not far away from the team that most people wild card too like i can get triple arsenal and bomo next week relative well easily so im not im not planning to wild card the only issue is that a lot of people will and therefore a risk of price changes and that stuff but equally if you wild card it doesnt affect the price changes anyway so the more people that are on it the less chance there is of that being an issue to me not true alapo trent got one assist sima got the van dyke assist there you go only one assist but still like you say if they can get a clean she against bourn he gets a an assist hes hes on for double digits isnt he 12 13 points probably so decent option farz says should i start face or gabrielle neither of them are clean sheet so gabrielle i dont think its worth backing leicester defense over someone with as much attacking threat as gabrielle from set pieces also i think that game could be nil thats the prediction ive gone for in that city arsenal neither team want to lose i think hes got draw written all over it is it a scor or is it a nil i dont disagree with you id play gabrielle fenor says lee is right about an hell be gone off this season lee said that an is got one more season left did he lee and i nearly got divorced on sunday on the middle of our live stream cuz he was being a total he was just trying to w me up and le i cant imagine that as i wish id married you at that point on sunday honestly i was like what is my life how am i sitting here having just cuz ive been to the north london derby as well so having just got home from that to then have to sit there and listen to him spout a load of absolute tosh just to just to wre me up i was im done with you and theyve lost to bloody forest as well and i said nothing rude about slot and liverpool and all of that nothing he was a disgrace i dont think hes right i think hes completely wrong i wasnt very impressed with po gl in the post match i will on sunday he comes across very i dont he doesnt come across well in interviews anymore i dont know whats happened to him in the last year he was so he just gets fed up with being asked the same stupid questions over and over and over again like do not think like when you think about what he was being asked at the beginning when he first died it was all like quite positive and stuff like that because we started the season well last year then we had all those injuries and then every week they asked him the same questions why arent you good from set pieces well weve got a loan of injuries and these players are out why have we why have we not got this we cant buy anyone to replace these players im having to play players out position and it was the same answers every week and its like stop asking the same stupid questions and i feel like this season it started in a similar way they keep just asking him about negative things and so because of that he then gives quite negative answers whereas when you listen to him on the like interviews that he does for like spurs and for channels where hes not being asked stupid questions i keep throwing my stress ball on the floor he doesnt spurs he comes he comes across well in those in those interviews still like still the same sorts of things so i dont know i just think that the press manipulate things to how they want to be okay well i dont want to ruin this nice qa atmosphere by going in on spur so im going to im going to take your word im going to take your word for it everyones everyones saying everyones talking about lee in your argument now so i cant take any of those any of those questions let like a nice one about sanchez rob sanchez hes nice and safe what you think of rob sanchez do you trust the cha defense no like i appreciate that he got a haul in game week four what a performance from sanchez bloody h right he played incredibly well and he saved a penalty so deserves the hall but aside from that hole ive not seen anything from him that would suggest that he was worth it and theres still the fact that theyve signed this other goalkeeper and at some point i was expecting him to start in one of these games so i think if you are i dont i dont want to be this i feel like im ipswich is like number one cheerleader at the moment but genuinely if i was going for 45 right now id still go for miric which is what i said last week my god you are on the switch train last week i tractor last week i said id go for id go for mck and i still would if you dont want to be on it switch and youve still only got 45 then fleen would be my choice over sanchez its always when you look at goalkeepers and you see 212 and then a massive hall of 15 seven saves saved the penalty as well but bournemouth scor that penalty and hes getting two points again or three points and it was a good save and he made a load of great saves but youve always got to think theyre lucky to save a penalty penalty is down to a combination of things but youd back the attacker in youd back the penalty taken the majority of times so okay he saved the penalty but if that goes in hes getting another blank essentially and then no ones talking about him at all so unless you think chelsea are a good defensive side who are going to keep clean sheets and with goalkeepers clean sheets have always been important they are essential now because goalkeepers do not get bonus if they dont keep clean sheets no so im looking at those fixes west ham away brighton forest liverpool newcastle man united arsenal realan in there at all realistically how many keep that none they got like hes coming up against bowen this weekend at west ham dont see a clean sheet there you lot cant see a clean sheet there like youre youre like by then j pedro back surely i dont see it i just i dont think theres any clean sheets for chelsea like i dont i think def if you want to go for a chelsea attacker then go for it but i just wouldnt touch the defense including the goalkeeper i think you if you go for sanchez youll feel how i feel about henderson disappointed and sad thats how i feel about him must try harder you see he he got as many point reyya got as many points as henderson has all season in one game good that made me feel disgraceful when i heard you say that one off the bench i was like what is my life that ive got this palace goalkeeper what my scenes going all right but that was that was a bad decision cameron star says as i have sanchez and ver bren i got it wrong last week whats your opinion i dont think you got it wrong you got it wrong with the outcome but i you i would definitely have played the brogan at home to whip switch in that match and like i said if that penalty go in then its for br who gets the bigger the bigger hall so i wouldnt worry about it out of out of those two if they got similar fixures id play for bren i think were a better defensive team than chelsea you just rotate in and out based on the fixures so this week you play this week you play the bren home to forest next week you probably play sanchez were playing each other then brighton are on a bit of a bad run so then you play sanchez again i dont know its its not a too bad combination but when youve got two four fs theres going to be weeks when theres points on the bench i hate rotating goalkeepers dont you i do too i just wish id spent the five on rare at the 55 on rare at the beginning so do i so it annoys me so much that i didnt do that but we are where we are yep theres quite a few questions on esack edwin says should i sell isack for gimenez or vardy i saw another question from brian says what to do with esack as well i sold him last week i was another one from mim just come in is replacements if youre not well cut in game six i sold him last week i went into wolves absolutely terrified that he would haul went off at halim feel like i got away with that if hes if its not going to happen but lets say in a crazy twist of fate hell comes out tomorrow and gives us some useful team news about isach and he says hes fit hes fine hell definitely start against fulham would that put you off selling him well theres apparently multiple problems with eack now isnt theres this ive got an eye issue that i picked up in the last game and now ive got a toe issue have you seen the picture of is a pirate with an eye patch and a peg leg so hes got hes got multiple problems i nearly said i nearly nam that song ive got 19 probably j never mind so d with the kid sam that song that came out about 30 years ago as ive not been down with the kids ever probably what was the question isach ive got isach i am planning to wait until how speaks tomorrow in the hope that he says something vaguely useful but i dont think he will and the thing is next week i would sell him anyway so but youd be looking at selling him for a hit right well so i could just do that one move i could just do isack to watkins okay you dont need the money from mo toap three million in the bank something stupid so should we doing moon is to deap for a hit that seems that seems a bit unnecessary doesnt it i thought you needed the money to dock up no i dont need the money god ive just got dap hype youve lost your mind its possibly true its possibly true i dont need the money so i can just go isack to do that to what kinson be done with it do but i just dont want moone in anymore either because the thing is whats going to happen next week is that i will want to get in bomo so then next week ill be dealing with that plus i might take another minus four next week to deal with the goalkeeper so at that point then mo you said your team was fine a minute ago well its only mo isach and hendo that i want to get rid of three and so i can deal with one this week or two this week and then the other one next week but the thing is that i dont like i just feel like if i dont get rid of m this week and i just do isack then next week rolls in i get a bomo and i get ryer or maybe ill wait one more week and i get ryer because i think palace have got everton so maybe i could wait one more week and get r but then means that munise is then getting a stay of execution like every week but i dont want him so might as well just get rid but then the other flip of this is the in my spurs delusional mind salanki might salanki might suddenly to be decide to be peak salanki again start playing like last season and if that happens i dont want the lap and ive taken a hit to just see this is what as i told you before this stream youre overing arent you im not all right i dont think im all right at the minute i think im a bit all over the place and theres a theres been a lot going on this week and i think my brain has turned a little bit mushy what is likely to happen here is that i just do esack to watkins and in answer to your original question that what was that dont know about youve gone on such a tangent i cant even remember what it was something about what should we do about esack should we and we said about waiting on the presser but i think hes got so many injury problems hes probably not going to play i think if you can afford to go straight from eack to watkins thats the move y its if you cant afford to go straight what do you do thats the bigger issue because i think you can come down and you can come down quite a lot and if you come down a lot then theres theres options like youve got welbeck youve got dap youve got jamie vardy if you fancy a pary this weekend youve even got cal le in if you cant going absolutely mental so theres theres four options there but if you that like in that middle bracket nobodys performing or if they are they dont have the best fixture so like weve got salanki whos about to have a nice fixture on but isnt performing yet because spurs my plan transfer this week before game week four was youre gna say mata to salanki thats not what i thought you going to say so my plan this week was to go e act to watkins and mooneys to visa and then he got injured out for two months so then im like ive got to deal with it amazing how quickly things changed because i thought mateta blanked in the games i own him for e on penalties well youre not saying mateta now surely no exactly i think matas a good pick id put mata in that bracket of someone that you can consider if youre getting rid of e that like but i think that like six and a half to to havs is quite difficult to pick from because youve either got mateta who up until last week wasnt showing anything but then last week suddenly we understand that hes sharing the penalty responsibility which we didnt think he had like we didnt think he had because i thought that was e but now he looks like a hold youve got visa who i was that was my plan i was like this is perfect it means i dont have to get emb bomo straight away because i can have him and then i can double up after spurs perfect then he gets injured soank comes back and i was like okay if i see something against arsenal or in the league cup against centry then ill go there because a lowkey spurs fixtures are great after brenford including brenford to be honest theyre going under the radar because were so terrible at the minute but i think the problem with sank is i havent yet seen it now i was at the north lon derby he played well sanke he was a menace he was in all the right places he was doing all the right things we created nothing y and thats a problem right so i personally im going to wait one more week cuz i think he needs to hit the ground running it needs to be a goal once a goal comes for sank i feel like things will improve for him but im going to wait another week on that havoc i dont think i think hes a good option but were backing that cycle of well tonight thatre arsenal playing in the champions league so weird isnt it to have champions league on a thursday i dont like its a bit odd have hes in the league table as well its like absolute mess its and it reminds me of like the super cup stuff that we didnt want like this league now but anyway i dont mind the idea that villa wont play young boys again cuz who cares they played them once they were at home they gave them a chance they done them over 30 whatever it was and now they can move on to other games like it was it was a little bit stale that whole lets play home and away in all the group stages its the same three teams i do like the idea that they play different clubs but i dont like the big league table i think thats ridiculous its just a bit to me i just love the champions league like h like i get what youre saying about maybe its a bit st but i just think its an its just i loved it and it feels a bit weird at the minute like well see as time goes on as to whether it improves and what have you but so arsenal playing tonight erard now this is a bigger problem than we like last week we didnt understand what it was and we were saying that he was rumored to be being out for 3 weeks now it looks like its going to be more than 3 weeks now against spurs we got some insight i think but that insight was a little bit tampered by rice also not being there whereas i think at the weekend and tonight we might get more of an insight into wheres hs playing yep as we also saw my kid school is calling me dont take it you go take it i can i can i mute you for a minute i can carry on ill take some other questions all right ill be back in two seconds ill stay here you can see me but ill myself well see well see from well try and work out from sams reaction what whats happening with the kids is it good news or is its never its never good news is it when the scorings hopefully its hopefully its fine big tips e has lost his m get for me with no pens im all about inuma at that price point i think i was e was the player i was most worried about i think going into this week and if youd offered me the switch from mateta to e i would have taken it 100 times out of 100 and mata stting up stepping up taking the second penalty is one of those one of those great moments you have in fpl which youre just completely not expecting i dont think e is a problem for people whove got him i still think hes a good hes a good pick but i would be prioritizing mumo over e now hes lost pens for sure ep onions school is telling sam not to trip up on ip switch especially taking a hit for the lap come on sam if youre listening if you can hear me maybe its going to go in subliminally but dont dont do that got mentioning about the format know what people think about the new champions league format too many games this new champions league i dont like it so far but we will see i i like i said i think the group stages i didnt watch a lot of group stage matches and i do switch off a little bit from football when its not the when its not the premier league i dont watch any england friendlies anymore for example i watch the tournaments i watched the champions league knockout games but group stages ive not huge fan of to havent watch any the champions league even with a new format either so but like i said i think at least it gives a bit more variety and we get to see some slightly bigger games from some of the top the top clubs but its is a lot of matches now i dont think it needed more games but well see how it how it goes fny boys a fan as a celtic fan this is it as long as i think as long as as long as everyones happy as long as its not just your liverpools your man cities and your arsenal fans happy with it if teams from fans from teams where maybe not expected to get such a long run in the in the in the side of happy then thats the the main the main thing callum robertson this is a good question do you think gakpo will start over diaz so im a jotter owner my worry is much more that gakpo starts over him i know gakpo has been used mostly on the on the left thats where slot seems to like him the most i know there was those comments about diaz he was going to play gakpo i think it was and then he came back tired from international break so he played player who had gone off and even more done even more traveling i couldnt understand that but it was interesting that he made that comparison with diaz and gakpo so he clearly does want gakpo on the left gakpo played well in the champions league j was poor and thats a couple of poor games for him i wouldnt be surprised to see diaz jotter and cah up front im im going to give im going to give j another week as nikolai says gakpo isnt a striker for slot no chance i hope i hope not because i dont think darwins a factor so that would mean j would probably start again but what happens if jot has another poor game against bournemouth theres going to have to be changes and if darwin is so phased out i wonder if even if he doesnt see him as a as a striker if he might just play him in that position anyway so no move to me this week give j another week but well see how it goes rob browny agrees with that i dont i dont think subie morid is a diaz owner likewise j will have another week okay more worried of diaz owna fine i dont know maybe its because ive got jot maybe if i had diaz id be looking a different way you always worried about your own players and rotation i was debating doing joted diaz this week until i saw those saw those comment especially when i saw diaz not playing in the champions league i thought hes just resting him for the weekend but it could well be gakpo coming in for him my guess would be it comes in for j if anything but we see would anunu be a bad transfer in yes lets be honest yes he would bashu wolves have a decent one of fix off the game we six kuna and he chan an option stran lson as well was impressive him the goal they scored was lovely i love that little step over and the and the finish and tr lson did well to come down the ball come down the wing and put that put that ball in trouble is wolves are just getting battered every week and even with good performances theyre still losing games lost in the cup again oneals already under a bit of pressure i think to to start getting results even though the fixures remain not good and wheres the confidence going to be i think theres better options than kuner and hang going forward i wont be going anywhere near anywhere near them eddie says ive got j and diaz im more worried about jotter okay its not just me then thats good qka plus u zero captain e or bruno choose one please palace have got its palace united isnt it i wouldnt captain a i dont think brunos got more roots into points with the penalties i dont i wouldnt want to captain either them if youve got harand just captain harland over those two we talked about trent earlier as an option salah i think is probably the best option youve got watkins as well if you havent got any of those what are you doing what team have you got where you havent got any of those options i dont know i would going near resel bre i think thats thats a low scoring game for me fpl upro ive got bailey do you think he starts he was back in the squad wasnt he i was surprised at that i thought he maybe needed a little bit more time out with bailey as hes always getting injured so will he start v have been playing well without him no i think hes probably on the bench and comes on a bit later on if you if youre holding on to him you keep him now and hope he gets back in but rams is playing well isnt he so i dont i dont think bailey comes straight back in waiting till he starts before if you buy him i definitely wouldnt be if he would buying him eddie says how highly do you rate beliber not for fpl just in general he came in last season and i watched him play a few times and i thought this is a quite raw player loads of energy talented footballer but what is his best position is he is he an eight is he a six is he the ceda replacement is he someone whos going to bomb forward a bit more and be like a ramy or yaya té like what does he want to be in the side was impressed with him against ip switch scored a goal yesterday as well i think this is a we do this quite a lot we have a player who comes in its happened with cedo its happened with basuma we have a player who comes in they have a first year with us where they dont look that great second year they look a lot better so im gilmore as well ofer in that position in and around that 8 to six mark i dont think belber is our cassada replacement i think thats weer so thats fine so that enables bber now to mark stamp his mark a bit more on the team to be that eight type player not an fpl asset i think hes going to go and have a good season i think he started strongly he looks strong he looks quick he looks fit loads of energy hes adding some goals to his game and hes making good runs through the middle so impressed with him happy to have him and see what he what happens to him and how much he builds on last season stephen gallagher says shes lip reading hes lip reading sams phone call i think its going badly theres lots of laughter at the start but now things have a bit worried can you hear me sam can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down how its going noed its fine qka says ive got harland but im a gunner supporter wont captain harland fair enough then you probably are looking at someone a bit rogue then arent you if you havent got salah or watkins you havent got trent as well who do you go for i just i wouldnt trust a or fernandez in that fb opo says ive got start even moon is or bailey how are you in this position already after game week four i probably start i probably would start bailey he could do some damage off the ben against wolves but i cant i cant see him starting robert browning as what about wea hes back from his injury looked good before he was injured plus played last night good price too good price no youre not buying him fpl wise no chance hes dm you buy bber at the same price if you want someone but he will make our defense better options so you back with us sam im back is all right i very everyones been very concerned in the chat as to whats been happening no so its okay its okay good its okay its well now youre back we can do our plug for sleeper yes lets talk about sleeper talk to me what we got here ive been sending some screens whats that me i see some i see some teams i see some points so we as a scout group have got our own sleeper league and last week was our first round of fixtures i was thoroughly annoyed as because what happened in our what happened you lost i did but to by half a point half a point is thats this one right this is this was your team this is your team this week this is my team so i so i last week i was paying ed very annoying hate list to ed as well but and but it was all on delit he had delit and shaw and i was like im done now which ones ed ed is fa pip okay and it very an three quars of a point three qus of a point there you go and it was just like man alive come on like if one of those worldly goals doesnt go in then were fine but so but its been good and i like it so were playing this together as a core team this week im playing scott who im not sure youve ever met scott my team is looking a bit difficult xery greish tans petta johnson tr my god sam how did you end up with this i dont know as i dont know so i didnt even have last pick like so i dont i just was a bit of a disaster i have i got trent and then i got havs and then after that it got hard i think i got i think i got visa and then i got cba and then now visas injured so now ive got problems and the problem is as we know from doing our draft of legends league is that when youve got 10 people in a league and therefore 170 players picked theres often not that many players just available that you can go for and just to clarify this is a draft team that you havent picked these players when you could pick anyone just to clarify for british 87 no i did not this is not like a this is not like a an fpl team and and so like the visa injury is it has been difficult and i have him in all three of my draft teams that ive got on sleeper so i have got him in the draft of legends ive got him in this one and ive got him in my patreon one as well and its difficult because im looking at the ones that are available and im like and i havent got enough forwards then to to deal with it so this week i went car i think i bought in i cant remember what ive done i dont think ive done anything with this team yet ive just moved vista into the reserve spot maybe i bought somebody i cant remember but theres a lot of things that need to here like long term do i want greish do i want bernardo silver like i dont i think i just went ill collect a couple sh says sashan there you go i dont think i can get in sharder i think somebodys already got sharder but ill go and have a look and see where the sharder is available but i suspect that sharda might be already in fact ill look now while im talking to you but i think sharda might already be in a team so there are and like ive got issues there because ive got cash and shaw who are both injured im not going to lie sam it looks an absolute train wreck of a team its a shambles its an utter shambles i am having a nightmare in like and i thought i was quite well set up like i in terms of like my key personnel and then i was like ill just you see look toms got shot char moved early i can try and trade him i dont know what is the lap gone says peter well lets have a look imagine if hes not is the lp gone because bl and tom freemans got him as well tom freemans got him as well no hes got all of your players i dont i just what who anyone else got any advice because this lot is a shambles i look it but the thing is the last week was im supposed to win this week if you look at the match dance that we had up a minute ago im supposed to beat scott by a law there you go look no 52 thats supposed to beat scott i dont know so ill just say the reason theres theres point point is because its not the same completely the same as fpl rules you can set the rules to include interceptions key passes crosses all that stuff if you havent given sleeper a try yet theres a link in the description below do draft with your friends build a better team than sam and you might win some games there you go so right so the forwards that we have available in the core team draft i could get himz doesnt fill me with no cameron archer no jack harrison no thanks antonio no thanks jack clark no robinson no evan ferguson no to be honest gimenez is the best option out of those and then you just drop him when he loses his place again which is probably inevitable andw john duran is free super sub john duran its not terrible is it i dont hate that dario says harrisons got a good set of pictures coming up good point but everon right were moving off sleeper we could be here all day if youre interested in set up draft league links in the description its good it is good its a good app slick you can see from these screenshots it works well definitely give it a try if you havent already download the app join the scout pick them league as well and the family pick them league and the blackbox pick le prizes monthly prizes and overall prizes and everything so we have weekly prizes you have weekly prizes wow poor old eds got to sort those out he loves it he loves sending out vouches every week lets take a couple more questions before we finish for the day k robertson what front for you he playing for brighton against forest as m played a lot of minutes next week i think it will be i think if pedros had a training session i think hes back in the side so i think it be well bet pedro moman and m i know ms played a lot of minutes gruda is not backo hes hes still injured ad dingra could play hes hes been playing well scored again could see a dingra start but i think mt is too important to what were trying to do so i think itll be those itll be those four sashan says i have antia and ferdy do i start them this week im guessing ferdy is ferdy kadogo and keta hes some we havent talked about hes another option around the six million mark isnt he is he available for you sleeper te i just thought exactly the same thing hang on no tom johnsons got him okay what about for fpl hes an option definitely last week definitely an option its its interesting though isnt it because i think i think in that budget forward section theres quite a lot of good options its just the middle bracket of prices that are a bit like not sure anybodys standing out but if you want to go in the budget end like she quite liking ker i think you start him against manu i think he gets something in that game right and i think i think kog is a bit of a risk because theres a stupid and there hinwood has been playing but he got some minutes against ipswitch he came off the bench again yesterday and scored a goal i be surprised if he didnt start a left back maybe hinch would moves into midfield so i would start both of those players i think i think theyre both pretty good pretty good options kum says there too many toms in your sleeper league there is isnt there its confusing no theres only two of them tom j and tom f but thats one too many on to many times f says ive got one free transfer should i roll or take on the moon is bailey problem wild card in six or seven you surely have to make a transfer to get rid of moones bayy well bailey was back in the squad i think you keep him as see if he gets back in but youve got to get rid of moones we just talked about all the options that you could have id be doing moones to any other six million is striker wouldnt you like any of the ones calvin luen vardy ina dap for a hit im im thinking about taking him for a hit so if youve got a free transfer i would absolutely do it adam steo this is something i was debating jot out from boomo week early purely a minutes decision i think while you were on the call with school we were talking well i say we were talking i was talking solely to myself about jotter and diaz and gakpo and what that what that means because there was the comments from slot about gakpo and diaz jota hasnt been playing very well though could we see gakpo taking js place up front could we see him playing instead of diaz on the left iss a bit of uncertainty i think going into this week i wouldnt take j out ahead of this week though nah im not going to no one more week see how he does but hes got a he got to deliver this week if he doesnt you just get mumo next week agreed i dont think mumo goes mad against spurs famous last words as he could get a goal but i dont think he goes i dont think he goes and gets like a 15p pointer he better not i got go and do my marathon after that as imagine if he gets a hattick i havent got him spurs los and then i have to walk a marathon thinking about it thats in a thunderstorm thats apparently coming in on saturday night no thats definitely not ideal final question for the day is from edin casey edie caseys on a wild card what do you think of this world card reyes sber robertson mazwi sacka bowen gacho mcneel and bumo harem watkins with fabianski collins howard bellis and stewart on the bench theres no bad options there id go id go greaves instead of howard bellis greaves over har bellis im not sure about gacho hes not starting is he i get id take gacho out of there as well i do garnacho to another 65 maybe or even go down to like a m or smith row i would do that because then you can take stewart up you could have you could have a you could have a deap or similar i dont hate it the issue is you got two arsenal players well three arsenal players at away at city yes its not its not a great weeks of wild card i dont think but i

podcast from Fantasy Football Scout my name is Joe and today I'm going to reveal my game week five plans uh I'll also take a look at the most attacking Defenders uh which will help my decisions uh I'll also look at uh what was good game week four for me um and I hope that continues into game week five probably wishful thinking um plus I'll reveal the latest in my gameweek six Wild Card ear Wild Card early plans um especially what to do with um a spot I had reserved for wiissa um but who is now absent from for injury for another two months um before we do that just uh plug for the members area any stats I show uh here any fixtures i i i discuss that's from the season ticker and there's lots of tools and gadgets there at um fantasy fils SC in the members area I do have a look at the website um to uh get uh an idea of the latest offers uh and the sort of tools that uh are available to help you climb up your mini leagues also do press that like button does help us out do remember to subscribe so you keep up to date with our latest uh videos and podcasts um as well um okay let's have a look at game week four see how that was for me um I got 61 points which was about 10 over the average um which in a in a week where many people had quite a poor week um 61 I feel quite happy with that because basically Harlem was the main one for for most people including myself got 26 points as my captain and it was a whole SE of ones and twos for everyone else so if you owned like one or two players who just did anything else you had a good game week um so I was 1.2 million in the rankings um before the Arsenal game on Sunday I was about 1.1 million little green arrow um but Gabrielle's goal for me and clean sheet that Propel me up to 790k which is great so I I had Henderson a porro Robinson all ones and two points Gabrielle 15 points that's the difference Mina did didn't do anything uh for me Gordon not for one of trying didn't do anything dieo jotter came off at 59 minutes annoyingly 8C short of um if he'd have walked a bit faster that would have been good walked a bit slower rather that would have been good for me Mo Salalah who was new in uh for me uh he got two points Smith row came off the bench for me for J Pedro who was also new in so um effectively so I I move saaka and isach to Salah and Pedro um which um would have I think I would have just just broken even with that or something like no no I would have got um no I would have been down for that because sacka um got an assist but because Smith row came in I actually ended ended that particular move one point up and I'm much happier going into gameweek five with Salah and Pedro if he's fit um rather than sacka uh he faces Man City and has an injury as far as we know at the moment I'm recording this on Wednesday morning I believe this is going out first and Thursday so we may have had some extra news about that isak as well is currently an injury doubt as well apparently had double vision um after face sure head injury during the game which he was substituted last time out um so yeah I'm um uh I'm okay with that I'm okay with that move um so it was for two frees as well so didn't cost me anything munes got me one point um he was replaced by jimnez annoyingly Munez um was in uh League Cup action I didn't do anything um despite almost everyone scoring multiple penalties uh in their penalty shoot out but um so yeah munes um I think it was without penalty yes um munes um sadly didn't do anything for me Harland that 26 points yeah on my bench absolute zeros Barker zero quona zero Pedro zero fabianski zero whole sea of zeros there so um yeah I mean I'm I'm okay with that I'm I'm not I'm not like whoopy whoop with my 61 points because I've re realized that it's a team I think that needs wild carding because the fixtures do change in game week six quite a lot I'm not really set up for that um I'm just tired there's players I've got Mina not really doing it he is Young still could be a good option but I don't think he is at the moment and the fixtur stiffen for Brighton from gameweek six Gordon's okay but I'm happy to lose him as well munz has lost his plays possibly um and he's just not the player I thought he was going to be um um sacka is a Miss now um so I'd like him back for game week six um I think Smith row probably be the only player I might move on that um with a with a with um you know a hany to my eyes as a little tear forms um because I I I think he's a really good option I I may end up just keeping him um but um yeah the rest of him can just go I reckon um so yeah not not a it's okay I'm yeah good score but masking issues here so I'm going to put my gameweek five uh Team Up um so as I said I'm going to Wild Card in game week six I just have that one free transfer so I'll read out my team and I'll explain what what I'll probably be doing depending on different scenarios which by the time you watch this you may know more of of course there's League Cup action during the we uh Wednesday night so I'm calling this before that also um some more Champions League games as well so I'm currently going into this with Henderson in goal um home to Manchester United it's okay not great Pedro por home to brenford I'm okay with that Gabrielle away to Man City I'm basically just not going to bench Gabrielle now because especially in these tougher games what are Arsenal good at set pieces so if they're going to get anything from this game it's going to be a set piece of course they could even get a clean sheet from this Arsenal defense is pretty good but he is against Harland so um somebody's got a give I think if I field Harland and Gabriel I'm hedging my bets a bit Robinson at home to Newcastle I'll explain more I prefer him to be my first sub rather than in my team I've got Minter at home to ningan Forest give him another go if he gets benched I'm okay with him coming on in fact I probably prefer that because he might be a bit more spurred up to do something um Gordon way to Fulham okay with that Diego J at home to Bournemouth um I'm imin okay with that although he did start in the Champions League although he didn't score um Dar Nunes came on and didn't really impress all um and I thought they were a bit better with jotter in the side as well Salah Captain home to Bournemouth very happy with that well I say that now uh Smith r at home to Newcastle I'm just going to play him now for it could be his final game for me harland's my Vice Captain at home to Arsenal and J Pedro if fit home to Nan Forest why not um we will know more because there will be um the Brighton manager will be discussing Pedro's Fitness before Brighton have their League Cup game tonight of which you wouldn't expect Pedro to play that anyway but his availability for it is is of Interest so he could be on the bench for example um the manager could say yeah he's fine but you know I'm not playing him here because it's just League Cup I don't know but um we might get some definite or he might say look he's he's just got to be out for a couple of weeks I've got on my bench I've Got fabianski U munes um is my first sub currently but if he's only going to get a minute and he's at home to newcast I quona is still there somehow barco is still there somehow as well um so my plan moves are I mean is pretty much defense is a problem I would prefer to get Robinson as my first sub rather than mooners because I just feel he might get an assist I mean they could even keep a clean sheet especially if isach is out um but I I think I'd prefer Robinson as a sort of a good bench option I don't really fancy him in my main 11 so what I would I ideally like to do is the move that I was talking about last week which was quansa um out for Robertson um so I I was going to I thought I might have to make that move early this week because Quan's price would go down Robertson's price would go up but Robertson's price hasn't gone up because Liverpool didn't get a clean sheet last time out so people don't like that the he's on about you know on all the statistics sites he's on um I think about 40 % chance of going up at the moment 40% on the way to going up and quon's sort of 30% on to go down so I think if I can survive until sort of Friday afternoon for this I'll about to make that move I've got exact money to do quaner to Robertson at the moment and so Robertson would come in for Robinson would dip down onto the bench there that's that's probably my most sensible move but if Pedro is definitely out so if Pedro is like a out I I'll just play him and just hope my bench come on I mean Smith row came on last week so you know just got to trust in the bench um but if Pedro's definitely out I can move munz because I've got 1.8 million in the bank this the coner to Robertson money I can move munz to someone like um well I can go up to salanki at home to brenford I quite like that um I could go for one we punt on vardy as well I'm okay with that against Everton Calvi Leen is ill at the moment he might have been in my thoughts because I'm wild C in game week six um I'm I'm tempted to use that transfer now other people will say I I see this a lot because we can save these five transfers this season I see lots of people really going for this saving five transfers saving transfers saving transfers but a lot of the teams I'm seeing players managers doing that they're not doing so well because I think you still need to use transfers to addressed the game week at hand um and also last week so I had two free transfers uh I moved Salah is um Salah and Pedro in for isach and sacka if I'd have had three free transfers I would have removed Gabrielle to Robertson I definitely would have done that move and many many people did and I I would have been I would have been well what ever Robinson got two points I would have been 13 points down so that extra transfer would have actually cost me so you got to bear in mind these kinds of things a transfer can also cost you points as well as uh get you points um and also longterm I don't think that would be a good move so anyway um so um what I'll do is um I'm quite happy to take I'm still do that sort of traditional strategy of oh I'm going to Wild Card I'll take a onee pump beforehand because looking at my team I'll put my gameweek six wild card team up in a sec but looking at that whichever sort of pattern I go with I'm pretty happy with that for a good few weeks and I don't think I'm going to have to make that many changes so bit I'm going to hopefully build up transfers that way but but if I need to make a transfer I will um yeah I mean I think uh was it um I think it was Mark SN on one of one of his blackbox um videos was saying similar about that he felt that people would see that as an opportunity with the CH the rule change to save transfers up to to five and they carry through wild cards to to do that and they would miss out then on opportunities and I do think that is the case and I think this week is is an opportunity with a lot of say for example the likes of vardy they've got good fixtures this week and you don't want them long term perfect for a onewe punt I mean I remember I've done that before with you know players you know perhaps you know when Stoke were in the Premier League you know I might go well I'll go for a Stoke midfielder I don't want them long term but you know for one week um so yeah um but I think Rob Robertson is my key one so on that note um I'm going to I've got a table I've done from the fancy Football Scout members area looking at attacking Defenders and I've sorted this by minutes per expected goal involvement obviously they're Defenders they're not going to be huge they're good but um nevertheless I've got L lots of other metrics here um so I was just sort of sort of stress testing my decision there for Robertson fairly confident I'll about to do that there may be an unexpected price change in which case I'll be locked out with that um and then I don't know what I'm going to do I will go for an alternative um uh Defender I think possibly or I might go for that munes to someone like vardy move um or salanki but anyway here is um the list of Defenders um top understandably is Alexander Arnold um but he cost 7 million so I'm locked out of that I can't do that if you can or it's already on your team you should feel lucky he's created 11 chances taken 12 corners and his minutes per Baseline bonus is strong he's racking up one of these Baseline bonus every 6.4 minutes which is very strong sorry I was just taking a sip of water if you were listening to that on the podcast version and just heard a Gulp and some silence um uh he's had no assists um so he should do I suspect he's going to be on this simant table uh on the podcast uh that I do with Mark joblin every week so listen out for that um so yeah um Alexander would be the one to get I can't afford him shwi at Southampton he's actually the Talisman of of Sal that's how poor sampton are he is their most attacking player he's won five fouls created Five chances um but his minutes were expected goal and moments every 284 minutes I'm not going to go there um sampton H I'm just looking at the fixtures here yeah sampton have IP switch as well so it's not a game I can particularly guess really two promoted sides Luca Dean Aston Villa is intriguing although he did start in the Champions League so that places a slight question mark over will he start at the weekend I'm sure he will but he might not um but yeah I ordinarily I would go for that Luca Dean um uh home to uh wolves um in game week five um but yeah he's won three fouls created Five chances um Corners taken six corners and he's got a couple of assists already so I think he's quite good uh parro's next in the list I've already got him but I put him in there you know if you if you're watching or listening and you you don't have him porro at home to brenford I think he has been um very good so far this season I I hope he survives in my wild card he may or may not um just because of price uh but he's created 10 chances um he has of course got his goal and no assists um but with winning seven fouls got a shot Inside the Box um you know these are quite good attacking uh defensive attacking um stats for a Defender um Mitchell at Crystal Palace he's the one that's getting away because everyone going for Muno uh first off in the season they're sort of ignoring Mitchell who's been doing better um yeah so he's got an assist shots Inside the Box three um to moono is two um and he's won a couple of fouls as well he created eight chances Munos has created four so if I was going for an attacking Crystal Palace Defender I would go for Mitchell he's down down to 4.9 I think he's a better bet um next up is Robertson he's the one I'm going to get mainly because bouth um against Liverpool against Bournemouth I think is the best fixture of the week um there's a chance very strong chance of a clean sheet also strong chance of attacking returns because he's taking 14 Corners in the Champions League League this week um who were the scorers and who were involved in the goals um well it was both their fullbacks and both their Center back scored so Alexander Arnold and Simas were providers for canate and Van djk um so that was good I'm not sure that's going to happen again um but it does does fill me with confidence about the way they play but the fact he's on 14 Corners creates six chances um and that three clean sheets already of course he didn't get it against Nan forest and a couple of shots inside the box so Robert is the one for me um Le Davis at ipswitch 4.5 he's actually the Talisman of ipswitch although they have the worst attacking stats of any team so far this but he has won five fouls he has created four chances Tak Seven Corners he's got an assist already um if I didn't get Robertson I might be tempted just to take a onewe punt on Leaf Davis as a sort of an audition possibly for being in my Wild Card side side um yeah cuz he's got sampton away and five but from game week six Aston Villa that's a bit well I mean obviously they all going to be tough matches for for IP switch because they don't attack much and they're you know newly promoted but nevertheless they're okay fixtures Aston villea at home West Ham away Everton at home brenford away Leicester at home Tottenham away gameweek 11 so the Run of fixtures is quite strong there so I'm you know I'm quite tempted I'm tempted mun as I said I'm not attempted because Mitchell's the one I think and I've just read out his stats and the other player is Lewis dunk he is another player I could get in as well so I I've got baros still in my team um he is my third Brighton player because I've got Pedro um and um Mina as well so if I wanted to get dunk um at home to n Forest I mean that has been even under derer that's been nil nil um and we lost to them um at nding Forest so I think Lewis dunk he's gone up to 4.6 now shots inside box one FS one two um he does take a free kick or two every now and again created four chances so far um obviously his Min expected golden B is very very low it's the worst out of any of these ones I mentioned all of those I've mentioned have all had a minimum of four chances created so a minimum of a chance a game and they've have a minimum of four starts so they're reliable starters um which could even extend to Luca Dean there so there's some there's some good options there that's been of interest um there so I'll just go back to my gameweek five um Team just so people can see there so it's really J Pedro's Fitness is the key for me I might go there I'm okay playing Robinson but I would like Robinson on the bench I would like Robertson um but as I said Leaf Davis um or Luca Dean could be a onewe punt there I'm not afraid to take those one week punts at the moment um I I see transfers as both a hindrance and a help um so uh I know I did fbl General show he had three transfers I think he did do that Gabrielle to Robertson move which is exactly what I would have done uh if I had three transfers and he indeed said you know he he didn't like it when he has two transfers when he has three it was you know fills him with Dread um uh okay um I'm going to put on my early game week six plans as well so as I said I'm going to look into wild card game week six um so I showed you last week if you're watching or listening last week um was basically this team um but I had havit as a third Arsenal player alongside Gabrielle and sacka and I had wher in for brenford so there's been some changes I've also taken the opportunity to sort of play around a little bit with this so um okay current current my current thinking for game week six I've got a tiny bit in the bank as a bit of ballast for this or 04 or something I've got reaya in goal so he is my third Arsenal and I've gone for an Arsenal defensive double up now they do have City in gameweek five but this is from gameweek six got Leicester sampton Bournemouth and then they got this tough run Liverpool Newcastle Chelsea but we saw um in their last game you know just how how strong they can be again like for for example against an attacking side like Tottenham um where set pieces could be key and they could get a clean sheet as well so I don't mind that that Arsenal double up even in tough fixtures anyway uh I've got enough to get Alexander Arnold as well and he is my sole Liverpool player at the moment I think why not go for the best if I can um so I've got Raya and I've got Robinson as well um he has stayed in Fulham I think he's pretty good value he's gone up to 4.6 um uh fulham's fixtures they duvail quite nicely with Spurs which is quite um good to know Robinson um has got not Nan Forest away so I'm happy to play him uh van Deen or porro um on the bench and they they they um help each other out with rotation very nicely so Fulham I could play uh Robinson game we six no problem gamix S I wouldn't want to play him because he plays Man City but then I have a look at Spurs and game seven they got Brighton so I prefer to play a Spurs Defender then um and then Fulham they've got pretty nice okay fix got Villa at home game week eight uh Everton away brenford at home Crystal Palace away and Spurs as well um have pretty good fixtures um from gameweek um well gameweek five onwards you know including ipswitch uh West Ham Crystal Palace in that mix as well so I'm happy to play either of them really uh which is good it gives you choices as well okay so that's my defense uh I've got Brian bomo I think you know well you know he is U the one to get at the moment for brenford he is their Talisman sacka he is the Talisman for Arsenal um pretty nailed on and he'll be my captain at home to Leicester Bowen and once again a Talisman you see the theme here I'm going for Talisman in teams that don't maybe even if they've got Champions League commitments they're pretty nailed on most of the time so Bowen doesn't have that commitments so I like him West Ham's pictures are pretty good um from game week six uh just having a look at there brenford ips switch Tottenham Manchester United nding for Everton for the next few fixtures pretty good seeno uh once again the Talisman for Bournemouth and they don't have um any um cup commitments there um I think seeno at home to sampton pretty good um and he rotates quite nicely with Rogers who is also on my team on the bench up front I've gone for salanki instead of havs because I don't I can't get four Arsenal players in harl he's back in uh well say back in he's never left he's there uh away to Newcastle but then from gaming seven at home to Fulham is you know good run continues and I've gone for Chris Woods instead of wher um so I was having a look Alternatives I've done two two other videos this week one with FPL General um and one with Tom Freeman and both of them had a very of a theme of like they've got um problems with their forwards you know which which ones to get um so you can take sort of um punts on players like calber Leen or vardy um but I just look like Nan Forest fixtures are pretty good they got um they got fullham at home um game week um gameweek six um so I just looking at man City's fixtures for game Sorry game week I I I think I may have said that man city had fham in game week six fham man city have full in game week seven that's when their good run um continues yeah so anyway so with with Fulham they got Noam Forest so Woods against Fulham okay I'm pretty happy with that at home as well and but then he got Chelsea away Crystal Palace at home Leicester away West Ham West Ham at home Newcastle at home you see what they did to Li Liverpool as well so I just think go for sort of tried and tested player also I'd like kuna from sort of gameweek 10 onwards and so Chris Woods a sort of a holding player for kuna and kuna is 6.5 I think he'll be popular as well from then because wol fixtures about game week 10 they're good right up until sort of Boxing Day New Year's daytime um so kuna would be very good there strand lson is another player to consider uh on my bench I've got fabianski uh Rogers as I said rotates quite nicely with seeno I think um uh I tentatively uh looked at that um but I just think basically ason vill features are pretty good until game week 11 when they've got Al gameing 101 when they got Tottenham Liverpool um I've got van Deen I'd like him to be porro though and if I can afford him I would uh and my Scarrow so I'm I'm getting ahead for game week s 10 with a wolves uh Defender he's just third on the bench I've bet barco is my third bench I've never had to go to the third bench you so you won a 4.0 and uh you know he's playing in wolves and wolves as I said fixtures game 10 are really really good um so I've got up on the screen the big question for me is HZ versus reyer so I could have reyer Gabrielle sacka um or and that ryer Gabriel sacka and a player like salanki um that's about as much as I can I can't afford Watkins for example um but if I didn't do that I would have havitz instead of RAR as my third Arsenal player um and in goal I would have for buan and fleen who rotate really really well really brilliantly brenford a really great fixtures right up until um uh gameweek 12 I think it is and it's gameweek 12 when Brighton's fixtures get really good so um that's absolutely perfect so I might do that that actually saves me 0.5 as well which means I can get salanki up to havitz uh with this team more or less um barring any other price changes so I like that as well and I might go with that one more I mean whilst you know the thought of having that Arsenal defensive double up that gives you that slight Edge because you know most people are going to have an Arsenal Defender from game six I think probably Gabrielle so having Ry as well will help but I do think there's a lot of clean sheet possibility for fleen and verban which um I'd like to get there and I I'm not wholly sold on sanki whereas havitz I just feel could be a really great great option I think he's obviously the main man up front uh for Arsenal and Arsenal I think it's going to be between Arsenal and City probably for the title this year you would think they're the best two sides Liverpool might have a say on that as well um yeah so that's my thoughts there I put um the the rating I've done used the planning tool on the app Fantasy Football Scout um I'm expected points this week of 58 and it's a 97% uh rating and whether I go for havit or RAB whichever those they're still pretty strong and they're pretty strong last week I showed sort of my um my w my ward how it would pan out future game weeks and it's pretty strong so um yeah that's what I'm looking for so game week five really I'm yeah just I'm just waiting for game we I'm waiting to press the button on Saturday um for that um but nevertheless yeah hope hope that was um of use there a bit of bit of a rambling one this week but as I said so gameweek five is sort of a nothing key game week for me um where I was just sort of cover myself with the Liverpool defense probably um or might take a you know one we punt on one of those Strikers I don't want longterm um but um yeah I hope that was help um just remind do press that like button and do remember to subscribe keep update with our latest videos and podcasts um good luck with game

most attacking defenders which will help my decisions ill also look at what was good game week four for me and i hope that continues into game week five probably wishful thinking plus ill reveal the latest in my gw six wild card ear wild card early plans especially what to do with a spot i had reserved for wiissa but who is now absent from for injury for another two months before we do that just

you keep up to date with our latest videos and podcasts as well okay lets have a look at game week four see how that was for me i got 61 points which was about 10 over the average which in a in a week where many people had quite a poor week 61 i feel quite happy with that because harlem was the main one for most people including myself got 26 points as my captain and it was a whole se of ones and twos for everyone else so if you owned like one or two players who just did anything else you had a good game week so i was 12m in the rankings before the arsenal game on sunday i was about 11m little green arrow but gabrielles goal for me and clean sheet that propel me up to 790k which is great so i had henderson a porro robinson all ones and two points gabrielle 15 points thats the difference mina did didnt do anything for me gordon not for one of trying didnt do anything dieo jotter came off at 59 minutes annoyingly 8c short of if hed have walked a bit faster that would have been good walked a bit slower rather that would have been good for me mo salalah who was new in for me he got two points smith row came off the bench for me for j pedro who was also new in so effectively so i move saaka and isach to salah and pedro which would have i think i would have just broken even with that like no i would have got no i would have been down for that because sacka got an assist but because smith row came in i ended that particular move one point up and im much happier going into gw five with salah and pedro if hes fit rather than sacka he faces man city and has an injury as far as we know at the moment im recording this on wednesday morning i believe this is going out first and thursday so we may have had some extra news about that isak as well is currently an injury doubt as well apparently had double vision after face sure head injury during the game which he was substituted last time out so im im okay with that im okay with that move so it was for two frees as well so didnt cost me anything munes got me one point he was replaced by jimnez annoyingly munez was in league cup action i didnt do anything despite almost everyone scoring multiple penalties in their penalty shoot out but so munes i think it was without penalty yes munes sadly didnt do anything for me harland that 26 points on my bench absolute zeros barker zero quona zero pedro zero fabianski zero whole sea of zeros there so im im okay with that im im not im not like whoopy whoop with my 61 points because ive re realized that its a team i think that needs wild carding because the fixtures do change in game week six quite a lot im not set up for that im just tired theres players ive got mina not doing it he is young still could be a good option but i dont think he is at the moment and the fixtur stiffen for brighton from gw six gordons okay but im happy to lose him as well munz has lost his plays possibly and hes just not the player i thought he was going to be sacka is a miss now so id like him back for game week six i think smith row probably be the only player i might move on that with a with a with a hany to my eyes as a little tear forms because i think hes a good option i may end up just keeping him but the rest of him can just go i reckon so not a its okay im good score but masking issues here so im going to put my gw five team up so as i said im going to wild card in game week six i just have that one free transfer so ill read out my team and ill explain what ill probably be doing depending on different scenarios which by the time you watch this you may know more of course theres league cup action during the we wednesday night so im calling this before that also some more champions league games as well so im currently going into this with henderson in goal home to man utd its okay not great pedro por home to brenford im okay with that gabrielle away to man city im just not going to bench gabrielle now because especially in these tougher games what are arsenal good at set pieces so if theyre going to get anything from this game its going to be a set piece of course they could even get a clean sheet from this arsenal defense is pretty good but he is against harland so somebodys got a give i think if i field harland and gabriel im hedging my bets a bit robinson at home to newcastle ill explain more i prefer him to be my first sub rather than in my team ive got minter at home to ningan forest give him another go if he gets benched im okay with him coming on in fact i probably prefer that because he might be a bit more spurred up to do something gordon way to fulham okay with that diego j at home to bournemouth im imin okay with that although he did start in the champions league although he didnt score dar nunes came on and didnt impress all and i thought they were a bit better with jotter in the side as well salah captain home to bournemouth very happy with that well i say that now smith r at home to newcastle im just going to play him now for it could be his final game for me harlands my vice captain at home to arsenal and j pedro if fit home to nan forest why not we will know more because there will be the brighton manager will be discussing pedros fitness before brighton have their league cup game tonight of which you wouldnt expect pedro to play that anyway but his availability for it is of interest so he could be on the bench for example the manager could say hes fine im not playing him here because its just league cup i dont know but we might get some definite or he might say look hes hes just got to be out for a couple of weeks ive got on my bench ive got fabianski u munes is my first sub currently but if hes only going to get a minute and hes at home to newcast i quona is still there somehow barco is still there somehow as well so my plan moves are is pretty much defense is a problem i would prefer to get robinson as my first sub rather than mooners because i just feel he might get an assist they could even keep a clean sheet especially if isach is out but i think id prefer robinson as a a good bench option i dont fancy him in my main 11 so what i would i ideally like to do is the move that i was talking about last week which was quansa out for robertson so i was going to i thought i might have to make that move early this week because quans price would go down robertsons price would go up but robertsons price hasnt gone up because liverpool didnt get a clean sheet last time out so people dont like that the hes on about on all the statistics sites hes on i think about 40 chance of going up at the moment 40 on the way to going up and quons 30 on to go down so i think if i can survive until friday afternoon for this ill about to make that move ive got exact money to do quaner to robertson at the moment and so robertson would come in for robinson would dip down onto the bench there thats thats probably my most sensible move but if pedro is definitely out so if pedro is like a out ill just play him and just hope my bench come on smith row came on last week so just got to trust in the bench but if pedros definitely out i can move munz because ive got 18m in the bank this the coner to robertson money i can move munz to someone like well i can go up to salanki at home to brenford i quite like that i could go for one we punt on vardy as well im okay with that against everton calvi leen is ill at the moment he might have been in my thoughts because im wild c in game week six im im tempted to use that transfer now other people will say i see this a lot because we can save these five transfers this season i see lots of people going for this saving five transfers saving transfers saving transfers but a lot of the teams im seeing players managers doing that theyre not doing so well because i think you still need to use transfers to addressed the game week at hand and also last week so i had two free transfers i moved salah is salah and pedro in for isach and sacka if id have had three free transfers i would have removed gabrielle to robertson i definitely would have done that move and many people did and i would have been i would have been well what ever robinson got two points i would have been 13 points down so that extra transfer would have cost me so you got to bear in mind these kinds of things a transfer can also cost you points as well as get you points and also longterm i dont think that would be a good move so anyway so what ill do is im quite happy to take im still do that traditional strategy of im going to wild card ill take a onee pump beforehand because looking at my team ill put my gw six wild card team up in a sec but looking at that whichever pattern i go with im pretty happy with that for a good few weeks and i dont think im going to have to make that many changes so bit im going to hopefully build up transfers that way but if i need to make a transfer i will i think was it i think it was mark sn on one of one of his blackbox videos was saying similar about that he felt that people would see that as an opportunity with the ch the rule change to save transfers up to five and they carry through wild cards to do that and they would miss out then on opportunities and i do think that is the case and i think this week is an opportunity with a lot of say for example the likes of vardy theyve got good fixtures this week and you dont want them long term perfect for a onewe punt i remember ive done that before with players perhaps when stoke were in the premier league i might go well ill go for a stoke midfielder i dont want them long term for one week so but i think rob robertson is my key one so on that note im going to ive got a table ive done from the fancy football scout members area looking at attacking defenders and ive sorted this by minutes per expected goal involvement theyre defenders theyre not going to be huge theyre good but nevertheless ive got l lots of other metrics here so i was just stress testing my decision there for robertson fairly confident ill about to do that there may be an unexpected price change in which case ill be locked out with that and then i dont know what im going to do i will go for an alternative defender i think possibly or i might go for that munes to someone like vardy move or salanki but anyway here is the list of defenders top understandably is alexander arnold but he cost 7m so im locked out of that i cant do that if you can or its already on your team you should feel lucky hes created 11 chances taken 12 corners and his minutes per baseline bonus is strong hes racking up one of these baseline bonus every 64 minutes which is very strong sorry i was just taking a sip of water if you were listening to that on the podcast version and just heard a gulp and some silence hes had no assists so he should do i suspect hes going to be on this simant table on the podcast that i do with mark joblin every week so listen out for that so alexander would be the one to get i cant afford him shwi at southampton hes the talisman of sal thats how poor sampton are he is their most attacking player hes won five fouls created five chances but his minutes were expected goal and moments every 284 minutes im not going to go there sampton h im just looking at the fixtures here sampton have ip switch as well so its not a game i can particularly guess two promoted sides luca dean aston villa is intriguing although he did start in the champions league so that places a slight question mark over will he start at the weekend im sure he will but he might not but i ordinarily i would go for that luca dean home to wolves in game week five but hes won three fouls created five chances corners taken six corners and hes got a couple of assists already so i think hes quite good parros next in the list ive already got him but i put him in there if you if youre watching or listening and you dont have him porro at home to brenford i think he has been very good so far this season i hope he survives in my wild card he may or may not just because of price but hes created 10 chances he has of course got his goal and no assists but with winning seven fouls got a shot inside the box these are quite good attacking defensive attacking stats for a defender mitchell at crystal palace hes the one thats getting away because everyone going for muno first off in the season theyre ignoring mitchell whos been doing better so hes got an assist shots inside the box three to moono is two and hes won a couple of fouls as well he created eight chances munos has created four so if i was going for an attacking crystal palace defender i would go for mitchell hes down to 49 i think hes a better bet next up is robertson hes the one im going to get mainly because bouth against liverpool against bournemouth i think is the best fixture of the week theres a chance very strong chance of a clean sheet also strong chance of attacking returns because hes taking 14 corners in the champions league this week who were the scorers and who were involved in the goals well it was both their fullbacks and both their center back scored so alexander arnold and simas were providers for canate and van djk so that was good im not sure thats going to happen again but it does fill me with confidence about the way they play but the fact hes on 14 corners creates six chances and that three clean sheets already of course he didnt get it against nan forest and a couple of shots inside the box so robert is the one for me le davis at ipswitch 45 hes the talisman of ipswitch although they have the worst attacking stats of any team so far this but he has won five fouls he has created four chances tak seven corners hes got an assist already if i didnt get robertson i might be tempted just to take a onewe punt on leaf davis as a an audition possibly for being in my wild card side cuz hes got sampton away and five but from game week six aston villa thats a bit well they all going to be tough matches for ip switch because they dont attack much and theyre newly promoted but nevertheless theyre okay fixtures aston villea at home west ham away everton at home brenford away leicester at home tottenham away gw 11 so the run of fixtures is quite strong there so im im quite tempted im tempted mun as i said im not attempted because mitchells the one i think and ive just read out his stats and the other player is lewis dunk he is another player i could get in as well so ive got baros still in my team he is my third brighton player because ive got pedro and mina as well so if i wanted to get dunk at home to n forest that has been even under derer thats been nil and we lost to them at nding forest so i think lewis dunk hes gone up to 46 now shots inside box one fs one two he does take a free kick or two every now and again created four chances so far his min expected golden b is very low its the worst out of any of these ones i mentioned all of those ive mentioned have all had a minimum of four chances created so a minimum of a chance a game and theyve have a minimum of four starts so theyre reliable starters which could even extend to luca dean there so theres some theres some good options there thats been of interest there so ill just go back to my gw five team just so people can see there so its j pedros fitness is the key for me i might go there im okay playing robinson but i would like robinson on the bench i would like robertson but as i said leaf davis or luca dean could be a onewe punt there im not afraid to take those one week punts at the moment i see transfers as both a hindrance and a help so i know i did fbl general show he had three transfers i think he did do that gabrielle to robertson move which is exactly what i would have done if i had three transfers and he indeed said he didnt like it when he has two transfers when he has three it was fills him with dread okay im going to put on my early game week six plans as well so as i said im going to look into wild card game week six so i showed you last week if youre watching or listening last week was this team but i had havit as a third arsenal player alongside gabrielle and sacka and i had wher in for brenford so theres been some changes ive also taken the opportunity to play around a little bit with this so okay current my current thinking for game week six ive got a tiny bit in the bank as a bit of ballast for this or 04 ive got reaya in goal so he is my third arsenal and ive gone for an arsenal defensive double up now they do have city in gw five but this is from gw six got leicester sampton bournemouth and then they got this tough run liverpool newcastle chelsea but we saw in their last game just how strong they can be again like for example against an attacking side like tottenham where set pieces could be key and they could get a clean sheet as well so i dont mind that arsenal double up even in tough fixtures anyway ive got enough to get alexander arnold as well and he is my sole liverpool player at the moment i think why not go for the best if i can so ive got raya and ive got robinson as well he has stayed in fulham i think hes pretty good value hes gone up to 46 fulhams fixtures they duvail quite nicely with spurs which is quite good to know robinson has got not nan forest away so im happy to play him van deen or porro on the bench and they help each other out with rotation very nicely so fulham i could play robinson game we six no problem gamix s i wouldnt want to play him because he plays man city but then i have a look at spurs and game seven they got brighton so i prefer to play a spurs defender then and then fulham theyve got pretty nice okay fix got villa at home game week eight everton away brenford at home crystal palace away and spurs as well have pretty good fixtures from gw well gw five onwards including ipswitch west ham crystal palace in that mix as well so im happy to play either of them which is good it gives you choices as well okay so thats my defense ive got brian bomo i think well he is u the one to get at the moment for brenford he is their talisman sacka he is the talisman for arsenal pretty nailed on and hell be my captain at home to leicester bowen and once again a talisman you see the theme here im going for talisman in teams that dont maybe even if theyve got champions league commitments theyre pretty nailed on most of the time so bowen doesnt have that commitments so i like him west hams pictures are pretty good from game week six just having a look at there brenford ips switch tottenham man utd nding for everton for the next few fixtures pretty good seeno once again the talisman for bournemouth and they dont have any cup commitments there i think seeno at home to sampton pretty good and he rotates quite nicely with rogers who is also on my team on the bench up front ive gone for salanki instead of havs because i dont i cant get four arsenal players in harl hes back in well say back in hes never left hes there away to newcastle but then from gaming seven at home to fulham is good run continues and ive gone for chris woods instead of wher so i was having a look alternatives ive done two other videos this week one with fpl general and one with tom freeman and both of them had a very of a theme of like theyve got problems with their forwards which ones to get so you can take punts on players like calber leen or vardy but i just look like nan forest fixtures are pretty good they got they got fullham at home game week gw six so i just looking at man citys fixtures for game sorry game week i think i may have said that man city had fham in game week six fham man city have full in game week seven thats when their good run continues so anyway so with fulham they got noam forest so woods against fulham okay im pretty happy with that at home as well and but then he got chelsea away crystal palace at home leicester away west ham west ham at home newcastle at home you see what they did to li liverpool as well so i just think go for tried and tested player also id like kuna from gw 10 onwards and so chris woods a a holding player for kuna and kuna is 65 i think hell be popular as well from then because wol fixtures about game week 10 theyre good right up until boxing day new years daytime so kuna would be very good there strand lson is another player to consider on my bench ive got fabianski rogers as i said rotates quite nicely with seeno i think i tentatively looked at that but i just think ason vill features are pretty good until game week 11 when theyve got al gameing 101 when they got tottenham liverpool ive got van deen id like him to be porro though and if i can afford him i would and my scarrow so im im getting ahead for game week s 10 with a wolves defender hes just third on the bench ive bet barco is my third bench ive never had to go to the third bench you so you won a 40 and hes playing in wolves and wolves as i said fixtures game 10 are good so ive got up on the screen the big question for me is hz versus reyer so i could have reyer gabrielle sacka or and that ryer gabriel sacka and a player like salanki thats about as much as i can i cant afford watkins for example but if i didnt do that i would have havitz instead of rar as my third arsenal player and in goal i would have for buan and fleen who rotate well brilliantly brenford a great fixtures right up until gw 12 i think it is and its gw 12 when brightons fixtures get good so thats absolutely perfect so i might do that saves me 05 as well which means i can get salanki up to havitz with this team more or less barring any other price changes so i like that as well and i might go with that one more whilst the thought of having that arsenal defensive double up that gives you that slight edge because most people are going to have an arsenal defender from game six i think probably gabrielle so having ry as well will help but i do think theres a lot of clean sheet possibility for fleen and verban which id like to get there and im not wholly sold on sanki whereas havitz i just feel could be a great option i think hes the main man up front for arsenal and arsenal i think its going to be between arsenal and city probably for the title this year you would think theyre the best two sides liverpool might have a say on that as well so thats my thoughts there i put the rating ive done used the planning tool on the app fantasy football scout im expected points this week of 58 and its a 97 rating and whether i go for havit or rab whichever those theyre still pretty strong and theyre pretty strong last week i showed my my w my ward how it would pan out future game weeks and its pretty strong so thats what im looking for so game week five im just im just waiting for game we im waiting to press the button on saturday for that but nevertheless hope that was of use there a bit of bit of a rambling one this week but as i said so gw five is a nothing key game week for me where i was just cover myself with the liverpool defense probably or might take a one we punt on one of those strikers i dont want longterm but i hope that was help just remind do press that like button and do remember to subscribe keep update with our latest videos and podcasts good luck with game with five see you soon,4879

podcast from fancy Football Scout my name is Joe and today I'm joined by Fantasy Football Scout Deputy editor Tom Freeman and friend to have a look at his game week five team welcome Tom how are you yeah I'm good thanks Jo yeah we've got an addition here this is Peggy say hello everybody so she came came and sat on my lap at the precise time we're about to start recording so I'm hoping she's I'm going to put her down now yeah yeah the whole show he's gonna hopefully just go into the corner and remain nice and quiet so good girl Peggy and we'll see how we get on but um yeah I'm good thanks Joe yeah um poor game week four like a lot of people I think but um Villa and Champions League action a bit later on so I can't be too can't be too down beat so rolling back the years it's going to feel like 1982 again um I have got the right year hav't I yeah it is 1982 yeah it was the year I was born actually yeah so I I can't forget that one so I imagine there were a lot of babies born um in the Burmingham area that year um okay um so what we're going to do today we're going to have a look at Tom's uh gameweek four uh team as he said it didn't go so well so we'll won't Linger on that too long um we're gonna have a special focus on budget Strikers um because lots are interested in them people are while kind of game EX six can take a punt in game week five and there's also lots of options as well lots of players losing their places uh injuries Etc um and of course we'll look at uh Tom's gameweek five plans as well um just a reminder do uh do check out the members are at Fantasy Football Scout any stats we show Here season ticket Etc they're all on there so you can uh do do have a look at the members area at Fantasy Football Scout um you can uh make your own tables all those kinds of things also please do subscribe um and like um the sub subscribing is really good because you can keep updated with our latest videos and podcasts as well um okay let's have a look uh let's get straight into game week four um I've got a picture of of a confused looking aay um next to your team um so yeah you've got 41 points and it's a bit of a red arrow down to three million so um yeah do you want to just quickly run through your team who your who your star is talk about some of the others yeah I mean it's Harland and 10 others isn't it really but um so from Back to Front we've had um Henderson in goal um I'm not going to say how many points they got because everybody was one or two um but we had Henderson in goal Alexander Arnold conza and Robinson at the back um Salah Mina e and Rogers in Midfield and then monitz har and Captain and isack up front on the bench Bentley Smith row who who did return but but did didn't come into my team like he did for quite a few others due to J Pedro but he's rooted to the bench in my setup and then porro and Quanza as well okay so you're are you are you heading for a gameweek six wild card is that your plan or are you thinking at afterwards or well that's always been the plan but when we bring up my team and have a look in a bit um for next week and um I'm not totally convinced if it's if it's going to be worth it because I think I can get to quite a similar team which I'd want a wild card to with maybe a minus four maybe even without a hit so I'm still kind of I may well press the button I'm just kind of I'm 5050 at the moment um but the team looked good on paper last week you know I think we sat here and did our video Joe and lots of Home fixtures lots of positivity I said you were you you were one or two steps ahead of me yeah yeah I definitely wasn't so um but yeah the players just didn't turn up um just blank blanks abs Ely everywhere I mean Robinson lost that clean sheet so late on um and then yeah you know I've got you know I've got 20 million invested in Liverpool players and they got three points between them um I took sacka out for Salah like a lot of people did so I'm five points down with that started monit over Smith row he was Bench oh yeah it was just one of those weeks where pretty much everything went wrong apart from Harland um who uh who at least kind of you know it was bad but at least I got the captaincy right and at least I could get 26 points via him yeah definitely I mean I see what you mean about your team as well because um you're not that invested in say Brighton for example uh who fixures turning game week six you can get a couple of Arsenal players as you said with a two freeze or a hit uh in game week six uh You' you've already got two Aston Villa they've got good fixtures continuing through game six and of course you get to keep Harland you don't have to get Harland and you've got Pedro porro who is very handy from game week five well well I don't have porro sorry sorry I do have porro I don't have sorry what I was gonna say I don't don't no no I was further ahead of you I was already thinking about my my moves for that but I could potent but I could potentially bring in onomo and say either Sack or an arsenal Defender with free transfers so I don't have B move kind of feels key in game week six but but I could bring them in in free transfers so do I need to Wild Card I'm not quite so sure yet okay um yeah okay so big big decisions we'll come to that game five in a sec okay what we're going to look at now is some um budget Strikers the reason we're doing that you've got munis in your side I have as well um I'm going to bench him next week because he's being benched at the moment um but we've also got some other issues well we've got some sort of emerging budget Strikers as well calv Le's doing well vard's rolling Back The Years getting returns um so there's there's options there as well there's some sort of teams with new Strikers as well Nikas emerged um as well as as a potential option um meanwhile potential injury to Pedro isak as well potential injury um it's there's a lot up in the air I mean I think like like me you're probably going to hold your transfer until the end of the week because we're can have more information then yeah that that esack eye injury feels key doesn't it if he were to miss it and like I think like you've got as well Joe you said you've got monit as well suddenly if if if isacks are doubt monit might not start we've got a bit of a problem so that's why we're kind of looking at this list just in case we need to react on Friday and wher who was a big Target um is is injured for two months um yeah I've got Pedro and munise um mun on the bench for me but and but I want to play Pedro but if we get the nod that he's like a a serious doubt by the end of the week then I will move to put Pedro perhaps uh you know just have a very a better first sub than moon is at the moment um okay let's have a look at some budget Strikers okay so what I've done is I've gone to the members area Fantasy Football Scout I have sorted this by minutes per expected goal involvement I've also included some stats like fouls one and shots on Target um because they are useful in terms of bonus points so you can see why a lot of Strikers are getting bonus points if they get a return this season I've also got the fixtures on the side for gameweek five which show that ipswitch have a favorable fixture against sampton as do sampton against ipswitch uh Everton against Leicester um is good for both of those sides as well Brighton's good little mini fixture run good fixture run continues with ning and Forest um Aston Villa home to wolves is good but um so could be an option there um um Chelsea way to West Ham Liverpool of course um home to B Bournemouth but um in terms of good fixtures there it's quite a good week for Budget Strikers Everton Ipswich sampton Bon Leicester they've all caught good fixtures um let's start with the top uh in terms of minutes per expected goal involvement uh every 98 minutes so pretty much a goal and moment the game expected to get um but he missed a penalty yes vansson at Bournemouth sort of salanki replacement he's only 5.9 he's won six six fouls been foul six times minut per shots on target every 67 minutes and started three times um I'm not quite I mean bournemouth's way to Liverpool is not the it's not the week to get him in but in future are you looking at him I think he could work but I think it depends when you wild card they've got two really good fixtures um after next week against the newly promoted clubs and then it turns bad again so you know if you were going to say wild card in eight you know that a move for Evan nelsson this week might make sense I actually quite like him and I think he is I think I think it's just a matter of time before he scores because there's a lot that he's doing right in that team um but maybe for somebody who's gonna well wild card in May maybe seven then there's a bit more doubt around him and you might get two better better fixtures from a few names further down the list yeah I mean currently seeno is the Talisman um in terms of expected goal involvement at Bournemouth um so that's one to monitor I think he would get the nod for me on a wild card in game week six but yeah um Ian Elson and the next place Wier I put him I've kept him in even though he's injured just just so people can sort of Benchmark uh the Alternatives against him um but they're pretty much on their own in terms of minutes per EXP expected goal and bowlman he's every 105 minutes and there's a big gap between him and the third place which is kuna who will come to in a sec um but um yeah EV nson his stats are really strong uh as good as as V's um so I am yeah I'm very very tempted by him but yeah thisa Big Miss big Miss minutes per shot on target every 71 minutes he had won fouls 11 fouls he won I mean he's just he's just dripping in bonus points and goals and for close range efforts yeah it's a sh it's a shame I mean I think sh's probably going to come in for him who's obviously that you know he's the midfielder could be good but that isn't going to help you if you've got wizer and you need to make a change to a forward definitely um now kuna is in interests me a lot um he is next placed on here minutes per expected goal involvement every 142 minutes shots on target as strong so but they're not sort of get generating the expected stats but minutes per shot on target every 56 minutes he's won8 fouls he's 6.5 so he's a little bit more expensive but 65 Still Still cheap um trouble is he's way to Aston Villa this week and the fixtures don't turn I think it's until gameweek nine yeah but for those who think far ahead or I I've definitely got Kuna in mind for gameweek nine but he's just not yet yeah I'm the same I actually like stran Larson as well from wolves who's been million cheaper but has had a couple of attacking returns so far and I thought they were a bit unlucky against Newcastle at the weekend I think that game could have gone either way and K is a good option but yeah gameweek n perhaps even they go to Brighton I think in game week nine don't they so so it might even be game week 10 dependent on how Brighton looked them but I think Villa Liverpool brenford City it's a tough run isn't it and wolves aren't playing they're not getting good results at the moment they're in a bit of a slump under Gary O'Neal so I think that that is probably a wait and see I think yeah definitely um perhaps nor wait Andy though he fourth place on it it's ntia um so he's emerged from Arsenal I mean a former hattrick Hero at Arsenal so we know he's got the quality and we've seen the quality from Arsenal players going to other teams look at Smith r at Fulham um so Nika Crystal Palace is 5.9 um one just one a couple of f just one that one start but his expected goal involvement is is 57 minutes so um promising there um and the fixture is okay um against Manchester United but it's at home um is you know cuz he's former Arsenal it's I I just I just feel that he I could be I could be very tempted um obviously mata's more but if I had the if I couldn't afford mateta who is on sharing penalty duties with e NTI I think he's worth a go yeah I think so too Joe I think he he had six shots in his debut on Saturday which is twice as many as vard he's had across the whole season yeah so that that's kind of quite encouraging I think he T had some like 15 Penalty Box touches which are the most in the game week among forwards as well his his positioning is quite interesting because glasner is playing this 3421 and he's kind of taken up that Alis position from last year where he's a little bit withdrawn on the right so he's not like the focal point like mateta but he's 5.9 million so you you know you've got to take that into account and I think he could do pretty well I think I'd probably I would take him above vardy um I might probably put cvin Le and who were going to come on to him minute slightly ahead yeah because he's got penalties and and Keo won't have but it's I think he's one of the better options on this list for sure definitely and next one next one is Welbeck um now I think welbeck's one to consider if you are wild card in six and you just want to take a punt on he I he's a very reliable starter at the moment I can't see him not starting um is Pedro we don't know about at the moment we assume it seems to be precautionary um but we don't know whether that precautionary is going to extend into the next game week which would be annoying because game week four and five exactly when we want a Brighton player but well be at 5.7 um uh minutes per shot on target every 83 minutes minutes per expected goal involement 87 minutes so he's fourth no four 1 two three four sorry he's fifth in this in this table um terms of budget options um yeah yeah I think long longer term Joe what what is is his minutes going to decline do you think or do you is hard to say or it's hard to say at the moment because arguably he's looked in better shape than he was when he was at like Manchester United and yeah and you know bigger bigger teams um so he's arguably a better player now and you know I I I I think I was I don't know if it was on this show or was it um FBI generals last week where I was saying I saw I saw the briyan game I saw last season before last against Liverpool and he he did a pesque goal and and people like laughing uh in the the chat and I was saying well you have a look have a look have a look for yourself you know just key in to YouTube you know wellbe wonder goal Liverpool and you'll see it um and I think he's yeah I think he's a really great option the problem is is there fixes stiffen from gameweek six yeah um so he's a real onewe plan if you haven't already got him but but if you you're sitting with well Beck in your team then take heart keep yeah take heart from this um next option is Chris Woods um who I was going to get Rista on my wild cards I've sort of kept kept that sort of budget and I think I might get Chris Wood I've always liked um Chris Wood and so because he's just reliable um yeah even if he's coming off the bench or you know he's only getting 60 minutes he doesn't need many shots he's so experienced minutes per shot on target every 44 minutes which is great minutes per expected goal involvement every 188 minutes um which places him just um below Welbeck and above Cal lean here um yeah I like chriswood um Nan Forest I mean I mean obviously they put put Liverpool to the sword so yeah I think yeah I think he's just he's he's he's the boring pick but he's probably the best yeah that that it it does seem to be that way a bit he's not being spoken about that much but if you look at his record under Nuno he deserves to be because he's been consistently good under him um scoring a lot of goals and the fixtures for Forest are okay I mean they've got Brighton but then they got Fulham at home they got Alice at home who haven't looked you know particularly tight this season um and then after that what have you got you got Leicester so yeah I think that probably is an argument there was a bit of talk earlier in the season about how on eh he and how he would impact his minutes but that hasn't really come to fruition too much yet and wood feels like First Choice there so um yeah they look good Forest under Nuno this year don't they so um yeah again put him in put him on the watch list definitely yeah another reason I like him I I did some uh a table for f General show uh so do have a look at that or or listen to that if you're listening to the podcast version um in which we look to the most attacking teams but crucially who they're most who their Talisman is who who is gobbling up the expected goal involvement um and interest ly for for a lot of these teams it's not the budget strike or it's not the striker that we're looking for so Bournemouth it's um um looking down the list here if I can SEO is um seeno yeah I'm just trying to yeah yeah seeno um he's just taking so many shots yeah yeah seeno not I nson um wo it is kuna that's why I'm very interesting him but Crystal Palace is obviously not aeter yet um and at Brighton it's not Welbeck and it's not Pedro it's matoma is actually the guy most likely but at ninghan Forest it is chriswood so that's what appeals to him if I think n Forest is going to score it's more than likely to be him um yeah yeah absolutely for the next L Calvin Leen very intriguing uh because I think we've often said you know if fit he's a good option and he he does appear to be injuryf free but he is also not the Talisman for Everton Everton are the third worst team in terms of attacking teams so far this season and it's mcneel with um expected goal involvement of 1.63 um but um yeah so it's not Cal nevertheless minutes per expected goal involvement every 196 minutes um uh minutes per shot on target every 160 minutes so they're not not great stats but nevertheless um you know he is an experienced clinical Striker who is injury free I think a lot of people will be interested in him I think because they're playing Leicester yeah and I think mcneel creates a lot but I think in terms of who's going to score the goals if Everton are going to turn a bit of a corner they they've scored four in the past two weeks I know they've lost both games but they've scored a few I think it is probably going to be him I get why people will be skeptical because he was massively under underachieved last year terms of his XG I think his XG Delta was was was higher than Darwin Nunes um but he finished strongly I think he scored four in his last seven last year and he's kind of taken that form into this season three attacking returns in four game weeks he's got penalties and I think the appeal is those fixtures isn't it Joe he's got he take he go he's got all three of the newly promoted clubs in the next six game weeks all way but but he is playing them and then you've got some okayish fixtures at goodison Park and so I I would probably I would probably take him over any of the other forwards on this list given those fixtures I think I think especially if you're not wild carding in gameweek six he's a great option because as you said he his next he's top of the fixture ticker Everton are right up until gameweek 11 with all of those great fixtures Yeah you mentioned um so yeah I mean that's that's why tempted someone like me who's Walky in six if I was going to take a punt I can possibly gowhere but yeah I think he is a good he's a good option this week good option coming up um Sor yeah he sorry I was say he was a handful against Villa on Saturday yeah I mean he he really should have put that game to bed when it was two one I think and then he missed he hit the bar as well so he's getting chances and he's up against good Defenders like kza and so he's I yeah I don't mind that yeah I wonder with with Everton with branway back if well if he is back this weekend which he does look like could be um then I I mean they can't I mean for a team to lose to be two nil up and then lose 3-2 for for the second game we a row that's that's really poor that's really poor yeah um they're just I mean I watched the game with a couple of Everton fans and even at 2-0 up they're not confident at all and they were all saying this will this will finish 32 and and it happened and it and they they need brwi next to tarkowski they've got problems at fullback but I think it will improve for Everton but they need to start getting some key players in um vard's next in the list um he's only 5.7 I think he's just gone up actually um but um yeah I mean he's obviously not the vardy of 2016 but is he Now 37 I think so um but m every 107 minutes expected goal involvement every 213 minutes but he's always defied the stats um he doesn't need many chances he's very clinical um he would be the player I'd be tempted by to get because I don't want him long term so it should just be for one week and I A lot of people are holding transfers this Obsession you can get five transfers you can hoard them but for example if I I went into this game we with two transfers game four if if i' have had three transfers I definitely would have moved Gabrielle to to Robertson yeah as so many people did um and so that would have cost me 13 points um straight off the bat so having more transfers not necessarily a good thing so I'm happy just to use them on trying to get the best team each week um yeah and uh I think vardy would be a good punt next up in the list is Pedro I think we can we can whisk through a lot of these ones because these are the sort of players that injury doubts or or we might want to remove so Pedro is next on the list 5.7 million minutes for expected goalen bman every 240 minutes as I said he's sort of third behind Welbeck and well matoma and welck um there but I put him in there just so we can sort of Benchmark him munes is next he's not very I mean and gimenez is there so munes has got is generating more goal expected goal involvement than gimenez but it's a very small sample with Jimenez he's been subed or it did get a start the weekend at munz expense what do we think I mean I I I guess we'll know from the uh League Cup this week whoever's starting that probably is not going to start on Saturday yeah I did have a look on a full and Forum earlier today just to see what the feeling was in terms of that Center forward spot and a lot of them were saying they they prefer Mones in that role but he is on a he is it feels like he needs a goal yeah you know he's he's on a long run without scoring and um just for his kind of confidence levels I think he does need to to hit the back of the net doesn't really help us I mean is heenez going to start at the weekend and then start in midweek I think it's probably unlikely and then we we're going to be faced with that kind of decision at the weekend it's not a great fixture anyway at home against Newcastle it's okay at least it's at home but it's not it's not great no I think isack is going to be key isn't he because I think if he's if he's out then then I might need to move from one of these forwards on this list because I I don't I don't trust don't trust really mon will get that start um lon's next you mentioned him before so he sort of wrapped up the same with kuna as him keep an eye on him for game week nine or so um edan's next at Leicester formerly of Crystal Palace he's intriguing me um because he has been okay whenever he got minutes for Palace but um just a one start so far um Andes but shot and tar every 115 minutes um tempted by him I mean he's against ever I mean Everton will con see three goals if they go two and N up yeah I don't think so I want to see how he fits into that team at leester and where he slots in I don't see vardy being dropped just for now because he's obviously one of their key men do they do they eventually put Edward in behind him potentially but I think for now I wouldn't be looking at Edward now no um at West Ham I mean the Talisman at West Ham it's in fact such yeah uh expected goal involvement uh 1.75 um Antonio's in this list at 5.5 I thought I'd made a mistake and I still might have done but when I was looking at the table minutes per shot on target zero so he hasn't had a shot on target yeah um and he started all four games Bowen came on um and sorry Bowen was already on but he um but when Antonio was taken off B and moved more Central and I suspect judging by these stats we might see that more often yeah and came on and made an impact didn't he so I just think yeah and F krug's injured but he's going to be coming back in so don't think he can pick Antonio at the moment to be the central striker of any team in the Premier League and have zero shots on Target in four matches it's very poor um so if we're looking at that the manager is looking at that Jimenez we've already mentioned at Fulham only just that one start but M put shot on target every 39 minutes very strong um D Everton he's playing out on the wing um I I I'd go in a sort of sliding scale sort of mcneel calv Luen maybe and die I'm just not that yeah good play good play good player but and he probably helps those players that you just mentioned because if if you've got a a strike force with McNeil in the Middle where he's been playing and D on the left Calbert Le up front Harrison on the right that gives me a little bit of confidence that Everton can kind of start turning it around a little bit but as an FPL option no probably third in line maybe fourth in line at Everton um and just to round off to say we've got deapa IP switch who might temp people but his stats are awful minutes but expected goal bement every 674 minutes um despite four starts uh when I was looking at Talisman for attacking teams iwi are the worst team in terms of attack expected goals one and a half in four games bearing in mind Liverpool is eight for example um they do have Southampton next but their Talisman is in fact Leaf Davis so if I was going to go it would be Leaf Davis and I did notice I saw him in the Scout picks as well for Fantasy Football Scout um understandably so no dap so yeah dap we I mean having said that he could get a hatch but um well not keen yeah he scored a couple of weeks ago he hit the post at the weekend the only problem for dap is that Hurst is back for them and he's gonna he's going to start eating into his minutes I don't know if he'll start ahead of him but he came off on 60 at the weekend so no I mean I I didn't mind him last week but you know as as we go on and then you look at the fixtures of people like Everton yeah and Lester and things like that that if you're looking for a a stri to last your six game weeks or something like that I still don't think you go I switch despite okay fixtures it's just that Hearst threat no um I think so I thought overall for me don't know if this the same for you I think it's that Everton Leicester game is the budget Striker game yeah and calv Leen is the one to get if you're looking long term and V's your onewe punt yeah yeah I think that that that's it and and if you wanted to do something about bit different maybe Ona because I don't think that home game against United in the 5:30 starting Saturday is a bad one for Palace I think they'll score one or two so um but yeah I'd agree with that definitely um okay let's have a look at your game week five team uh I've got a picture of Alexander Arnold day he's in your team so hopefully for a better score this week um do you want to run through your team and and any uh potential transfer plans yes I've got Henderson unfortunately in goal at home against man united but not worth a transfer there so we'll stick with them until we wild card um I've got Alexander Arnold at home against Bournemouth coner at home against wolves and porro at home against brenford at the back um Salah Captain home against Bournemouth um a key reason why we bought him in last week for Captain C this week got Minter at home against Forest e at home against United Smith thrower at home against Newcastle and Rogers at home against wolves got harand home against Arsenal and Isa um away at Fulham up front and then I've got Bentley monit Robinson and quanz are on the bench um got one one3 transfer .3 million in the bank um so um so that probably two scenarios here around isak so let's say isak is fit uh what what are you going to do if he's fit I'll probably do nothing um I'm still unsure about the wild card we we mentioned it a bit earlier on but I'm looking at my team and I haven't got Arsenal and I haven't got brenford now that's the two key reasons to to Wild Card in six I think but if I could save a transfer this week I could probably get omomo and sacka or I could get sacka and Gabrielle and wait a week on brenford and I think quite a few of these players would maybe stick in the wild card and that's why I'm hesitating a little bit you know players like conza and porro and harand they're players which you want to keep so I just need to weigh that up a little bit but um the the only issue the potential problem is if esack is out and then I need to think carefully about what I'll do um obviously if munit is benched in in midweek and then it looks like he's going to come into the team at the weekend then that's fine I would probably play him but if there's doubts around those two players then I might have to start looking at somebody like um Cal Leen or like that yeah I guess if you're not going to Wild hard in six caloon is the one there um excellent well um we'll see you again next week uh find out how you did in game week five and also to look at your game week six plans whether you're going to wild card or not um uh good luck with the game week um thanks so much everyone for watching and listening uh do remember to press that like button and do remember to subscribe as well keep up toate your latest videos and podcasts um Tom good luck see you next week thanks Jo see you soon,6088,hello and welcome to another video and podcast from fancy football scout my name is joe and today im joined by fantasy football scout deputy editor tom freeman and friend to have a look at his game week five team welcome tom how are you im good thanks jo weve got an addition here this is peggy say hello everybody so she came and sat on my lap at the precise time were about to start recording so im hoping shes im going to put her down now the whole show hes gonna hopefully just go into the corner and remain nice and quiet so good girl peggy and well see how we get on but im good thanks joe poor game week four like a lot of people i think but villa and champions league action a bit later on so i cant be too cant be too down beat so rolling back the years its going to feel like 1982 again i have got the right year havt i it is 1982 it was the year i was born so i cant forget that one so i imagine there were a lot of babies born in the burmingham area that year okay so what were going to do today were going to have a look at toms gw four team as he said it didnt go so well so well wont linger on that too long were gonna have a special focus on budget strikers because lots are interested in them people are while game ex six can take a punt in game week five and theres also lots of options as well lots of players losing their places injuries etc and of course well look at toms gw five plans as well just a reminder do do check out the members are at fantasy football scout any stats we show here season ticket etc theyre all on there so you can do have a look at the members area at fantasy football scout you can make your own tables all those kinds of things also please do subscribe and like the sub subscribing is good because you can keep updated with our latest videos and podcasts as well okay lets have a look lets get straight into game week four ive got a picture of a confused looking aay next to your team so youve got 41 points and its a bit of a red arrow down to three million so do you want to just quickly run through your team who your who your star is talk about some of the others its harland and 10 others isnt it but so from back to front weve had henderson in goal im not going to say how many points they got because everybody was one or two but we had henderson in goal alexander arnold conza and robinson at the back salah mina e and rogers in midfield and then monitz har and captain and isack up front on the bench bentley smith row who did return but did didnt come into my team like he did for quite a few others due to j pedro but hes rooted to the bench in my setup and then porro and quanza as well okay so youre are you are you heading for a gw six wild card is that your plan or are you thinking at afterwards or well thats always been the plan but when we bring up my team and have a look in a bit for next week and im not totally convinced if its if its going to be worth it because i think i can get to quite a similar team which id want a wild card to with maybe a minus four maybe even without a hit so im still i may well press the button im just im 5050 at the moment but the team looked good on paper last week i think we sat here and did our video joe and lots of home fixtures lots of positivity i said you were you were one or two steps ahead of me i definitely wasnt so but the players just didnt turn up just blank blanks abs ely everywhere robinson lost that clean sheet so late on and then ive got ive got 20m invested in liverpool players and they got three points between them i took sacka out for salah like a lot of people did so im five points down with that started monit over smith row he was bench it was just one of those weeks where pretty much everything went wrong apart from harland who who at least it was bad but at least i got the captaincy right and at least i could get 26 points via him definitely i see what you mean about your team as well because youre not that invested in say brighton for example who fixures turning game week six you can get a couple of arsenal players as you said with a two freeze or a hit in game week six you youve already got two aston villa theyve got good fixtures continuing through game six and of course you get to keep harland you dont have to get harland and youve got pedro porro who is very handy from game week five well i dont have porro sorry i do have porro i dont have sorry what i was gonna say i dont dont no i was further ahead of you i was already thinking about my moves for that but i could potent but i could potentially bring in onomo and say either sack or an arsenal defender with free transfers so i dont have b move feels key in game week six but i could bring them in free transfers so do i need to wild card im not quite so sure yet okay okay so big decisions well come to that game five in a sec okay what were going to look at now is some budget strikers the reason were doing that youve got munis in your side i have as well im going to bench him next week because hes being benched at the moment but weve also got some other issues well weve got some emerging budget strikers as well calv les doing well vards rolling back the years getting returns so theres theres options there as well theres some teams with new strikers as well nikas emerged as well as a potential option meanwhile potential injury to pedro isak as well potential injury its theres a lot up in the air i think like me youre probably going to hold your transfer until the end of the week because were can have more information then that esack eye injury feels key doesnt it if he were to miss it and like i think like youve got as well joe you said youve got monit as well suddenly if isacks are doubt monit might not start weve got a bit of a problem so thats why were looking at this list just in case we need to react on friday and wher who was a big target is injured for two months ive got pedro and munise mun on the bench for me but and but i want to play pedro but if we get the nod that hes like a serious doubt by the end of the week then i will move to put pedro perhaps just have a very a better first sub than moon is at the moment okay lets have a look at some budget strikers okay so what ive done is ive gone to the members area fantasy football scout i have sorted this by minutes per expected goal involvement ive also included some stats like fouls one and shots on target because they are useful in terms of bonus points so you can see why a lot of strikers are getting bonus points if they get a return this season ive also got the fixtures on the side for gw five which show that ipswitch have a favorable fixture against sampton as do sampton against ipswitch everton against leicester is good for both of those sides as well brightons good little mini fixture run good fixture run continues with ning and forest aston villa home to wolves is good but so could be an option there chelsea way to west ham liverpool of course home to b bournemouth but in terms of good fixtures there its quite a good week for budget strikers everton ipswich sampton bon leicester theyve all caught good fixtures lets start with the top in terms of minutes per expected goal involvement every 98 minutes so pretty much a goal and moment the game expected to get but he missed a penalty yes vansson at bournemouth salanki replacement hes only 59 hes won six fouls been foul six times minut per shots on target every 67 minutes and started three times im not quite bournemouths way to liverpool is not the its not the week to get him in but in future are you looking at him i think he could work but i think it depends when you wild card theyve got two good fixtures after next week against the newly promoted clubs and then it turns bad again so if you were going to say wild card in eight that a move for evan nelsson this week might make sense i quite like him and i think he is i think i think its just a matter of time before he scores because theres a lot that hes doing right in that team but maybe for somebody whos gonna well wild card in may maybe seven then theres a bit more doubt around him and you might get two better fixtures from a few names further down the list currently seeno is the talisman in terms of expected goal involvement at bournemouth so thats one to monitor i think he would get the nod for me on a wild card in game week six but ian elson and the next place wier i put him ive kept him in even though hes injured just so people can benchmark the alternatives against him but theyre pretty much on their own in terms of minutes per exp expected goal and bowlman hes every 105 minutes and theres a big gap between him and the third place which is kuna who will come to in a sec but ev nson his stats are strong as good as vs so i am im very tempted by him but thisa big miss big miss minutes per shot on target every 71 minutes he had won fouls 11 fouls he won hes just hes just dripping in bonus points and goals and for close range efforts its a sh its a shame i think shs probably going to come in for him whos that hes the midfielder could be good but that isnt going to help you if youve got wizer and you need to make a change to a forward definitely now kuna is in interests me a lot he is next placed on here minutes per expected goal involvement every 142 minutes shots on target as strong so but theyre not get generating the expected stats but minutes per shot on target every 56 minutes hes won8 fouls hes 65 so hes a little bit more expensive but 65 still cheap trouble is hes way to aston villa this week and the fixtures dont turn i think its until gw nine but for those who think far ahead or ive definitely got kuna in mind for gw nine but hes just not yet im the same i like stran larson as well from wolves whos been million cheaper but has had a couple of attacking returns so far and i thought they were a bit unlucky against newcastle at the weekend i think that game could have gone either way and k is a good option but gw n perhaps even they go to brighton i think in game week nine dont they so it might even be game week 10 dependent on how brighton looked them but i think villa liverpool brenford city its a tough run isnt it and wolves arent playing theyre not getting good results at the moment theyre in a bit of a slump under gary oneal so i think that is probably a wait and see i think definitely perhaps nor wait andy though he fourth place on its ntia so hes emerged from arsenal a former hattrick hero at arsenal so we know hes got the quality and weve seen the quality from arsenal players going to other teams look at smith r at fulham so nika crystal palace is 59 one just one a couple of f just one that one start but his expected goal involvement is 57 minutes so promising there and the fixture is okay against man utd but its at home is cuz hes former arsenal its i just i just feel that he i could be i could be very tempted matas more but if i had the if i couldnt afford mateta who is on sharing penalty duties with e nti i think hes worth a go i think so too joe i think he had six shots in his debut on saturday which is twice as many as vard hes had across the whole season so thats quite encouraging i think he t had some like 15 penalty box touches which are the most in the game week among forwards as well his positioning is quite interesting because glasner is playing this 3421 and hes taken up that alis position from last year where hes a little bit withdrawn on the right so hes not like the focal point like mateta but hes 59m so you youve got to take that into account and i think he could do pretty well i think id probably i would take him above vardy i might probably put cvin le and who were going to come on to him minute slightly ahead because hes got penalties and keo wont have but its i think hes one of the better options on this list for sure definitely and next one next one is welbeck now i think welbecks one to consider if you are wild card in six and you just want to take a punt on he i hes a very reliable starter at the moment i cant see him not starting is pedro we dont know about at the moment we assume it seems to be precautionary but we dont know whether that precautionary is going to extend into the next game week which would be annoying because game week four and five exactly when we want a brighton player but well be at 57 minutes per shot on target every 83 minutes per expected goal involement 87 minutes so hes fourth no four 1 two three four sorry hes fifth in this in this table terms of budget options i think long longer term joe what is his minutes going to decline do you think or do you is hard to say or its hard to say at the moment because arguably hes looked in better shape than he was when he was at like man utd and and bigger teams so hes arguably a better player now and i think i was i dont know if it was on this show or was it fbi generals last week where i was saying i saw i saw the briyan game i saw last season before last against liverpool and he did a pesque goal and people like laughing in the chat and i was saying well you have a look have a look have a look for yourself just key in to youtube wellbe wonder goal liverpool and youll see it and i think hes i think hes a great option the problem is there fixes stiffen from gw six so hes a real onewe plan if you havent already got him but if youre sitting with well beck in your team then take heart keep take heart from this next option is chris woods who i was going to get rista on my wild cards ive kept that budget and i think i might get chris wood ive always liked chris wood and so because hes just reliable even if hes coming off the bench or hes only getting 60 minutes he doesnt need many shots hes so experienced minutes per shot on target every 44 minutes which is great minutes per expected goal involvement every 188 minutes which places him just below welbeck and above cal lean here i like chriswood nan forest they put liverpool to the sword so i think i think hes just hes hes hes the boring pick but hes probably the best that it does seem to be that way a bit hes not being spoken about that much but if you look at his record under nuno he deserves to be because hes been consistently good under him scoring a lot of goals and the fixtures for forest are okay theyve got brighton but then they got fulham at home they got alice at home who havent looked particularly tight this season and then after that what have you got you got leicester so i think that probably is an argument there was a bit of talk earlier in the season about how on eh he and how he would impact his minutes but that hasnt come to fruition too much yet and wood feels like first choice there so they look good forest under nuno this year dont they so again put him in put him on the watch list definitely another reason i like him i did some a table for f general show so do have a look at that or listen to that if youre listening to the podcast version in which we look to the most attacking teams but crucially who theyre most who their talisman is who is gobbling up the expected goal involvement and interest ly for a lot of these teams its not the budget strike or its not the striker that were looking for so bournemouth its looking down the list here if i can seo is seeno im just trying to seeno hes just taking so many shots seeno not i nson wo it is kuna thats why im very interesting him but crystal palace is not aeter yet and at brighton its not welbeck and its not pedro its matoma is the guy most likely but at ninghan forest it is chriswood so thats what appeals to him if i think n forest is going to score its more than likely to be him absolutely for the next l calvin leen very intriguing because i think weve often said if fit hes a good option and he does appear to be injuryf free but he is also not the talisman for everton are the third worst team in terms of attacking teams so far this season and its mcneel with expected goal involvement of 163 but so its not cal nevertheless minutes per expected goal involvement every 196 minutes minutes per shot on target every 160 minutes so theyre not great stats but nevertheless he is an experienced clinical striker who is injury free i think a lot of people will be interested in him i think because theyre playing leicester and i think mcneel creates a lot but i think in terms of whos going to score the goals if everton are going to turn a bit of a corner theyve scored four in the past two weeks i know theyve lost both games but theyve scored a few i think it is probably going to be him i get why people will be skeptical because he was massively under underachieved last year terms of his xg i think his xg delta was higher than darwin nunes but he finished strongly i think he scored four in his last seven last year and hes taken that form into this season three attacking returns in four game weeks hes got penalties and i think the appeal is those fixtures isnt it joe hes got he take he go hes got all three of the newly promoted clubs in the next six game weeks all way but he is playing them and then youve got some okayish fixtures at goodison park and so i would probably i would probably take him over any of the other forwards on this list given those fixtures i think i think especially if youre not wild carding in gw six hes a great option because as you said he his next hes top of the fixture ticker everton are right up until gw 11 with all of those great fixtures you mentioned so thats thats why tempted someone like me whos walky in six if i was going to take a punt i can possibly gowhere but i think he is a good hes a good option this week good option coming up sor he sorry i was say he was a handful against villa on saturday he should have put that game to bed when it was two one i think and then he missed he hit the bar as well so hes getting chances and hes up against good defenders like kza and so hes i i dont mind that i wonder with everton with branway back if well if he is back this weekend which he does look like could be then i they cant for a team to lose to be two nil up and then lose 32 for the second game we a row thats thats poor thats poor theyre just i watched the game with a couple of everton fans and even at 20 up theyre not confident at all and they were all saying this will this will finish 32 and it happened and it and they need brwi next to tarkowski theyve got problems at fullback but i think it will improve for everton but they need to start getting some key players in vards next in the list hes only 57 i think hes just gone up but hes not the vardy of 2016 but is he now 37 i think so but m every 107 minutes expected goal involvement every 213 minutes but hes always defied the stats he doesnt need many chances hes very clinical he would be the player id be tempted by to get because i dont want him long term so it should just be for one week and i a lot of people are holding transfers this obsession you can get five transfers you can hoard them but for example if i went into this game we with two transfers game four if i have had three transfers i definitely would have moved gabrielle to robertson as so many people did and so that would have cost me 13 points straight off the bat so having more transfers not necessarily a good thing so im happy just to use them on trying to get the best team each week and i think vardy would be a good punt next up in the list is pedro i think we can we can whisk through a lot of these ones because these are the players that injury doubts or we might want to remove so pedro is next on the list 57m minutes for expected goalen bman every 240 minutes as i said hes third behind welbeck and well matoma and welck there but i put him in there just so we can benchmark him munes is next hes not very and gimenez is there so munes has got is generating more goal expected goal involvement than gimenez but its a very small sample with jimenez hes been subed or it did get a start the weekend at munz expense what do we think i well know from the league cup this week whoevers starting that probably is not going to start on saturday i did have a look on a full and forum earlier today just to see what the feeling was in terms of that center forward spot and a lot of them were saying they prefer mones in that role but he is on a he is it feels like he needs a goal hes hes on a long run without scoring and just for his confidence levels i think he does need to hit the back of the net doesnt help us is heenez going to start at the weekend and then start in midweek i think its probably unlikely and then were going to be faced with that decision at the weekend its not a great fixture anyway at home against newcastle its okay at least its at home but its not its not great no i think isack is going to be key isnt he because i think if hes if hes out then i might need to move from one of these forwards on this list because i dont i dont trust dont trust mon will get that start lons next you mentioned him before so he wrapped up the same with kuna as him keep an eye on him for game week nine or so edans next at leicester formerly of crystal palace hes intriguing me because he has been okay whenever he got minutes for palace but just a one start so far andes but shot and tar every 115 minutes tempted by him hes against ever everton will con see three goals if they go two and n up i dont think so i want to see how he fits into that team at leester and where he slots in i dont see vardy being dropped just for now because hes one of their key men do they do they eventually put edward in behind him potentially but i think for now i wouldnt be looking at edward now no at west ham the talisman at west ham its in fact such expected goal involvement 175 antonios in this list at 55 i thought id made a mistake and i still might have done but when i was looking at the table minutes per shot on target zero so he hasnt had a shot on target and he started all four games bowen came on and sorry bowen was already on but he but when antonio was taken off b and moved more central and i suspect judging by these stats we might see that more often and came on and made an impact didnt he so i just think and f krugs injured but hes going to be coming back in so dont think he can pick antonio at the moment to be the central striker of any team in the premier league and have zero shots on target in four matches its very poor so if were looking at that the manager is looking at that jimenez weve already mentioned at fulham only just that one start but m put shot on target every 39 minutes very strong d everton hes playing out on the wing id go in a sliding scale mcneel calv luen maybe and die im just not that good play good play good player but and he probably helps those players that you just mentioned because if youve got a strike force with mcneil in the middle where hes been playing and d on the left calbert le up front harrison on the right that gives me a little bit of confidence that everton can start turning it around a little bit but as an fpl option no probably third in line maybe fourth in line at everton and just to round off to say weve got deapa ip switch who might temp people but his stats are awful minutes but expected goal bement every 674 minutes despite four starts when i was looking at talisman for attacking teams iwi are the worst team in terms of attack expected goals one and a half in four games bearing in mind liverpool is eight for example they do have southampton next but their talisman is in fact leaf davis so if i was going to go it would be leaf davis and i did notice i saw him in the scout picks as well for fantasy football scout understandably so no dap so dap we having said that he could get a hatch but well not keen he scored a couple of weeks ago he hit the post at the weekend the only problem for dap is that hurst is back for them and hes gonna hes going to start eating into his minutes i dont know if hell start ahead of him but he came off on 60 at the weekend so no i didnt mind him last week as we go on and then you look at the fixtures of people like everton and lester and things like that if youre looking for a stri to last your six game weeks like that i still dont think you go i switch despite okay fixtures its just that hearst threat no i think so i thought overall for me dont know if this the same for you i think its that everton leicester game is the budget striker game and calv leen is the one to get if youre looking long term and vs your onewe punt i think thats it and if you wanted to do something about bit different maybe ona because i dont think that home game against united in the 530 starting saturday is a bad one for palace i think theyll score one or two so but id agree with that definitely okay lets have a look at your game week five team ive got a picture of alexander arnold day hes in your team so hopefully for a better score this week do you want to run through your team and any potential transfer plans yes ive got henderson unfortunately in goal at home against man united but not worth a transfer there so well stick with them until we wild card ive got alexander arnold at home against bournemouth coner at home against wolves and porro at home against brenford at the back salah captain home against bournemouth a key reason why we bought him in last week for captain c this week got minter at home against forest e at home against united smith thrower at home against newcastle and rogers at home against wolves got harand home against arsenal and isa away at fulham up front and then ive got bentley monit robinson and quanz are on the bench got one one3 transfer 3m in the bank so so that probably two scenarios here around isak so lets say isak is fit what are you going to do if hes fit ill probably do nothing im still unsure about the wild card we mentioned it a bit earlier on but im looking at my team and i havent got arsenal and i havent got brenford now thats the two key reasons to wild card in six i think but if i could save a transfer this week i could probably get omomo and sacka or i could get sacka and gabrielle and wait a week on brenford and i think quite a few of these players would maybe stick in the wild card and thats why im hesitating a little bit players like conza and porro and harand theyre players which you want to keep so i just need to weigh that up a little bit but the only issue the potential problem is if esack is out and then i need to think carefully about what ill do if munit is benched in midweek and then it looks like hes going to come into the team at the weekend then thats fine i would probably play him but if theres doubts around those two players then i might have to start looking at somebody like cal leen or like that if youre not going to wild hard in six caloon is the one there

12,AboveAverageFPL,7G7_tv1jLX0,FPL GW5 Team Selection | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-09-19T20:31:08Z,"[Music] la [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always joined by Baker evening mate how are you very well mate very well very well uh Saturday deadline first Thursday night yeah it's all pretty straightforward until game week 9 so we're pretty pretty chilled at the moment uh looking to bounce back is is kind of where I am at the moment looking to bounce back it's been a busy week and I haven't been able to think about FPL so I'm kind of cool I'm kind of happy that I'm in a position where you know I'm comfortable with rolling my transfer haven't had any dramas over the um over the no dramas yet no dramas yet well yeah yet I don't have any Arsenal players so that's kind of cool there still there's still pressers there still Saturday Le City Plus they're play on each other and yeah the only issue I have a guess is J Pedro at the moment but we can talk about that we can talk about that that's fine you know but um yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm looking good I think but I thought that last week how did you feel about Spurs last night no why M you didn't say you were gonna ask about Tottenham yesterday to be honest I I watched it because we were doing um we were doing something with the patrons last night I won't mention it because of all the stuff going on but um I was doing stuff with the patrons last night so I had it on in the background and I was just bored like the whole thing was just boring just rubbish and then it was if you have seen if anyone seen those uh those memes that are going around which is like this is the what is it like I'm really excited to see my team play I want to kill myself oh nice we won like that's kind of the timeline of every every tot fan and my boss at work is a centry fan so he he sent me a message he was like don't do not mention the game last night I said to be honest I'd wiped it from my memory I was not even going to mention it yeah there no it's a problem I tell you you know if we hadn't turned that around going into that this weekend and then we lost this weekend then it would have got real nasty you know is is you can only have so many games of 70% possession it's like I say it actually accelerate everything because it's quite boring when you've got 70% possession but still actually look like a team that's going to concede it's it's weird uh I think it's weird that we managed to re we we managed to recycle the ball in the most boring way and we have done it for I think I feel like we've done it for 15 years mate yes like and it doesn't matter who we have in terms of personnel or management it doesn't matter it's just exactly the same thing we've seen it so many times yeah but look if you if you have that amount of possession every game then The Bookies will probably like you as we're about to see they they do kind of like us this weekend um and at some point especially if there was an early goal it can click you know we saw that in the Everton game um orbe it uh brenford is probably a pretty Stern test other than that is everyone getting injured can I claim that I predicted everyone's going to get injured yeah yeah of course yeah you can unfortunately they're all mine yeah what did you say like just hamstrings just go or something hamstrings just go they just go they vanish they just vanish yeah it's happened to a lot it's happened to a lot of your players I'm seeing a lot of people Luke missing sending messages out or tweets out saying pray for me wow I saw I saw I saw he when I saw Luke's team earlier um and yeah if you feel him bad go look at Luke's team because he he makes my team it's the only person I've seen where I'm like oh that's more issues than I've got so far let's let's see how the week let's see the week plays out um but what would you make of the eack stuff what did you say it was like a toe injury or something or just not training I I don't know it's a bit weird I mean we love conspiracies and uh we'll probably get sued at some point one day but my only thing right if I'm being skeptical it he got he got in the nose yeah MH there's if you were thinking oh why did it go off at half time the word concussion might come out of your mouth um but the game was a half four game on a Sunday and the game on Saturdays a 3:00 game was less than six less than six days um so it's like concussion would be kashion would be gone for the following week as well yeah it would be but then it's like oh is it my eye and now is it my toe and I'm like is Eddie just making stuff up here to to try and get away from the fact that he probably was concussed um it's it's all very odd and even that toe injury which you've seen it's probably worth noting Craig hopu who wrote the article I think in the daily mail today um Craig H Hope's normally pretty good as a journal for Newcastle but he was doing it from a paid subscription version of The Daily Mail that and the only way that someone's getting going to sign up or do that payroll to have a look at it is hey guess what if we're a little sensationalist yeah um because I did see what was in that article I didn't pay the daily mail but I did see what was in that article and the end of it says but Newcastle I hope for he will lead the line on Saturday yeah yeah yeah I don't know it's it's a Taffy it is and we thing is we'll get nothing get nothing from from how tomorrow either no did you Al did you also see C did the um Photoshop of him with a ey patch on I did not our friend C did a I now have to look at this brilliant photo shop of him with with it on despite the fact he's in the old Castor kit so it's an old kit right it's it's not recent and he he sent me it beforeand like should I tweet this like yeah and then loads of people believed it loads of people have believed that he's wearing his iPad so good and there's some amazing ones in there alexanda is in is in like the pirate ISAC I saw uh it was turfy topper said Alex it should just be called Alexander sack now because he's got no [Laughter] eye wa it's that's it's it's the facial expression it's the teeth it's everything it's just perfection isn't it so course a good man a good good man but yes he hasn't got an ey patch just in case anyone does wonder that one brilant um yeah 121,000 views on that incredible brilliant it's never going to stop love it um J Pedro uh so he wasn't in the squad he wasn't sorry wasn't he wasn't in the squad car was he no hler said he was training but he just needed a few days yeah I mean I I enjoy that again the narrative also is that him not being in the oh he w't be in the squad pretty much every player that could be in the squad of every Squad this week was in the squad they just sit on the bench they still go they just sit on the bench that's that's it so you know if he if he could play he still would have sat on the bench like he would have like but he he wasn't ready to play that's that's the obvious bit of it what we don't know is a couple more days does that make him ready to play and then it's a question as well the next of obviously Geo was cup tight so he couldn't play at all so his direct replacement is as fresh as a daisy and he's not like it I don't know I don't know I don't know on that like you for example you probably have a very good first sub potentially um on it um but for you I don't think it's something where you should be looking at doing something with it no but for those that are riant on them and have a transfer in hand and don't have any issues and potentially a wild card or something I think I consider it I think I would consider making a move um I mean on it but I mean his last minutes were what two weeks ago or a week ago a week it was about a week ago wasn't it from today like the 11th did that is that when Brazil played because he played like 15 minutes or something like that so he hasn't played in a week and they're not playing until Sunday I think I mean yes I'm sitting here as you say with him and with decent enough bench he's likely to be an a n or Star isn't he I don't I don't suspect it's a cameo type space but um I think we're too early to be saying he could be rested for forest and then just so they have him for I don't know if it's question rested it's a question of weather you know what I mean you know what I mean not rested I mean like given the additional time to recover from injury yeah yeah but if he's not ready to start you know if he is only got 20 30 minutes on him then like we don't know CU we didn't know we didn't know why he wasn't playing in the first place it was a complete shock that sudden like oh he's not playing um so you don't it might be worth looking back at presses from from hler already because he's one of those that we don't know very much about yet still so maybe we should have a look back and maybe one of the Scout guys can have a look back and see how he might get he might get particularly lucky they just say yeah yeah and he's really important he's going to start yeah exactly exactly that but if he doesn't as I said you know I've seen a lot of people that are well carding in in game week six and they have him and they're like oh I want to roll this week so that I've got it I don't I don't know I don't know when when obviously vardy and DCL are just sitting there with a good game against each other pick your poison which one you want and K is playing almost certainly playing this week against man united yeah scored in midweek as well so he's that that monkeys off his back he can he can get on with scoring goals in the league now no problem um and you know for people with money in the bank obviously San's got a really good game all those type of stuff like I think if I had no no issues and I was sitting on him and I didn't get any positive news I would be tempted okay not for you cuz oh no no no would you it's not just me and you talking here is it well or be it consider everyone else if you looked if you looked past this week you know I guess the question is is is is Cal Leen or um with some really really good fixtures or vard Everton's fixtures are fantastic yeah In fairness but they're in and out lesters aren't there there's some games where it's like I definitely wouldn't and there's some games definitely definitely would but kind of get it kind of get it in terms of in terms of chasing um if someone wanted to wanted to move off this week this is the week to do it I mean you could just go chriswood you could just go you could just go back just go go back to Chris Wood and we talked about those first three fixtures being so good Brighton this week which is probably fine it's okay it's tough but it's you know it's probably the toughest game they'll have in the next five yeah Chelsea aside maybe Fulham and Palace and Leicester yeah so it's good fixtures there yeah should we pull the fix up we can pull the fixes up after we say hello to everyone in the chat so hello to hello to you guys hope you're having a nice Thursday Thursday evening um 140 of you now in if you want

just deliver it worldwide whatever we blackmail is what you're saying is we black people prizes yes we will bribe you for votes that's how it work if we get there so uh let's move on to fixtures and again for anyone that's new joining us we look at the graphics here from Rob T these are the mar this is the market data that comes from spreadex that tells us how many goals are expected to be scored by a team and the percentage chance of a clean sheet um being expected goals it's in a decimal format so please don't expect Liverpool to score 2.7 goals on Saturday um yeah and and then it's done as a mat on a matchup basis so you can see uh you can see basically how how the markets predict the match going yeah and for us like every week we'll concentrate on the teams that are predicted to score over two goals and this week we have Liverpool comfortably at 2.7 Tottenham at 2.3 and Villa at 2.1 and then when you're looking at the defense I mean it wasn't the greatest week for defensive predictions last week we could saw goals and it kind of played out that way you know is is only really Arsenal Defenders got anyone any defensive points um not many to shout about for for many others unless you had the maybe or or or Brighton guy um this uh this week Liverpool at 40% chance of a clean um and then you start moving into Villa 34 Brighton 34 totam 31 City still 34% at home to Man City against Arsenal is that's really interesting because I I kind of assumed everyone with Rico Lewis would just bench Rico Lewis for example um but it' be very difficult I imagine to get any kind of indication of whether he starts or not but people with like vard what you doing with him week probably starting I guess is the question is is the thing if you got V you got a starting I think yeah we need to see we need to see whether Pep's going to play yeah with vardal certainly with v certainly going to be Rico it's going to be about whether whether we whether we're going to get a leakers whether he starts although say I mean saying that I mean I don't think viio this is not a week where V gets rested right um for sure like last week so it is it is basically Walker or Lewis and obviously Lewis plays Lewis played in um in the week against inter right yeah yeah You' have to assume that this is a walker game it just feels like everything about it feels like a walker game doesn't it I mean Arsenal still got up against Martinelli like R back rice is back but obviously ard's still out so yeah is it we is it going to be Martin ell or is it going to be trossard I mean that that's probably isn't it uh yeah I guess play hard in the middle wouldn't you if odard I imagine I can't depends you going they're going to play they're going to play two sixes again surely surely they play they going play three sixes so they play rice as like almost the eight and then party and youro because you got to play three in the middle yeah but then you can't play trossard because you play yeah you don't you don't you don't play trossard that's what I'm saying you either stink it up with three sixes or you play dard yeah okay so you just assume left rather than trossard left and sacka right and HS up top well you wouldn't play trossard with three sixes didn't you know the only reason you play 3 sixes is then to have some width wouldn't you um yeah alongside it yeah so um I just think Martinelli is almost guaranteed to play the left wing because because of the fact of um yeah maybe they start it with 3 sixes and then bring TR then youve got trossard option haven't you yeah you either bring him on Just for Martinelli in the 60th minute like they like to do all the time or you bring him on for georgino probably um yeah that's probably what they're going to do yeah I mean I'm like if you're obviously the question is really like is on captaincy more than anything is like Harland like how would you feel looking at Harland here versus like Salah in that's that's that's the big one right it's not it's not really a question is it it's not really it shouldn't be it shouldn't be like would I be surprised if harand braced no because you're not surprised if the person who plays for the best team one of the best teams in the world braak is in any game and he's the best striker in the world so you're never going to be surprised about it but you got to play the odds on this and and look at it and so SM it what what would you do if if what would you personally do you haven't got Harland but if you had a leak that said that Mo wasn't starting on Saturday uh where you go then probably I'd probably cap Trent like I'd probably kep I I wouldn't feel great about it but i' probably kept Tren I'm trying to think you're now asking me who's in my team basically and where's your V going to it Trent uh Trent maybe salanki yeah maybe salanki to be honest Palmer West Ham Palmer away at West Ham last week was a bit iffy wasn't it so I don't know I mean me is is with harand um yeah it's got to be salanki yeah I probably would list I'm probably still going to leave my advice on Harland but we assume that's you've got both if you've got both yeah no yeah if you've got both it's Capal Vice harand and move on but we'll get the info Saturday morning I think the the good thing for Liverpool is that um they've obviously got caravell next week against West Ham not an easy fixture um at all for them you know West Ham will be definitely you know it's for for most teams now it's the carabat was like the best sort of like the best but also quite a competitive way to get a trophy isn't it we've seen teams we didn't make we made a few quite a few changes but it's still a relatively good team we've seen teams like Palace this week go in with almost a full strength team um I expect West H to put out a really good team it's such a it's such a weird one that League cut because everyone talks about everyone talks about obviously the FA Cup being the one like being the one because because every single team in the country can access it and at the same at the same time you enter at the same time as all of the other Premier League teams so but you've got a pool of you've got a pool of teams at that point where you could pull out an Anan bur right or a f like leis or a folkton invictor or something like that it's hard to win the carabel that's why all the good teams Win It it's the League Cup it's played out by the best teams in the flipping country like it's not it's a complete ruse everyone field into the che the semi-final and stuff like that like doesn't that doesn't exist well it could exist but it doesn't exist but you would expect for Liverpool the sensible thing is they put the main team that have been playing out on Saturday they bring in the people like G Po and Darwin for the West Ham game and then you go back again on the league they got they got plenty though like you could you could build that you could build that team Bradley Simas I mean all those guys they're they're all there the question the question obviously we don't know with slot what he could do is he could mix a match couldn't he so he could make a couple of changes this week so that he plays a couple of his main guys in midweek and and we just don't know until you know like we have no idea this weekend we have no idea how those managers that managed in Europe will rotate their squads going into the weekend at at the same time City have won four in a row and Liverpool lost last weekend like I don't it's not a week where it's not a week where you can just let a team let a few players go no and just say the Rest boys if there's one player that you're worried about for Liverpool is the player that I've got Diego doter like he he is is a worry but he's probably also only ever 603 anyway yeah that's all you ever say so for me with jotter um I don't see that I will be taking jotter out even if we got a leak that he wasn't starting I'll probably just i' probably just let it happen um and hope that you know the the 30 minutes a goal could can do so much can't it you know what I mean like like goal scorers are now getting most of them are getting like one or two bonus just from getting a goal um so it he could still easy score an 8 n pointer he can also score a onep pointer that's just the way that's the way it goes but if I was to hit him to someone then that player's got to immediately get a return hav't they um that's that's quite tough yeah doesn't definitely definit doesn't feel like it's worth it like if you're cuz you're wild card in next week almost certainly yeah so I wouldn't be taking out players that play this week no I definitely will be playing I definitely will CS as soon as I get the chance def so you're not you're not taking any players out to play this week if you're going to make a punt at all you take out a player that's not going to play yeah they not going to play completely or it had has low upside so munis for example we don't know if he plays or not but you'd expect the fact that he played the carabal in midweek yeah that he wouldn't start this weekend that he wouldn't start this weekend you expect that and it's not a great week for him even if he did yeah even if he did start he's he's now what a 60 70 minute player on a 1.4 expected goals so he's a relatively easy enough move my only thing on JTA where I'd be like well maybe I could take a hit would be if I shifted down on him but enabled me to get salanki okay because 2.3 expected goals is a lot or it meant even as far as kind of get Watkins you know for some people there might have some money in the bank and it might might be enough to do it um yeah if I was to take a cheap mid punt this week well ask you the question before I tell you who I like um any cheap mid punts that would stand out for you that you like so I mean Mina potentially um I mean who do you have in your team you have Rogers already right I've got Rogers Ahad maybe I don't I think ahmad's not a bad shout and he ammad is how low I would have to go literally ammad gives me exact money to get to Watkins that's like as low as I could go um I don't think there's anyone cheaper than that that you that you that you'd want to go to if I was Guy a little bit more I am quite tempted with koseski at 6 .3 interesting I mean he has to he has to start after after yesterday he's our best player yeah he's our best play like literally he's the only only good goody there um you've got obviously you got Dwight MC say oh you just go Dwight McNeil yeah of course got Dwight mcil he's not enough he's not enough for me to get to get to um uh and all these players you're like right taking a hit on these rather than necessarily jot a 30 minutes it's a bit it's a bit icky well there's the reason they're price to where they are yeah but yeah if I wanted to fully lead in Spurs bias and just say right Tottenham it's on you how my weekend goes mate we do that every weekend anyway I could minus four J and munes to salagi and and koseski oh that's given me a headache already it's the most horrific thing I've ever thought of in my entire life oh man that is so that is so bad it is bad someone saying Hutchinson someone saying dibling I mean like let's not Southampton playing it I I don't I don't care I care so little about this game from from a pick perspective I I really don't they're both bad teams they're both bad underline numbers that said that said itwi have had the two toughest games but yeah we've got we've got quite number of games here where it's relatively tight looks like a 2-1 in one way or another and we're not really sure fham Newcastle looks like a 2-1 leester Villa looks like a 2-1 um even Villa walls potentially is a 2-1 you know maybe that that could be a 2-0 or or a 3-1 type space Southampton it Swit either way Alice man united either way even Man City Arsenal could be a 21 yeah um it it does look like the common 15 super six two On's all over the place look like look like the ways this weekend apart from Liverpool so you've got you've got to push with that I think and Salah just cap just feels obvious to me um and whoever you've got you got a plan um I do think I do think there's going to be some rotation I am I am worried about I'm worried about Josh obviously I'm worried about Rogers I think I think he played 90 minutes again whenever everybody else is coming off he played another 90 minutes he's playing 90 minutes all the time he's a young guy we've seen it so often a young guy just suddenly it be like oh I just played youran this week alongside him like we we shouldn't think it just doesn't happen every all I see on Twitter everyone being like is this the week he's going to return and I'm like I hope so I really hope so but also he just might not start um same on you know M you know you looked at you mentioned earlier but dingu just keeps scoring like he played 82 minutes m in in in the caribel now Dingle played 0 so that's that should mean that he's okay for it but those minutes are getting shakier for some of these guys if Rogers continues to not return and Jan does at some point they go why don't we just start Jan and then and then bring Rogers on I don't think I don't think think it's a problem with what he's creating though like everything looks good when he's on the pitch it that's that's a positive thing and the fact that you know chances aren't being converted isn't always his issue no no but he is he isn't scoring and he very often yeah yeah but well he's often there as the second receiver that's what we've talked about it repeatedly that he's often or it would get to him but it doesn't get to him cuz what just gets in the way of the ball type stuff like he is he is effectively a second Striker like he's not an out and out sit on the wing beat your man Winger that's not not what he is he is in and amongst it you could quite easily just play youran and and and Watkins any week like at some point it can happen Bailey's sort of back you know Ramsey can play out wide right it I mean it's it's got it does you're right it does have to happen that needs to get a start I don't think he's it's not almost not fair for him to to not is it to have you know done done what he's done in the minutes that he's had he must be just turning around like you know come on gaffa it's it's so much more it's so much more painful to us that Rogers wouldn't start then it would be to Rogers or his teammates like they they'd be absolutely fine with it yeah yeah fine I played 9 Minutes in midweek I'll just sit on the bench this week I'm still very much in the game it's everyone's really happy with me um I'm a kid but yeah other than that it's it's a tough I think there's very few players that I'd want to move heaven on Earth for this weekend I think up front Salan and Watkins are the clear boys that you've got to be trying to get in um if you had to pick one of DCL or vardy this week where' you be uh for one week one week for one week I would pick DCL I would pick DCL interesting I think Everton have been good I mean look the defensively they've had they've had been a nightmare they've scored four goals in the last two games it's not not really an issue from a goal scoring position point of view cavon is getting into positions which are good and he is missing chances but he is scoring chances as well yeah that that is the one thing in it vardy did score last week but it was his only shot of the game yeah I've I've I've gone back and forth on this because in my best case situation this week I simply move moon is to one of DCL or vardy that's my best case situation unless I would have a real big decision to make so if somehow he is is H said yeah I Pedro starting then that changes everything um but the idea that he would just come out and say that he definitely is starting is very very difficult yeah Let's uh let's move to let's move to our teams let's move to our teams because um I think we've covered pretty much everyone there yeah and as we do that Atlanta have missed a penalty perfect perfect that's just what we wanted to hear uh let's start with you mate uh yes here's the pain so yes if people haven't seen or heard or listened to the fact that I got pain this week I have the lovely Henderson in goal uh against his old club man united uh maybe he'll take that as a you know little extra incentive to do okay uh then I've got porro Anthony Robinson and Gabrielle um yeah my other Defenders other than Gabrielle are leis Hall uh who I just can't see him playing leis Hall up against Adama can you you play Lloyd Kelly against ad wouldn't you away from home I wouldn't be confident I wouldn't be confident playing Lloyd Kelly against ad Dharma would you be would you be more confident I'm playing Lis Hall against him it's probably as bad as each other probably it's probably as bad as each other to be honest it's not it's not exactly unless you're have they got any other fit center backs because you wouldn't you wouldn't even want to play Dan burn against him would you either way I'd still P I still gonna go Gabrielle over leis hall or or or Ben Johnson yeah yeah yeah no that's fine uh so it's bad no Trent already straight away no Robo um they were good last week mate they were good last week so yeah yeah Gordon and again like if isach is out the last thing I want is Gordon playing for 9 again that was just horrible um so I'd like to hope they play aula and then Gordon can be more of the main man around um it but uh yeah Gordon's potentially not good and Gordon obviously is up against Anthony Robinson who I'm playing um can't really win then I've got Rogers I've got J I've got Salah got munes I got isack I got Harland I guess you know for me looking at this is uh the reason I didn't start with Salah was I probably didn't have enough robust picks around it to run a Salo and Harland team um and that's what I'm exactly what I'm seeing here is is the second I've brought him in I'm like God everything else is really really really unstable that is the problem of running of running as teams is the edges look so painful like if if someone's on wild card now next week and you want to run the seller and Harland and continue to run it just look at the other players that are in my team today and have that in your mind like nailed nailed nailed is so important um when you've got those type of players uh yeah moon has got to go isack might have to go um it's it's a tough week mate it's a tough week yeah but you just have to hope don't you it worked I I had an appalling looking team last week and got away with it um realistically parand and and mo do lots of stuff you just need a couple of goals don't you yeah a parro banger um a Gordon a Gordon Hall and it'll be okay nothing it could be bad and if it is bad if I lose so well have look at this SEC so I'm expected to get 52 points I'm so GL I'm I tell you what I'm so glad I'm so glad that you you went to that expected points number just then because about two minutes ago I realized that Captain was on Harland and I've just literally changed the image because it was on 49 it was on 49 I was like that is mad because I know mine's like way above that but anyway a lot of this is probably because you've got you've got a lot of players playing against each other here you've got harand against Gabrielle you've got Gordon against and esack against Robinson you know that's not that's that's the kind of heding I hate mate I a got no choice mate well I know you don't but just say I got no choice that's that's that's why and but you can you you can never protect hedging for so long can you you can protect it for two or three weeks you can't protect it in week five you know what I mean is is is is by that time it's it's long long gone um so yeah there's a couple of questions in the chat before your about like wild card this week and what would you do if you were the wild card I think Dan said it was on Wild Card bosy mentioned it and all that stuff is is similar one of the things adding things I've said there is I don't like the mo and Harland drafts I still don't like it um and I don't feel like and and as soon as you come out of this week I'm so much heavier leaning Harland than Mo and therefore I I I can't see that I'd want to make that huge decision for when actually those two guys are so good that they can they can cover any week we've seen it um so yes do would I expect to get somewhere between 10 to 20 War points this week if I wild card yes because I would have a very similar team probably to what Adam's about to show um is but I also have only have one free transfer which I use this week so I'll still have one track transfer so I it's been such an unstable position if I wild carded I'm better to take I'm better to lose 20 points to the crowd this week than I am to Wild Card yeah because otherwise I'm just I'm patching patching and I'm still patching next week I'm still patching next week and I'm never getting to that position whereas there's there's lot between between 6 and 12 there's a lot of shift there some big shifts going around so I feel like I feel like you need and game week five is not one of those shifts right that's the thing and because it's not one of those if you use a chip like this in this particular week then it's going to be hard to maneuver the change in game week six for Arsenal then in game we seven for City and then coming out of Arsenal in game week n like yeah that's the tough that's diff that's the stuff that is difficult to do if you don't have either a chip or transfers yeah so you're going to even had two transfers in the bank I'd think about it I definitely would think about it I'd probably just still use those transfers if I'm honest but having one nah it's like you're just saying I'm going to be but I'm again I'm right up against it this week and I'm still going to be up against it going forward yeah I've got to try and I've got to try and get some validation as I said if I take a million rank drop this week then I take a million rank drop this week it's fine yeah you me so yeah so I'm you know just touch on the expected points there yeah I was looking mine's up at 60.3 so my my plan here is to is to roll um assuming that we get you know no further information that that makes this worse but I've got Martinez in goal um now home fixture against wolves yeah he's very likely to concede because that's what Martinez does but you know he's probably better than than he got a 34% chance which is better than all bar one keeper this weekend exactly uh double Liverpool defense Robertson Trent is the best two chances of play and then Pedro porro who also has over a 30% chance it's it's three hit teamers and then uh Midfield Bruno salak cap Rogers e and um and and Co Pala and then salanki and then jaia Pedro up front I say I've got entia on the bench you know no drama if I want to bring him in I got Leaf Davis on the bench no real drama if I want to bring him in Lewis I probably just wouldn't the only thing it's interesting is it it's tough it's tough because as we say I think if Arsenal stink it up right and it and they you know playing for this nil nil like Lewis is a really good pick Lewis is a really good pick this week because you're going to get the option you're going to get good chance of a clean sheet plus he he he finds Pockets right he's the kind of a player that wants to get into pockets and if he's doing little dances with Phil foden in the middle there as they as they're trying to get around the Arsenal defense he could be in and around that intricate passing that you know ends up in a Crea chance or ends up in a shot so I don't think he's as bad a pick as long as we get the information that he starts and then yeah and that and that's basically my team I don't I want to have four transfers going into next week I want to be able to shift over to a couple of Aral players minimum um I mean it would be ins I think even if they said Pedro's out until after the next International break I still don't think I'd make a transfer now more look you look at that you're like God I would bite your arm off for any of those three on your bench this week yeah but I but I've wild carded so it's fine I you know I've had I've had to make this plan because I've wild carded and so I'm it's such a strong like I mean this team by the way 23 points last week 23 yeah well that's that's like I say everybody's team was 23 points if they didn't have one or two players last week yeah everybody's team was that it's just so happens one of them a lot of people kept him um and yeah it's it's in a very robust position for the next next few weeks and I was trying to get my head round it earlier that the idea that you from next week so you'll have four transfers next week mhm so you could make I could make five transfers I could make five transfers for a minus four but but that's the in my opinion right that's the stupid stuff like where we need to change our brain is is I think everyone said oh if I've got free transfers you know I used to make that mini Wild Card well I can make a mini Wild Card well that's just showing your hand that's just going all in like I don't get it right what you could do is do two free transfers next week then pick up another one and then pick up another one and then you could do two free transfers the week after yeah you just do two and roll two and roll two do it for like you'll be able to do it for four weeks in a row yeah like that is such an unbelievable thing so let's say everyone's like be straight into their brain of like oh what I could do is like make four or five transfers and be that's not as strong as doing two transfers every week for three or four weeks and where you don't need to do them don't do them because the likelihood is every time you make two transfers you probably don't need to make a transfer the week after yeah like once you're there in that Holy Grail territory like I don't know I don't know that I'll ever make it there cuz I've never I've never made it there before so what what's to say that I'll never make it yeah exactly un this could just be where people that get to four Just Surf the wave to 38 and I think you know is is I think the the worst thing that people could do is use three or four in a week once a gone because if you use three four in a week and you had a week where you had two injuries or or suddenly just the game changed you're like ah oh okay the beauty is that we've got we know we we're planning we're planning moves to an extent but at the same time major things can Happ like if this was a week where you know I get three injuries for example I can I can navigate that and I can I can move I can move around that quite quite easily and I think as long as as long as like crazy weeks like this don't happen which I mean invariably they will because we're going to get more games coming up although you know listening to some of the people talk about how teams are going to navigate these Europa like Champions League like this is something really interesting that I heard so City let's say City you have to finish in the top eight right to avoid that playoff which is two games yeah but if you finish 17th or 16th or 17th you do qualify but you have to play two extra games so what does it requ require to finish in that top eight it probably requires you to be top-notch for seven games if you only have to be top-notch for three three games and then gets you into 17th and you play two extra games where you can be top-notch that's five games instead of seven yeah so we we still don't know so don't think that clubs are not very aware of what they can and cannot do and what they may or may not need to do you know we might see rotation in all of the games where City have lower opponents and then by the end of it and then by the end of yeah and then by the end they might just yeah they'll just get through in 15th 16th or something they'll get Sparta whoever in the playoffs and go well we can still roll out Harlem for 60 minutes here and it's fine they may just be able to cruise these they may just be able to cruise that it's going to be interesting to see who's going to do that so yeah and you might see a lot of halftime subs and all sorts of stuff as well any 4 minutes take him off yeah the Champions League we don't know the impact of that this season but having up to five transfers we don't know the impact of that this season true but what what I would say is I said once people have got there like the people that haven't might never get there yeah they might never get there and and and I know you know there's a analytic friend JC was saying about you know the fourth and fifth transfer honest valuable Ballers though they're not so saving and saving and saving for the sake of saving isn't but if you do happen to stumble to get there it's such a strong position yeah you know that's going to have to be the the big old benefit of doing it so let obviously you've got to look at you got Arsenal to work out cityand to work out yeah harand yeah say City hland harand to work out yeah I mean all the you will want the others but it's like which are the ones we want like if OD guards odard is likey it sounds like you know out for these two Plum fixtures it's like do you need it as much yeah it's not like it's not like it's not like Tren and Robo next week a away at walls is a terrible fixture is it no no um maybe we just get the ones that we definit well and that should be our motto most of the time anyway is is is you don't have to just get the numbers from someone get the right players yeah yeah I've definitely got to make a sacrifices to get Harland in that's obviously that's obviously for sure um but whether I can wait a week as well and then get that you know that that game week seven fixed to Liverpool which is you know even Palace away you know it's not like salah's ever had a bad history at C Park is it even if he starts on the bench so yeah I mean that game he start on the bench was that 17 points 16 points 16 25 minutes yeah that was mad Madness but that's where we are that's where we are for game week five um grad if you're watching that's my team uh locked in so just get that in there um we did well on the plan to go for half an hour it's currently been 52 minutes that's as good as it gets for us less than an hour let's get out of here thanks very much see you all remember if you do enjoy the content from us make sure you hit the like button if you want to see more from us hit subscribe and good luck for gameweek 5 see you guys later see you later [Music]",9106,la right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam and as always joined by baker evening mate how are you very well mate very well very well saturday deadline first thursday night its all pretty straightforward until game week 9 so were pretty chilled at the moment looking to bounce back is where i am at the moment looking to bounce back its been a busy week and i havent been able to think about fpl so im cool im happy that im in a position where im comfortable with rolling my transfer havent had any dramas over the over the no dramas yet no dramas yet well yet i dont have any arsenal players so thats cool there still theres still pressers there still saturday le city plus theyre play on each other and the only issue i have a guess is j pedro at the moment but we can talk about that we can talk about thats fine but im im im im looking good i think but i thought that last week how did you feel about spurs last night no why m you didnt say you were gonna ask about tottenham yesterday to be honest i watched it because we were doing we were doing something with the patrons last night i wont mention it because of all the stuff going on but i was doing stuff with the patrons last night so i had it on in the background and i was just bored like the whole thing was just boring just rubbish and then it was if you have seen if anyone seen those those memes that are going around which is like this is the what is it like im excited to see my team play i want to kill myself nice we won like thats the timeline of every tot fan and my boss at work is a centry fan so he sent me a message he was like dont do not mention the game last night i said to be honest id wiped it from my memory i was not even going to mention it there no its a problem i tell you if we hadnt turned that around going into that this weekend and then we lost this weekend then it would have got real nasty is you can only have so many games of 70 possession its like i say it accelerate everything because its quite boring when youve got 70 possession but still look like a team thats going to concede its its weird i think its weird that we managed to re we managed to recycle the ball in the most boring way and we have done it for i think i feel like weve done it for 15 years mate yes like and it doesnt matter who we have in terms of personnel or management it doesnt matter its just exactly the same thing weve seen it so many times but look if you if you have that amount of possession every game then the bookies will probably like you as were about to see they do like us this weekend and at some point especially if there was an early goal it can click we saw that in the everton game orbe it brenford is probably a pretty stern test other than that is everyone getting injured can i claim that i predicted everyones going to get injured of course you can unfortunately theyre all mine what did you say like just hamstrings just go hamstrings just go they just go they vanish they just vanish its happened to a lot its happened to a lot of your players im seeing a lot of people luke missing sending messages out or tweets out saying pray for me wow i saw i saw i saw he when i saw lukes team earlier and if you feel him bad go look at lukes team because he makes my team its the only person ive seen where im like thats more issues than ive got so far lets lets see how the week lets see the week plays out but what would you make of the eack stuff what did you say it was like a toe injury or just not training i dont know its a bit weird we love conspiracies and well probably get sued at some point one day but my only thing right if im being skeptical it he got he got in the nose mh theres if you were thinking why did it go off at half time the word concussion might come out of your mouth but the game was a half four game on a sunday and the game on saturdays a 300 game was less than six less than six days so its like concussion would be kashion would be gone for the following week as well it would be but then its like is it my eye and now is it my toe and im like is eddie just making stuff up here to try and get away from the fact that he probably was concussed its its all very odd and even that toe injury which youve seen its probably worth noting craig hopu who wrote the article i think in the daily mail today craig h hopes normally pretty good as a journal for newcastle but he was doing it from a paid subscription version of the daily mail that and the only way that someones getting going to sign up or do that payroll to have a look at it is hey guess what if were a little sensationalist because i did see what was in that article i didnt pay the daily mail but i did see what was in that article and the end of it says but newcastle i hope for he will lead the line on saturday i dont know its its a taffy it is and we thing is well get nothing get nothing from how tomorrow either no did you al did you also see c did the photoshop of him with a ey patch on i did not our friend c did a i now have to look at this brilliant photo shop of him with it on despite the fact hes in the old castor kit so its an old kit right its its not recent and he sent me it beforeand like should i tweet this like and then loads of people believed it loads of people have believed that hes wearing his ipad so good and theres some amazing ones in there alexanda is in is in like the pirate isac i saw it was turfy topper said alex it should just be called alexander sack now because hes got no eye wa its thats its its the facial expression its the teeth its everything its just perfection isnt it so course a good man a good man but yes he hasnt got an ey patch just in case anyone does wonder that one brilant 121000 views on that incredible brilliant its never going to stop love it j pedro so he wasnt in the squad he wasnt sorry wasnt he wasnt in the squad car was he no hler said he was training but he just needed a few days i enjoy that again the narrative also is that him not being in the he wt be in the squad pretty much every player that could be in the squad of every squad this week was in the squad they just sit on the bench they still go they just sit on the bench thats thats it so if he if he could play he still would have sat on the bench like he would have like but he wasnt ready to play thats thats the obvious bit of it what we dont know is a couple more days does that make him ready to play and then its a question as well the next of geo was cup tight so he couldnt play at all so his direct replacement is as fresh as a daisy and hes not like it i dont know i dont know i dont know on that like you for example you probably have a very good first sub potentially on it but for you i dont think its something where you should be looking at doing something with it no but for those that are riant on them and have a transfer in hand and dont have any issues and potentially a wild card i think i consider it i think i would consider making a move on it but his last minutes were what two weeks ago or a week ago a week it was about a week ago wasnt it from today like the 11th did that is that when brazil played because he played like 15 minutes like that so he hasnt played in a week and theyre not playing until sunday i think yes im sitting here as you say with him and with decent enough bench hes likely to be an a n or star isnt he i dont i dont suspect its a cameo type space but i think were too early to be saying he could be rested for forest and then just so they have him for i dont know if its question rested its a question of weather what what not rested like given the additional time to recover from injury but if hes not ready to start if he is only got 20 30 minutes on him then like we dont know cu we didnt know we didnt know why he wasnt playing in the first place it was a complete shock that sudden like hes not playing so you dont it might be worth looking back at presses from hler already because hes one of those that we dont know about yet still so maybe we should have a look back and maybe one of the scout guys can have a look back and see how he might get he might get particularly lucky they just say and hes important hes going to start exactly that but if he doesnt as i said ive seen a lot of people that are well carding in game week six and they have him and theyre like i want to roll this week so that ive got it i dont i dont know i dont know when vardy and dcl are just sitting there with a good game against each other pick your poison which one you want and k is playing almost certainly playing this week against man united scored in midweek as well so hes that monkeys off his back he can he can get on with scoring goals in the league now no problem and for people with money in the bank sans got a good game all those type of stuff like i think if i had no issues and i was sitting on him and i didnt get any positive news i would be tempted okay not for you cuz no would you its not just me and you talking here is it well or be it consider everyone else if you looked if you looked past this week the question is cal leen or with some good fixtures or vard evertons fixtures are fantastic in fairness but theyre in and out lesters arent theres some games where its like i definitely wouldnt and theres some games definitely would but get it get it in terms of in terms of chasing if someone wanted to wanted to move off this week this is the week to do it you could just go chriswood you could just go you could just go back just go back to chris wood and we talked about those first three fixtures being so good brighton this week which is probably fine its okay its tough but its its probably the toughest game theyll have in the next five chelsea aside maybe fulham and palace and leicester so its good fixtures there should we pull the fix up we can pull the fixes

this is the market data that comes from spreadex that tells us how many goals are expected to be scored by a team and the percentage chance of a clean sheet being expected goals its in a decimal format so please dont expect liverpool to score 27 goals on saturday and then its done as a mat on a matchup basis so you can see you can see how the markets predict the match going and for us like every week well concentrate on the teams that are predicted to score over two goals and this week we have liverpool comfortably at 27 tottenham at 23 and villa at 21 and then when youre looking at the defense it wasnt the greatest week for defensive predictions last week we could saw goals and it played out that way is only arsenal defenders got anyone any defensive points not many to shout about for many others unless you had the maybe or brighton guy this this week liverpool at 40 chance of a clean and then you start moving into villa 34 brighton 34 totam 31 city still 34 at home to man city against arsenal is thats interesting because i assumed everyone with rico lewis would just bench rico lewis for example but it be very difficult i imagine to get any indication of whether he starts or not but people with like vard what you doing with him week probably starting is the question is the thing if you got v you got a starting i think we need to see we need to see whether peps going to play with vardal certainly with v certainly going to be rico its going to be about whether we whether were going to get a leakers whether he starts although say saying that i dont think viio this is not a week where v gets rested right for sure like last week so it is it is walker or lewis and lewis plays lewis played in in the week against inter right you have to assume that this is a walker game it just feels like everything about it feels like a walker game doesnt it arsenal still got up against martinelli like r back rice is back but ards still out so is it we is it going to be martin ell or is it going to be trossard thats probably isnt it play hard in the middle wouldnt you if odard i imagine i cant depends you going theyre going to play theyre going to play two sixes again surely they play they going play three sixes so they play rice as like almost the eight and then party and youro because you got to play three in the middle but then you cant play trossard because you play you dont you dont you dont play trossard thats what im saying you either stink it up with three sixes or you play dard okay so you just assume left rather than trossard left and sacka right and hs up top well you wouldnt play trossard with three sixes didnt the only reason you play 3 sixes is then to have some width wouldnt you alongside it so i just think martinelli is almost guaranteed to play the left wing because of the fact of maybe they start it with 3 sixes and then bring tr then youve got trossard option havent you you either bring him on just for martinelli in the 60th minute like they like to do all the time or you bring him on for georgino probably thats probably what theyre going to do im like if youre the question is like is on captaincy more than anything is like harland like how would you feel looking at harland here versus like salah in thats thats thats the big one right its not its not a question is its not it shouldnt be it shouldnt be like would i be surprised if harand braced no because youre not surprised if the person who plays for the best team one of the best teams in the world braak is in any game and hes the best striker in the world so youre never going to be surprised about it but you got to play the odds on this and look at it and so sm it what would you do if what would you personally do you havent got harland but if you had a leak that said that mo wasnt starting on saturday where you go then probably id probably cap trent like id probably kep i wouldnt feel great about it but i probably kept tren im trying to think youre now asking me whos in my team and wheres your v going to it trent trent maybe salanki maybe salanki to be honest palmer west ham palmer away at west ham last week was a bit iffy wasnt it so i dont know me is with harand its got to be salanki i probably would list im probably still going to leave my advice on harland but we assume thats youve got both if youve got both no if youve got both its capal vice harand and move on but well get the info saturday morning i think the good thing for liverpool is that theyve got caravell next week against west ham not an easy fixture at all for them west ham will be definitely its for most teams now its the carabat was like the best like the best but also quite a competitive way to get a trophy isnt it weve seen teams we didnt make we made a few quite a few changes but its still a relatively good team weve seen teams like palace this week go in with almost a full strength team i expect west h to put out a good team its such a its such a weird one that league cut because everyone talks about everyone talks about the fa cup being the one like being the one because every single team in the country can access it and at the same at the same time you enter at the same time as all of the other premier league teams so but youve got a pool of youve got a pool of teams at that point where you could pull out an anan bur right or a f like leis or a folkton invictor like that its hard to win the carabel thats why all the good teams win its the league cup its played out by the best teams in the flipping country like its not its a complete ruse everyone field into the che the semifinal and stuff like that like doesnt that doesnt exist well it could exist but it doesnt exist but you would expect for liverpool the sensible thing is they put the main team that have been playing out on saturday they bring in the people like g po and darwin for the west ham game and then you go back again on the league they got they got plenty though like you could you could build that you could build that team bradley simas all those guys theyre theyre all there the question the question we dont know with slot what he could do is he could mix a match couldnt he so he could make a couple of changes this week so that he plays a couple of his main guys in midweek and we just dont know until like we have no idea this weekend we have no idea how those managers that managed in europe will rotate their squads going into the weekend at the same time city have won four in a row and liverpool lost last weekend like i dont its not a week where its not a week where you can just let a team let a few players go no and just say the rest boys if theres one player that youre worried about for liverpool is the player that ive got diego doter like he is a worry but hes probably also only ever 603 anyway thats all you ever say so for me with jotter i dont see that i will be taking jotter out even if we got a leak that he wasnt starting ill probably just i probably just let it happen and hope that the 30 minutes a goal could can do so much cant it what like goal scorers are now getting most of them are getting like one or two bonus just from getting a goal so it he could still easy score an 8 n pointer he can also score a onep pointer thats just the way thats the way it goes but if i was to hit him to someone then that players got to immediately get a return havt they thats thats quite tough doesnt definitely definit doesnt feel like its worth it like if youre cuz youre wild card in next week almost certainly so i wouldnt be taking out players that play this week no i definitely will be playing i definitely will cs as soon as i get the chance def so youre not youre not taking any players out to play this week if youre going to make a punt at all you take out a player thats not going to play they not going to play completely or it had has low upside so munis for example we dont know if he plays or not but youd expect the fact that he played the carabal in midweek that he wouldnt start this weekend that he wouldnt start this weekend you expect that and its not a great week for him even if he did even if he did start hes hes now what a 60 70 minute player on a 14 expected goals so hes a relatively easy enough move my only thing on jta where id be like well maybe i could take a hit would be if i shifted down on him but enabled me to get salanki okay because 23 expected goals is a lot or it meant even as far as get watkins for some people there might have some money in the bank and it might be enough to do it if i was to take a cheap mid punt this week well ask you the question before i tell you who i like any cheap mid punts that would stand out for you that you like so mina potentially who do you have in your team you have rogers already right ive got rogers ahad maybe i dont i think ahmads not a bad shout and he ammad is how low i would have to go ammad gives me exact money to get to watkins thats like as low as i could go i dont think theres anyone cheaper than that you that you that youd want to go to if i was guy a little bit more i am quite tempted with koseski at 6 3 interesting he has to he has to start after yesterday hes our best player hes our best play like hes the only good goody there youve got you got dwight mc say you just go dwight mcneil of course got dwight mcil hes not enough hes not enough for me to get to get to and all these players youre like right taking a hit on these rather than necessarily jot a 30 minutes its a bit its a bit icky well theres the reason theyre price to where they are but if i wanted to fully lead in spurs bias and just say right tottenham its on you how my weekend goes mate we do that every weekend anyway i could minus four j and munes to salagi and koseski thats given me a headache already its the most horrific thing ive ever thought of in my entire life man that is so that is so bad it is bad someone saying hutchinson someone saying dibling like lets not southampton playing it i dont i dont care i care so little about this game from a pick perspective i dont theyre both bad teams theyre both bad underline numbers that said that said itwi have had the two toughest games but weve got weve got quite number of games here where its relatively tight looks like a 21 in one way or another and were not sure fham newcastle looks like a 21 leester villa looks like a 21 even villa walls potentially is a 21 maybe that could be a 20 or a 31 type space southampton it swit either way alice man united either way even man city arsenal could be a 21 it does look like the common 15 super six two ons all over the place look like look like the ways this weekend apart from liverpool so youve got youve got to push with that i think and salah just cap just feels obvious to me and whoever youve got you got a plan i do think i do think theres going to be some rotation i am i am worried about im worried about josh im worried about rogers i think i think he played 90 minutes again whenever everybody else is coming off he played another 90 minutes hes playing 90 minutes all the time hes a young guy weve seen it so often a young guy just suddenly it be like i just played youran this week alongside him like we shouldnt think it just doesnt happen every all i see on twitter everyone being like is this the week hes going to return and im like i hope so i hope so but also he just might not start same on m you looked at you mentioned earlier but dingu just keeps scoring like he played 82 minutes m in the caribel now dingle played 0 so thats that should mean that hes okay for it but those minutes are getting shakier for some of these guys if rogers continues to not return and jan does at some point they go why dont we just start jan and then and then bring rogers on i dont think i dont think its a problem with what hes creating though like everything looks good when hes on the pitch it thats thats a positive thing and the fact that chances arent being converted isnt always his issue no but he is he isnt scoring and he very often but well hes often there as the second receiver thats what weve talked about it repeatedly that hes often or it would get to him but it doesnt get to him cuz what just gets in the way of the ball type stuff like he is he is effectively a second striker like hes not an out and out sit on the wing beat your man winger thats not what he is he is in and amongst it you could quite easily just play youran and watkins any week like at some point it can happen baileys back ramsey can play out wide right it its its got it does youre right it does have to happen that needs to get a start i dont think hes its not almost not fair for him to not is it to have done what hes done in the minutes that hes had he must be just turning around like come on gaffa its its so much more its so much more painful to us that rogers wouldnt start then it would be to rogers or his teammates like theyd be absolutely fine with it fine i played 9 minutes in midweek ill just sit on the bench this week im still in the game its everyones happy with me im a kid but other than that its its a tough i think theres very few players that id want to move heaven on earth for this weekend i think up front salan and watkins are the clear boys that youve got to be trying to get in if you had to pick one of dcl or vardy this week where you be for one week one week for one week i would pick dcl i would pick dcl interesting i think everton have been good look the defensively theyve had theyve had been a nightmare theyve scored four goals in the last two games its not an issue from a goal scoring position point of view cavon is getting into positions which are good and he is missing chances but he is scoring chances as well that is the one thing in it vardy did score last week but it was his only shot of the game ive ive ive gone back and forth on this because in my best case situation this week i simply move moon is to one of dcl or vardy thats my best case situation unless i would have a real big decision to make so if somehow he is h said i pedro starting then that changes everything but the idea that he would just come out and say that he definitely is starting is very difficult lets lets move to lets move to our teams lets move to our teams because i think weve covered pretty much everyone there and as we do that atlanta have missed a penalty perfect thats just what we wanted to hear lets start with you mate yes heres the pain so yes if people havent seen or heard or listened to the fact that i got pain this week i have the lovely henderson in goal against his old club man united maybe hell take that as a little extra incentive to do okay then ive got porro anthony robinson and gabrielle my other defenders other than gabrielle are leis hall who i just cant see him playing leis hall up against adama can you play lloyd kelly against ad wouldnt you away from home i wouldnt be confident i wouldnt be confident playing lloyd kelly against ad dharma would you be would you be more confident im playing lis hall against him its probably as bad as each other probably its probably as bad as each other to be honest its not its not exactly unless youre have they got any other fit center backs because you wouldnt you wouldnt even want to play dan burn against him would you either way id still p i still gonna go gabrielle over leis hall or ben johnson no thats fine so its bad no trent already straight away no robo they were good last week mate they were good last week so gordon and again like if isach is out the last thing i want is gordon playing for 9 again that was just horrible so id like to hope they play aula and then gordon can be more of the main man around it but gordons potentially not good and gordon is up against anthony robinson who im playing cant win then ive got rogers ive got j ive got salah got munes i got isack i got harland for me looking at this is the reason i didnt start with salah was i probably didnt have enough robust picks around it to run a salo and harland team and thats what im exactly what im seeing here is the second ive brought him in im like god everything else is unstable that is the problem of running of running as teams is the edges look so painful like if someones on wild card now next week and you want to run the seller and harland and continue to run it just look at the other players that are in my team today and have that in your mind like nailed is so important when youve got those type of players moon has got to go isack might have to go its its a tough week mate its a tough week but you just have to hope dont you it worked i had an appalling looking team last week and got away with it realistically parand and mo do lots of stuff you just need a couple of goals dont you a parro banger a gordon a gordon hall and itll be okay nothing it could be bad and if it is bad if i lose so well have look at this sec so im expected to get 52 points im so gl im i tell you what im so glad im so glad that you went to that expected points number just then because about two minutes ago i realized that captain was on harland and ive just changed the image because it was on 49 it was on 49 i was like that is mad because i know mines like way above that but anyway a lot of this is probably because youve got youve got a lot of players playing against each other here youve got harand against gabrielle youve got gordon against and esack against robinson thats not thats thats the heding i hate mate i a got no choice mate well i know you dont but just say i got no choice thats thats thats why and but you can you can never protect hedging for so long can you can protect it for two or three weeks you cant protect it in week five what is by that time its its long gone so theres a couple of questions in the chat before your about like wild card this week and what would you do if you were the wild card i think dan said it was on wild card bosy mentioned it and all that stuff is similar one of the things adding things ive said there is i dont like the mo and harland drafts i still dont like it and i dont feel like and as soon as you come out of this week im so much heavier leaning harland than mo and therefore i cant see that id want to make that huge decision for when those two guys are so good that they can they can cover any week weve seen it so yes do would i expect to get somewhere between 10 to 20 war points this week if i wild card yes because i would have a very similar team probably to what adams about to show is but i also have only have one free transfer which i use this week so ill still have one track transfer so i its been such an unstable position if i wild carded im better to take im better to lose 20 points to the crowd this week than i am to wild card because otherwise im just im patching and im still patching next week im still patching next week and im never getting to that position whereas theres theres lot between 6 and 12 theres a lot of shift there some big shifts going around so i feel like i feel like you need and game week five is not one of those shifts right thats the thing and because its not one of those if you use a chip like this in this particular week then its going to be hard to maneuver the change in game week six for arsenal then in game we seven for city and then coming out of arsenal in game week n like thats the tough thats diff thats the stuff that is difficult to do if you dont have either a chip or transfers so youre going to even had two transfers in the bank id think about it i definitely would think about it id probably just still use those transfers if im honest but having one nah its like youre just saying im going to be but im again im right up against it this week and im still going to be up against it going forward ive got to try and ive got to try and get some validation as i said if i take a million rank drop this week then i take a million rank drop this week its fine you me so so im just touch on the expected points there i was looking mines up at 603 so my plan here is to is to roll assuming that we get no further information that makes this worse but ive got martinez in goal now home fixture against wolves hes very likely to concede because thats what martinez does hes probably better than he got a 34 chance which is better than all bar one keeper this weekend exactly double liverpool defense robertson trent is the best two chances of play and then pedro porro who also has over a 30 chance its its three hit teamers and then midfield bruno salak cap rogers e and and co pala and then salanki and then jaia pedro up front i say ive got entia on the bench no drama if i want to bring him in i got leaf davis on the bench no real drama if i want to bring him in lewis i probably just wouldnt the only thing its interesting is its tough its tough because as we say i think if arsenal stink it up right and it and they playing for this nil like lewis is a good pick lewis is a good pick this week because youre going to get the option youre going to get good chance of a clean sheet plus he finds pockets right hes the a player that wants to get into pockets and if hes doing little dances with phil foden in the middle there as they as theyre trying to get around the arsenal defense he could be in and around that intricate passing that ends up in a crea chance or ends up in a shot so i dont think hes as bad a pick as long as we get the information that he starts and then and that and thats my team i dont i want to have four transfers going into next week i want to be able to shift over to a couple of aral players minimum it would be ins i think even if they said pedros out until after the next international break i still dont think id make a transfer now more look you look at that youre like god i would bite your arm off for any of those three on your bench this week but i but ive wild carded so its fine i ive had ive had to make this plan because ive wild carded and so im its such a strong like this team by the way 23 points last week 23 well thats thats like i say everybodys team was 23 points if they didnt have one or two players last week everybodys team was that its just so happens one of them a lot of people kept him and its its in a very robust position for the next few weeks and i was trying to get my head round it earlier that the idea that you from next week so youll have four transfers next week mhm so you could make i could make five transfers i could make five transfers for a minus four but thats the in my opinion right thats the stupid stuff like where we need to change our brain is i think everyone said if ive got free transfers i used to make that mini wild card well i can make a mini wild card well thats just showing your hand thats just going all in like i dont get it right what you could do is do two free transfers next week then pick up another one and then pick up another one and then you could do two free transfers the week after you just do two and roll two and roll two do it for like youll be able to do it for four weeks in a row like that is such an unbelievable thing so lets say everyones like be straight into their brain of like what i could do is like make four or five transfers and be thats not as strong as doing two transfers every week for three or four weeks and where you dont need to do them dont do them because the likelihood is every time you make two transfers you probably dont need to make a transfer the week after like once youre there in that holy grail territory like i dont know i dont know that ill ever make it there cuz ive never ive never made it there before so whats to say that ill never make it exactly un this could just be where people that get to four just surf the wave to 38 and i think is i think the worst thing that people could do is use three or four in a week once a gone because if you use three four in a week and you had a week where you had two injuries or suddenly just the game changed youre like ah okay the beauty is that weve got we know were planning were planning moves to an extent but at the same time major things can happ like if this was a week where i get three injuries for example i can i can navigate that and i can i can move i can move around that quite easily and i think as long as long as like crazy weeks like this dont happen which invariably they will because were going to get more games coming up although listening to some of the people talk about how teams are going to navigate these europa like champions league like this is something interesting that i heard so city lets say city you have to finish in the top eight right to avoid that playoff which is two games but if you finish 17th or 16th or 17th you do qualify but you have to play two extra games so what does it requ require to finish in that top eight it probably requires you to be topnotch for seven games if you only have to be topnotch for three games and then gets you into 17th and you play two extra games where you can be topnotch thats five games instead of seven so we still dont know so dont think that clubs are not very aware of what they can and cannot do and what they may or may not need to do we might see rotation in all of the games where city have lower opponents and then by the end of it and then by the end of and then by the end they might just theyll just get through in 15th 16th theyll get sparta whoever in the playoffs and go well we can still roll out harlem for 60 minutes here and its fine they may just be able to cruise these they may just be able to cruise that its going to be interesting to see whos going to do that so and you might see a lot of halftime subs and all sorts of stuff as well any 4 minutes take him off the champions league we dont know the impact of that this season but having up to five transfers we dont know the impact of that this season true but what i would say is i said once people have got there like the people that havent might never get there they might never get there and i know theres a analytic friend jc was saying about the fourth and fifth transfer honest valuable ballers though theyre not so saving and saving and saving for the sake of saving isnt but if you do happen to stumble to get there its such a strong position thats going to have to be the big old benefit of doing it so let youve got to look at you got arsenal to work out cityand to work out harand say city hland harand to work out all the you will want the others but its like which are the ones we want like if od guards odard is likey it sounds like out for these two plum fixtures its like do you need it as much its not like its not like its not like tren and robo next week a away at walls is a terrible fixture is it no maybe we just get the ones that we definit well and that should be our motto most of the time anyway is you dont have to just get the numbers from someone get the right players ive definitely got to make a sacrifices to get harland in thats thats for sure but whether i can wait a week as well and then get that that game week seven fixed to liverpool which is even palace away its not like salahs ever had a bad history at c park is it even if he starts on the bench so that game he start on the bench was that 17 points 16 points 16 25 minutes that was mad madness but thats where we are thats where we are for game week five grad if youre watching thats my team locked in so just get that in there we did well on the plan to go for half an hour its currently been 52 minutes thats as good as it gets for us less than an hour lets get out

13,AboveAverageFPL,FTE5f0QINDE,FPL GW4 Reaction - Worst Gameweek Of The Season* | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-09-15T22:43:31Z,[Music] n [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always joined by Baker hi mate how you doing that was not sincere no it wasn't at all wasn't at all it was you last week it's me this week yeah but a lot of people turn up here misery loves company mate misery loves company that is that is exactly right and there's already 120 people in here because you know everyone wants to hear about how fantastically we did this week and uh and our takes on the fact that Tottenham failed to win the or even draw the north London Derby basically and I'm struggling like my weekend has just been been horrific like if you could describe a weekend like this is just like terrible my wife literally ended it with like the sun came out I was like well that's good yeah that's positive but everything else was just crap just rubbish give us the wakad give us the wakad um okay so obviously I wake up yesterday morning with a bit of a cold and I've been struggling today sore throat everything I had my head in a bowl earlier with um with Vick trying to clear my nose and stuff just to make sure that I don't just to make sure that I'm all right tonight um then I played golf yesterday as well so went out there tough track sorry is a tough it's a tough track yeah you showed me scores there before it's aough TR yeah tough track I've never broken 84 there so shot 90 um wife told me to go out because the weather was going to be good and it rained I like this makes no sense uh all my FPL assets did absolutely nothing harand obviously smashed it I mean I expected him to do that anyway so that's fine um and then North London Derby so yeah that's been been my weekend just uh yeah just a load of rubbish really how was your weekend slightly better good good slightly better slightly better but you know hey my weeks my my my only reason I have a green arrow this morning is because is or this evening is because of the goal against Tottenham from Gab with my team yeah and I was saying to I think I mentioned it in the chat just at the start um that uh well in yeah literally in the chat before we were setting up that I only realized you had Gabrielle in your team when I was setting up the Pod I hadn't had a look I didn't even take any didn't hadn't actually noticed that you had him in there so much so that I had to double check your team ID to make sure that I got the right one I was like he doesn't have Gabrielle surely I ain't got a lot of choice mate we'll see my team in a minute but I was close I was close hitting him out for robo um imagine because I had two weeks you know effectively before wild card and you were like does Robo Score Four Points more than he does in those two weeks and I was like probably probably but there was always the chance of what happened today there was always that chance and there's always a chance that the other part I started thinking about was what if Rober doesn't made the second game what if Rober plays this one then ched and all you know Gabriel play and I was like I've got no bench and I'm just I'm just I'm just surviving just surviving basically week week to week at the moment and I was just trying I was really hoping I could just roll through next week I'll be okay that's not happening I'm definitely making a transfer next week so it will be another transfer next week I really don't want a wild card next week it's a it's we talked last week about this was a good week to Wild Card mhm it looked it you know next week does not not look a good week to Wild Card at all in terms of swings of fixes I've got no issues with my team like actually the team itself I've got no issues whatsoever with it just got got no returns no returns this week but but when you look at it you know this week's really being so if you had a h in cap you're okay you're okay you're fine if you had harand and capsella it's probably not you need something else you need you need a Gabrielle you need a Watkins you need a mateta other than that you need Ry still in go because nobody's got you know not many people have got Mich is 11 pointer that he gets or nanas or ORS or Sanchez you know what I mean no one's got those so therefore um no one's got DD eight points do you know what I mean those things are not the things that are coming in so it's just you needed something and if you had a couple of things you were okay if you had more than a couple of things you did amazing um if you got ESR Off the Bench I hate you uh the Gabriel Gabriel oh the Gabriel the Gabriel for sh Pedros was just were just disgusting I saw them I saw I saw someone take isaach out to get Pedro in so they could afford Salah and then obviously didn't have isack but and got and then also got gabri off the bench so they got Salah can't even turn around thing is I can't even turn around now and say like where's my luck because I had it in game week to to some extent I definitely feel like in the start of the Season that it is huge Wings luck is huge wings and it feels it hurts more because any return is like monster drop or Monster you know gain it's it's still big and what you will see is you know we're already starting to see like we're four weeks in and some people I've just ridden the wave yeah yeah like I was looking at it thinking feel like I've done all right I'm Treading Water right like if I want it to be top 10K it's 55 more points to me now already 55 points four weeks I was literally in it in it I I must be I must be I must be the only person that was in well probably not the only but the only like relatively ious manager that was in the top 10K after two weeks and then he's now outside the top two million but it's not just like like football and fpo it's the same things in it certain small little things make such huge things we've seen it so you know Southampton miss a penalty well man united like like it was we we'll talk about it just flat lines immediately you know is same with Bournemouth you know couldn't couldn't have been doing more do that oops um just the so many any little things they don't go your way you get hurt and uh that's why we turn up on Sundays to talk about it indeed indeed so um yeah I didn't tell you I had this but um I'd half started putting it together and then I get a text from someone saying oh by the way mate if you'd have if you'd have done nothing if you'd have done nothing you'd have got 73 points I deliberately hadn't asked you I hadn't I hadn't I hadn't asked you this CU cuz we've had the conversation before had you done it and stuff like that and done the counting up and what's the point in that um but yeah this is literally the if I was hit by a bus I would be in the top 40K right now like there's Rya Gabrielle Bruno Smith row Haren cap that that would literally be it if I'd have been hit by a bus and You' have four transfers next week and i' have four transfers next week and my Wild Card yeah come on then M but but be nice to people this is what I keep saying it but like don't be a dick to say oh oh if you haven't done that because we're all gonna we're all going to have to face this we all are this is some of the problem is we are all going to have to press that button and that's that's what really got me the fear this week I was so close topress I talked about it quite a lot with our boy Spaceman we talked we talked through Wild Card a lot um he's got a relatively similar team orbe his looks a bit nicer than mine um but a lack of Liverpool same as me um and I was pretty close pretty close to to maybe pressing the button but it was I just kept thinking well well maybe maybe and it's it's tough but at some point I'll press it and I mean we've all been there before we pressed it in the first week of wild cards absolutely terrible yeah hopefully yeah if next week it bounces back because it looks so much better than non Wild Card teams next week um or forgiven absolutely if it doesn't then Ang angry yeah so let's just go by let's

quickly shout your score out and we move on right showing the scores and reading out for people that are listening so yeah I had 23 points on my wild card yay uh went down to about two .2 million rank uh Martinez picked him for the fixtures cheers uh got booked as well thanks very much Trent won Robinson one Lewis one um was all pretty happy when you know he the starting lineup wasn't too wasn't too fussed about that and then then the halftime sub wasn't ideal uh Rogers he's just points dodging like he's better at points dodging than Bruno right now he's fantastic he to watch just just does doesn't score any points uh Salah captain four points did nothing e um could have taken a penalty didn't take the penalty two points Palmer three Bruno with my only Return of the game week which was an assist um wow it's the only return I had across the entire team and then intia who had six shots and still nothing and then salanki today that that header as it crept past the post nightmare obviously I Pedro in there sank came in there's an auto sub I got Johnson Pedro parro and in fact my highest scoring player is leaf Davis and he sits third on my bench wonderful that's weit mate that's for the ages for the ages well been four weeks mate and you've had one of the best weeks I've ever seen and one of the most painful weeks I've ever seen that's how that's how I played the game mate that's it's just that is how play if anyone listens or watched the end of season review we did last season I think I said something like you play the game in a way that does enable you to have massive highs and big pain well you I didn't think that this I didn't think that this move was going to provide the big pain though I didn't I didn't think we envision that no but there's always one if there's always one guy that potentially can always do it then it's the person who's got 26 points out of my 55 and that's earing Harland um and um I got 55 points but realistically yeah 41 points of it it's Gabrielle and Holland and then everyone else it's the same one points for my other two forward isak and mun one points from doter one point from a keeper two pointers all around lay wipe out for Robinson Perfect Mate two pointers look fantastic I don't you're Strikers mate you don't mind it if it's like Defenders you get it they they can lose points it's true when you got the Liverpool number nine the Newcastle number nine and the FIP number nine and they get fre points between them you're like good two two of them only got 45 minutes in for various for different reasons which isn't IDE they got they they basically got about 115 minutes between them incredible M's got about 20 he's got 45 and 59 J J get yeah J got 59 didn't he that half time okay cool right some 15 minutes which is pretty good for us getting onto the games let's go let's do it and then on to the second game we don't need about North are we do we I think we should I think we should um I tell you what literally apart from the goal I enjoyed the whole game I genuinely did I thought I thought we were well in control and I didn't feel like we were going to have that control but we did and I thought it was a decent game for for Tottenham fan to watch I was never really felt like I was in any danger except every time the ball went out for a corner and like when the ball goes out for a corner after 21 seconds I'm like oh Christ here we go and then we defend a few and we we look a bit more Resolute and everything looks all right and yeah it I think it's okay but the one big thing that we're not doing is we're just not creating chances of high enough quality now there's a there is a caveat here that Arsenal's defense is better than most defenses you play against so maybe that is what happens in a game like this but at the same time this is not the first time we've seen it and I think it's going to be a concern going forward so even though I'm I'm still high on salanki for the next few weeks you know there's not enough there's not enough data there's not enough information for me to say that sank is not going to be a good pick in that position I'm just worried maybe about you know the the the types of the types of balls he's going to get the type of I can't think of the word the distribution he's going to get yeah yeah it it feels quite slow and progressing and therefore like they have a lot of the ball but it's the lot of that ball is with Romero vaner van through to the center midfielders I did feel like I feel like we didn't try and trap him at all you know they were trying to counter us we were a little worried about getting caught on the counter and then it was like we played Just safe ball you kind of knew where the next ball was going all the time you knew when it was going to Romero the next time it was going to go either going to go to Benton CER and then go to parro or it was going to go to Romero then it was just going to go to parro and it was from there it was going to be something into Johnson and then the cross was going to come in low and that's how it was going to be about parro and go high but it sometimes in the first half we did try to find that ball to try to find that that line breaking pass there was but it wasn't frequent enough didn't feel frequent enough their shap was when they're sitting in they're sitting in when they got georgino and party you got to drag up you got to do some things I I do think Benton kir compared to bit basuma when you see it is like basuma will basuma almost draws people in by looking like he's going to lose the ball sometimes and then s Nicks it past people and does stuff so it's it gets people off guard we did paint by numbers the attack quite often you know you knew every time sun got the ball out one on the left he was going to be like right what I'm going to do is quick hold up and come inside on and Ben White and then someone will overlap it but sacker will go with it and it just it was alwayss yeah it's good it's good but it was almost a case of they did let us do that quite a lot they're more than happy to grind out that way yeah they weren't we weren't getting them on the break there was there was a weird we spell was there just before half time about 30 minutes in where suddenly it just got loose for some reason I was like I don't know what's happened here suddenly it was like Ending game for a little bit um but that was about it other than that it was a very control control control and genuinely about two minutes before the goal I was like this just feels like a goal where there's only two ways this is getting decided it's either a set piece or it's a mistake it didn't feel like it was just going to be on Merit straight away something else going to come out it was just going to be set p and then literally up he goes and up we don't go and thanks very much I don't I don't get it I just don't get it and I know you think I've got an agenda against him but I just don't I just don't understand him in his own box this this is this this for everybody here is that is that Adam hates Romero uh it's not that I hate Romero it's that I hate the fact that he cannot head he he cannot head the ball when he's defending like from set pieces from crosses nothing like he just he positionally terrible he's for a guy that walks around with his chest out is just weak in contact and yeah I understand you know what you were saying earlier which was you know surely we put the tallest guy on there blood blah which is which is correct but Cel is also a threat so I don't understand it's not the threat though is he Gabrielle's the threat this what this one is is is my this one is is that Gabrielle is the threat the threat of threats the one that you're going to concede to if if if any if you do the perfect stuff one you still to ConEd is Gabrielle and tottenham's big problem is that they stick Romero who's not very tall not not big big you know he's not he's he's good at getting on in in the in the opposing box but he's never been good defensively on it but the other guy who's bigger who's 6'4 nobody's nobody's ever seen him head out of set piece ever it's never happened in the history of in the history of his career he's never headed out a set base then maybe that's why he's not defending against the best header in that's a problem isn't it you can't have two Defenders that can't hit a ball yeah I don't I don't I don't disagree I think Romo has to be stronger flaps and stuff but ultimately Harry Kane carried this team on hitting balls yeah and we don't have harri kanane so we''ve got we've you know that it's still a problem that gets exploited when you play the best set pce teams that's that's the problem and you can do you do all the hard work for ages but if you let if you let Gabriel have one header six yards out there's only one 6'4 I mean like this is what I don't I just don't I just don't understand how he allows him into that position though like it's not even it's not even the heading bit that's the problem like the heading bit is the problem but it's not even the heading bit so much did you know like in the first off there was there was one where he was like about 30 yards away from the goal it was like he was on the third row of of the stand before the before it went in and then he sort of comes running in from like absolute miles out they're so good at multiple Target movement like but I don't want to stand here I don't want to sit here like shrugging my shoulder going okay Arsenal have just done that because they're good at that that's not that's not good enough on a day like today right like an can turn around and say like you know the big picture is this that and the other but we should be go we should be looking at this game saying what the [ __ ] has just happened here this is this is just not good enough right this yeah I I don't disagree with it I think it's just I watch a lot of NFL the deliver is great don't get me wrong deliver is great NFL is all set plays right and and when you're when you play a lot of fantasy FFL you're like oh I know that wide receiver is playing that secondary and I know that's it and there's nothing they can do about it they can't go oh I'm just going to Magic and put another one on his shoulders you're like he's going to have a good day and he does and and that's a little bit how Arsenal are they're so good at set plays that if they decide if they it's very very hard when they get it right get the delivery right get the runs right get everything right eventually at some point they get in um and we knew that and the way we we need did to combat that was scoring and we didn't score yeah if you don't score you get done that's that's the history of football yeah and that's that's the same you know against Leicester one new up if you don't score again when you should be for 4 five now up you get done like that's that's the continual problem of an ball is that um it allows you to get done it's a problem next week if we lose to brenford yeah there'll be booze definitely and's in and's in trouble if they lose next week yeah I agree I'm saying they look at that I'm trying to be as impartial as I possibly can definitely a we we're hurting as a team it's it's four points it's not enough it's not enough I mean I mean if you'd have taken these four games and you de said where do you want to be after four games we're turning this into a Spurs pod just just just let's finish on this bit where do you think where do you think would be acceptable after four games like given the fixtures that we had six seven seven points probably yeah let's let's say we win the first two draw at Newcastle and lose today of course we don't accept losing against Arsenal but if you'd have said that first four game seven points like we're three points off that now but it but it's more the way in which we've contrived to do it to ourselves the worst and yeah and then the same I guess on the flip side of that is the way that an is justifying the fact that we've got no points is the fact that we're playing well way that's why it turns toxic if you continually dominate games and get beat it feels like your plan isn't good enough yeah agreed um it's harder to blame the players it's harder to blame the players when the players are on top yeah fair you turn on the manager like that's that is just that's just well it's just it's just a thing that you can change it's it's a thing that you can change thing that you can change man um right but from an asset point of view let's just just close this out from an FPL point of view porro next week um brenford do you feel like that's a good I mean I I if you've got better options no there's no better option there's no better there's literally Liverpool Defenders and there's par that's it for next week in this league there's there's Liverpool options and there's par nobody else is close if you were picking a free hit team next week par would be in it be in everyone's free hit team everybody's that's as you're saying it because you've got options because you just wild card mate well okay fair yeah but if you're on free hit you've got every G you've got every option and everybody would have it I'm not sure I'm not sure everybody would Happ it is obviously the City Arsenal game that gives it the that makes it more difficult for next week just wondering what other games there are next week you still have him well let's do brenford let's go manity brenford let's the next one cool yeah nothing to say on Arsenal Arsenal players um good from gameweek six basically uh let's do brenford where is brenford Man City brenford cool so they've lost their only striker yeah that feels like a big problem so you're telling me your bench power and they got no Strikers not a single stri yeah no that's that's that's fair you know can we talk about the challenge by the way oh I think it's a red I think it's a straight red I didn't I didn't understand it when they when they sort of said it had been checked and everything was fine and the yellow C was okay I I I didn't get that whatsoever like if you're for let's to quote it endangering an opponent and the opponent can't can barely walk off the pitch I mean I think he's I don't think he's he's exactly safe in that moment yeah exactly safe more than safe and it's it's horrible like he's completely killed their game they were so good they come out the blocks they've absolutely gone to town on City for 10 minutes um could have been multip but they're still in the game even though harand scored those two goals they're still in the game um what's it goes I actually had to check myself later in the day that I was like did I go finished 21 because it felt like it finished 41 it was so stroll around knock it around oh maybe get my hat trick maybe get my hatrick type stuff there was no nerves about it at all didn't get into a oh maybe they'll get the late equalizer type space because it completely flatlined them that's because they were playing Man City but but it it it it's huge for them NOA like bumo so you got bumo you got Kevin Sharda you got Fabio cavello you got Le P was play left back not left wing he left back but realistically like they're your people that's what you've got now as as as a as forward options they good run fct is coming up but if it is five six weeks for wha I mean it should be good for boomo because it should mean he's up front yeah he should he should be moving centrally surely and he'll just be flanked by would he not just be flanked by Shard on the left and Le Potter on the right l p play left L part's left and sh's left and sh's left they're both left they're both left well maybe you just play one of them down the middle fabiio Caro as well likes the left they're lacking play the right they might play c as like a false n keep them on the right um but it's definitely it's definitely not a good thing for Bournemouth is it you know he's been absolutely brilliant um he would have been you know a lot of people's game with six wild cards yeah apparently five six weeks is the the old estimates that's to the next International break in it till 9: really yeah at least but yeah um Holland I guess if you think about it before this is is he was expected to score 1.1 XG he's currently overperforming XG he did as expected kind of did as expected like two goals is as you know we spoke about it on on the team election being no one no one really thought it was like a 22 week everyone thought potentially it was like a 10 10 week in terms of terms of points performance and if he scored two goals he gets 13 points that's that's L on now yeah um but he's had he's had some very good chances at the end of the game and I don't know if you saw him at final whistle because I'm pry sure you didn't want to see him be was absolutely livid with Kevin De bruyne because he could have played him in right at the end um and um you know he wanted the hatrick he wanted it um that's I mean that's seeing Arsenal today you know I was still considering looking at him from that game and thinking could you cap him next week game the game's going to be the game's going to be completely different next week I mean it's going to be City's first proper test cuz Chelsea were Chelsea were Chelsea were ragged right Chelsea were ragged at the start of the season um and still sort of figuring stuff out they still are um so yeah I think next week will be a completely different game I'll be really interesting to see what they do midweek on champions league if if if the likes of foden and Rod start and look good and OD guard's definitely out i' back I just back City to do the job a lot better than what we did the job today and I'm like I don't know I don't know it's as ridiculous an idea as as as it sounds a way it is it is at the Emirates so it's is at the Emirates right I think yeah yeah in in a way like I'm like well that should mean hopefully that we have more of a kind of dingdong game on it um but yeah it's it's very it's very very difficult to not say You're going to Captain uh Captain Salah next week but I wouldn't be surprised if he still over 100% owned Holland next week yeah I think I think Bournemouth have shown themselves to be Man City okay it's at Man City it's at Man City yeah okay well then maybe then yeah then then yeah that just goes up a level with last game of the game week all that business all that stuff I don't know I'm I'm going to watch I'm going to watch the Champions League in midweek but I'm not as 100% on Salah as I would have been before this game started yeah but is that because like if Salah if Salah scores two goals against Forest is that different conversation if he was any good at Forest it's a yeah that's that's also fair but he's been he's been very good at he's been very good in all the other three games so well he's got the turns in all the other three games yeah but that's that's what we pay for well that's what you play for for some players you know it's it's for Holland there there to do but uh he did have some work to do um in the Liverpool one so let's let's go Liverpool because there's not really well the only other things you can talk about with city is the fact that Lewis played inverted left back and it is interesting because obviously we get a leak don't we that Lewis is starting there was a leak that that Lewis was starting all sounds fantastic yeah but the people that knew he was starting I bet they probably also play his left back and if they told us he was playing left back I don't know if I was a late person that brought him in and then found out and did on a leag well you're working on a league you can't you can't complain too much but um that's not good that's not good if you knew that Walker was also starting you would be like oh I don't like that um and then the great thing I thought for city was that when you've got Walker progressing down the right and you've got greish progressing down the left party all basically just went number 10 again did whatever he liked if if Walker and Walker and Gish start playing then then vard's insane like he he he could have he could have done a lot and saino gets five shots should P attention Sino is not not expensive five shots is nothing to sniff at um but yeah Holland it's just the thing with Holland is that you remember the like ton re thing used to say that if he had a if he had a right foot he'd score 100 goals it was in that thing he did a quote where he to him and it was after a Champions League game he said if you had a right foot you'd score 100 goals well what he's done is instead of crying at getting a right foot what he's done is learned to inside of his boot dig off the left foot which is exactly the same as hitting the ball off the right foot that's what he now does said so so previously if he had it he'd always slot it bottom left because he only had left foot and that or he' try and go around the keeper left left left side now he effectively doesn't have to open his body so it's less telegraphed he just uses that little inside dink off his left foot he's not got double the ways of scoring and it's that extra it's that extra touch as well I don't know whether you see just before the goal go just before he takes the shot it's the extra touch as well he's moving it that's that's effectively his way of moving under his right foot is moving it into the position to do the to the left foot dink yeah and then as soon as as soon as one keeper works that out it'll start switching it up it just start switching it up it just start switching it up cuz you're like how does he keep dinking this in the same places cuz like everyone cuz he's still hitting it his left foot yeah it's less telegraphed it's smart as hell he is smart as hell people underestimate how smart he is like or but when you hear him you kind of know he is smart but yeah mean everything about everything everything about that goal was was clever right just a little just a little bump on the back and made it look like he was run into and gives him that extra bit of space yeah everything about it was class I thought we said Callum Hudson Ando couldn't continue this goal like like this exact this exact goal like how how how much would you bet that he like you cele I mean you probably didn't celebrate it because you got a double all defense but but I celebrated it because of the fact of the goal like like like goes in I was like I I was watching it on this on this TV in front of me and I was just like yep that's exactly how I expected H to score this the only way he knows how it's literally the only way he knows and Keepers just have absolutely zero chance noo is just Nuno he done so well with this he's done so well with this like like give give the man some credit with this because this is on this is on Nuno and on on on slot this game you know in terms of what he he's done here um it's interesting that slot in his I thought his press conference afterwards he's like yeah yeah yeah that he actually said something like um something like we were let down by some individual performances but you'll only ever hear me talk about the team and I was like jell Quanza is not quite like it's an interesting one that he said we were let down by some individual performances didn't didn't name them because he said you so I'm not going to tell you they are um but some people he didn't like um for for how they performed but to take if you continually make ridiculously early Subs just because you haven't scored yet like the game's not over in 60 minutes it's not over like they're literally the momentum of this graphic says it's all going nicely it's all going nicely and then and Forest are doing absolutely nothing they're doing nothing yeah you make free all subs I feel like I'm old man but I don't know the remember of times this this this weekend I saw people managers doing three Subs at once when they weren't even winning by one goal or weren't even winning you're like or or like was it in one game I'm like who does three Subs at once feel like Pep's conditioned us now that don't do that like pep never does it does he you know is is he's he's even smart enough pep that if he needs to make like he made a double sub on Saturday he does it at half time because he's got 15 minutes to break the shape into what he's going to do he wouldn't do it like if you're going to do the changes just do them half time um but you do them 15 minutes into the half and it's like well now we've all got to try and get up to speed and change all this stuff but you've also shown your hand and Nuno goes oh Trent's gone is he they've they've you know taken off mallister have they oh they're bit bit open on the left side of Center Midfield or we could swing that all over suddenly a a little bit more open and I'll get what we'll do is we'll put hon ad do over there and he'll score his goal and he does exactly that like it's it's it's it's brilliant management but it's also slightly naive from Liverpool an extent because um it's not like they were cutting Forest open already you know if you weren't happy with it just do it half time yeah I mean at the same time I mean they could have they could have been a couple up early on as well um L Diaz obviously hits the post and does it the post but it is a 0.1 XG chance 0.1 is all right 0.1 is not a lot not when you're at home the the only only the only chance above that that sort of 0.1 is jotter that that's the Miss J's Miss that's the only one that gets to like quarter of an XG like don't forget this is not the scale it doesn't get one like you you can't with their their attack do it but it's because they enabled them to sit in you know we were looking at the past MCH before before um we started just for this game and it was something that um it it I mean it stings because we're Tottenham fans so we see this all the time um there is tottenham's one yeah but we Liverpool's one um so the past map here for the people are watching effectively you've got this basket um and then you've got this like sit on his own which is J so J's never being J's never passing what this means to um and he's not really being passed to either he's just standing as number nine he's in the way um but effectively Trent is really really close to Mo on the right hand side these are the past maps for the first 60 minutes so before the substitutions um but soas Li I thought so that was one of the worst games I've seen so had um Liverpool in this in that he he never tried to progress it centrally they were never trying to play you know into and out of jotter or they were never you know maybe he was let down by some poort decisions on on the guys outside him but Diaz and Mo just stayed very very wide and then they they couldn't cut inside so they just they sat in really really well Forest I thought they were really solid this is a team as as well by the way they've lost both their sixes effectively you know lost the gone the first first week of the Season then tangaro was out so lost both their defensive midfielders gone to anfield and and sat in and they did they they didn't have enough Artistry um I mean if anything it missed Harvey Elliott he is he has got something out in Harvey Elliott that does manage to unlock these things there was a lack of magic in the middle um he tried to address it by putting Trent effectively which is interesting that Trent stayed on and then Trent not only stays on but effectively Trent went to L number 10 I mean that should be good it should be good I mean conversely it kills off any it kills off any Baseline he's got and and this positioning as well because he's so close to Mo he's not actually be he's not actually able to you know really get those key he only had one key pass I think yesterday U and he's BAS where's he going to get it to exactly there's no one there's no one to pass to cuz he's ahead of soas and soas is as you say he's he had a poor game yesterday J's not really doing enough and again so Baseline of five yesterday which you know if he's sitting if he's sitting where jotter is feels okay because you know he's going to be he'll be getting you points through assists and goals and stuff but if he's not getting those nice then it doesn't feel it doesn't feel good well what I felt when I was watching liol last yesterday was was there was loads of really good everything's hit with really good technique you know what I mean like Trent crosses were like every single one they look so impressive but they never connecting because it's just not enough in there to connect them with um yeah it's is is this why are we seeing this as a as why klopp maybe favor J for for long periods because there just isn't that Wonder real Target I do wonder if GPO was there or Darwin like either or just someone with maybe another 12 inches on the height I think I think it's why Darwin looks even more lost when Darwin comes on like Round the Clock when Darwin came on he always looked like he was going to score four goals he missed the ball but he always looked like it was going to score four goals now when he comes on it doesn't even get the chances you sort of see you sort of see his face like his sad face in replays there'll be like a replay from behind the goal and they just be standing there looking sad um you know almost getting a rebound or doing stuff but like it's not like you couldn't keep Darwin quiet could you no he was always just a a hassle yeah teams teams are sitting in a good good way for them look Lots ball games in he don't have to respond to it but he needs more from so soide needs to be a big leader for that team in the number 10 position um and he's completely relying on him for minutes now because because Elliott's out I think if Elliott was fit he talked about Elliot quite a lot in his press conference on Friday and kind of thinking I know why now is is that when it's not working too well he's a game changer um yeah you still it's still a good game though is it still home to Bourn it's a good game orbe it Bourn Chelsea should we go for yeah I was going to say let's just let's just let's just go there let's just crack on I mean I mean if we whe there any good on their road and it they are they're a strong team at home small stadium syndrome yeah it's their own own own place they are they are good I mean first half they could have just absolutely blown him away yeah and then obviously they should be they should be in the lead with the penalty but who knows how do you feel about the uh about sending off we talk about one earlier but I don't know that that is double jeopardy that for for um Sanchez that I didn't feel like to play at all the isn't the rule isn't the law about making an attempt at the ball of which he made none no he took the player out no he just took the player out so it should just be a red card should just be a red card so so the reason they didn't it was the referee said that he made aemp play the ball yeah which he didn't Sur VAR can can clarify that literally watches it it's a very difficult it's a very difficult thing to say that he didn't play for the ball I don't know I think I think you can if the ref says I don't think he made a play for the ball and the V says well it looks like he doesn't actually make a play for the ball come and have a look let let us know like at least just look at it it's the panto thing like they only go over if they're going to change it etc etc but no just have another look do you think CU it's because it is a subjective interpretation right it's up to the referee the referee looks at again and goes n still think he was making a play for the ball okay yellow card move on he's there he sa a pen good save good save it it actually looked really hard to beat him yeah don't know if it's the orange kit or he's so tall but before he even took it you were like this does doesn't look easy to easy to save and then and then the save it looks like he fills the whole goal yeah um I and then Inu scores and then Inu no no I mean can't do it can no cu no because Chelsea looked a bit better when Sancho comes on I mean how how much can we trust that I think I think the thing with Chelsea is or just in this is like people say like you know you can't buy class and stuff but in football you can if you buy enough if you buy enough players if that other team doesn't score you just keep chucking them on till they do like Sancho comes on and he's better than the other one and K Jackson Jackson actually was a handful for him like he was the only one that was really causing any trouble for them but you know he always brings the XG he just misses them um and but you bringing kungu on bring a 78 million pound Striker on and at some point someone will score um the worry is obviously Palmer for this is that zero shots one chance created for 0.03 XA um is this like we said it about this keep saying it what is mesco ball like what is it what what are we looking into because we heard the old warnings from Leicester that it could be a bit dull is this is this the doll yeah it's a difficult one because the fixtures say we were looking at what we looking when I was looking at Wild Card I was looking at Jackson as an option and I kind of coed on it from a double up because I didn't feel the fixes were as good as they as they seemed so Bournemouth away West Ham away and then Brighton at home those three before making a move I didn't feel like those three were as good as you know fix your tickets fix your tickets making the are green for those four Bournemouth away for Bournemouth away West Ham away Brighton at home and Forest at home now and Forest stalkers going up yeah maybe they're not as good as that but you believe in Palmer you believe in pal we' seen nothing to say not see it but you see this and you're like well not involved yeah not involved today next day he's got half an XA and three assists right so it's it's still assists are noisy do you know what I mean assists are noisy they are I do want to see him score goals yeah I I don't often want to see Chelsea score goals but you want to see palas like like you expect to see Palmer score goals I mean pal shoot yeah and if he's going to play if he's going to play in that like little 10 spot then you know he should have opportunity to shoot I mean you know we always used to speak about kdb right we used to speak about kdb and whether we should have him as a do we want him as a goal scoring asset or do we have him as as like an assist asset who gets the bonus all that sort of stuff he's he's in that sort of he's in that kind of uh kind of level for me where you know most of his shots are going to be taken from around and outside the box and that means that you know he is going to have a lot of low extry chances that's just the way it's going to be but I mean but he's good enough that you be fine he's got that but similarly I mean again again looking at if you look at those passing those pass Maps I mean it's only really the first half he's very very tight m is it Mada and him just yeah but there there's literally no one in the middle like there there is no Center there is no Central but it is it'sit it's we are starting to see that now so it's a split pair so it's so it's right and right sided two right sided guys very that side and two left sided guys that side and yeah they're not occupying a lot of middle space yeah um yeah I don't know I don't I don't know um it's a hard week is it it's so hard to make any judgments from it because it is post International break and everyone has been crappy yeah I think he not like oh my God look at this guy um I think anybody who's sitting on Palmer though is very likely either while carding in game week six or if they don't have sacka already they're looking at a path down a sacker for game week six anyway so I think it's just a case of yeah you know having for the West Ham game and then let him go yeah I think it's pretty pretty I don't anyone's looking now at like longer term kind of things no but I think there's a lot of people that are thinking you know so I've been thinking if World card six is that I'd have no Salah and I have Palmer and um Palmer and Saca okay instead of Salah um and you look at this and you're like I thought I thought Salah was poor in in the game I thought he made some terrible decisions and and shooting we didn't need shoot and sorts of stuff still rather have more than Palmer right now and I think he's worth the extra couple of million on Palmer right now um yeah do I think ws and Palace away in six and seven is better for Salah than it is for Palmer home to B to Forest maybe do I think the fixtur is after that are better for Liverpool yeah yeah they are yeah um but maybe instead of either of those you go go a bit bigger up top and you just get Mr Watkins in that was smooth I like that I do like that just get Mr Watkins in because because he was always this was he wasn't just going to continue not to score goals was he the team is still do you know what you know I was like to make a couple of notes down about certain games and and the name the thing I wrote down on Villa is it's still all about ol it's still all about olle and and and interestingly Emory said after the game he was like I'm so I was so pleased my Striker and he was talking about Duran and I when he said it I was I just it was almost like he didn't even acknowledge the fact that Watkins originally just banged a brace in um expectation but yeah when when the notification come it's like two things you expect when this notification comes in for Villa goals it's one is it's probably Watkins and two is it's probably not Rogers yeah yeah there's various we a lot of us have got Rogers and not many of us have got that was a decision that was a decision that I made late on on Wild Card which is a bit um which is a bit frustrating and shout out to shout out to meds who's in the chat meds does our thumbnails he's a villa fan um yeah so shout out to him for this wonderful thumbnail that we had today with all of the terrible points on on there um yeah I mean the the second goal in particular like just his awareness to be in that be in that position ahead I mean it's it's like it's Michael Keane so okay but ahead of him there just to slot the ball away is just elite elite forward Play That's that that's all it is yeah um six shots mate it's six shots he's over one XG oh man definitely definitely should have been walking away definitely should have been walking away with hatrick it's same exactly the same what in Holland there it's it's literally like here you go six shots everyone XG you're going to be all right you're putting yourself in the chance to get yourself a hattick yeah and you know didn't didn't get it this is slightly this is a different world to the Bournemouth one where Everton like because Everton after 15 minutes that first 15 minutes they should have been free0 down in 15 minutes it was they would they couldn't get out and then luckily they've got well class D manil yeah I think he's good when he can get into if he can get in I me obviously he gets the assist he gets the assist for calv L as well but you know so he's on set pieces if he can get in between midfielders and Defenders he can cause trouble like he's he's very good at causing trouble how often that actually happens I don't know the fixtures are really really good though he'd back him to score more points than than Rogers wouldn't you oh absolutely pedigree more than anything if you had the chance to go again right now with Lester away Palace at home Newcastle at home it switch away Fulham at home Southampton away West Ham home said you can have Rogers on mcneel who you have him yeah i' probably go McNeil but then that would give me Watkins right so I just do that do it that way around and that's and that's kind of where I was in terms of like having Mina or having Watkins but just didn't yeah I was just scared of not having Bruno which is stupid but on that last game mention but you know SEO had had nothing we love him but he had he had nothing no chances and and he was covering right back a lot like he was covering down that you know um yeah he was doing lots of good work lots of tracking but tavanir and Evan nson were having the fun up the top and cver for example there only so many so many attackers they can possibly have at one time on it but um but Neil on all set of pieces I mean the P we joked about it with Andy but but he is an option at 5.5 m we joked about Luca de as well I mentioned it I mentioned LC de yeah we yeah we shut you down a lot quicker on very quickly on LCA de and then gets another assist um but like with with Rogers I feel like he goes away I think he's got like the how how can I put it it's almost like a Jud Bellingham film feel about him whereby he's he's this big fish in a small pond in the England under 19s or whatever and he looks like he's the absolute Daddy and everything runs through him and he controls what goes on and so the performances and the output match the expectation from him here 's the big guy so he's always looking to try and put it on the plate for him and he's he's always trying to like help Ole make things work for olle which is why I feel like some of those passes that he makes into him you know when they're just out of reach and like Watkins is absolutely fuming you it is those centimeters that make a difference there was um there was just before um the manil goal there was there was a bit where there was Watkins took a tough shot and if he just let the ball run it goes to Rogers and he and rers tried to moan at him Watkins is like whatever mate this is my thing whatever um yeah yeah um I don't think I'm ever going to stop coughing by the way Jesus no starts starts at some point they'll play Watkins and Jan together that's the worry I'm at some point it's coming in it yeah at some point it's coming I mean he's he's going to demand he's going to demand minutes like he almost he almost um topped the goal that he scored did you see that yeah he almost TOS it with the Bic B he's just a banger and it's not like he he's he has a go at these things all the time yeah yeah loves it yeah he's really good really good is c a cheap is C lein a cheap option though well Cal Le is is an interesting one for me because next week Everton are away to Leicester and so if everything goes okay and any second y OFA starting we have some kind of indication that they'll be starting then I suspect that munis doesn't start and I then have to make a decision on transferring him to another Striker and the options are Joe Pedro so we're going to talk about all these in the next couple of games Joe Pedro Jamie vardy or Cav and Cav and vardy you gotone well off Eddie and KY already yeah not next week not for a one week pun okay oh for one go home to man united it's one week one week and out okay it's one straight game you're use use a transfer on a onewe punt given that you can carry transfers over what and then oh is not playing they're fine yeah fine yeah of course yeah yeah got no choice yeah have to one week pun there's not there's not there's not you know mo has lost his place mate like that's that's a problem um and so and it's not a good game anyway Hunter Newcastle no I agreed so yes you have to use it Cal Len looks all right he'll be on pens as well won't he so be on pens yeah but we've also seen him get taken off because he's not been all right yeah that's that's that's the issue so let's do the next let's do the next guy which is Jamie vardy before we do Jamie vardy um D has just mentioned that we' we've been on for about an hour which is cool and there's now over 500 people watching so if you are watching hello and um if you want to hit the like button that would be absolutely fantastic there's like 150 likes which means 350 of you are not doing your job properly um and also please if you want to see more from us make sure you hit the Subscribe button and we would be truly truly grateful as we move to Palace versus Lester there he iser there is the man there is the big man I mean he's now a much bigger man than he was before this game like mata's very interesting very interesting all of a sudden um because T penalty yeah and I think there's some people that saying that how did we not know that Mata was going to take penalties or not be involved in the conversation I don't think I don't think there was ever a conversation about whether he'd take a penalty I think we all just assumed that every time that e was on the pitch e took all the penalties so Mata took penalties last year but only when a was injured I think I understand it right yeah but Mata took penalties in the summer fine that makes again makes perfect sense it took penal the summer um it's in France and I think we talked about this I think we we to talk about this actually on a pot I can't remember which part it was I think end of season or something it must have been maybe with Harry or something I don't know but we definitely talked about some point about how good he was at penalties like he he takes him like Tony doesn't he he takes him it's got that sort of big dog energy about him the way that he does it you know what I mean is is of he's never missing so as soon as he's taken one you're like well that's that's it now for life like bumo is really good at penalties but Tony's Tony so he took him forever and that's how I feel like this is E's like boom he's he's good at penalties but number nine thanks very much takes a penalty you're never seeing that ball again yeah it's it's when I it's when it's when glasner after the game says well they're both penalty takers and I let them decide on the pitch I'm like if I'm look at him I'm not I'm not standing I'm not I'm not standing up to Mata saying can I can I have this one please Jean fle mate you number nine mate was anyone ever getting the ball off you no chance Z chance like zero chance see Zero chance I to you and sayam can I have that no no like even if even if I'd missed a penalty it was like no no absolutely not Absolut because I have to score the next one that's kind of how it works yeah um so he is suddenly you know a marvelous Ops Well Done For Those there's quite a few people that went early because of the fixtures and this player in particular who I'm sure didn't get him in assuming he was going to be on penalties but there you go yeah um and I mean just staying with it the first goal that's not off side is it that's not that is off side sorry that is offside they just messed it up I just I just don't know I don't know because you looked at it and you're like that's offside and then they drew the lines and you could still see the head the other side of it and you're like that's still offside like it's even the most unlucky thing in the world that the man blocking The Cross by him trying to stop a cross has ended uping goal cuz my assumption is my assumption is is the line that's on the line that's on the sort of the Down the Line image is exact is is tagged as exactly the same line as is on the out the sort of the further away image I'm assuming it's designed that way so they both so you don't move the line you put it down once and then the image just the AI will just say this is this and this is this it's on the same photo Etc which I which for me I would trust I would like to be like okay cool that's that's how it works but it never it never actually looks on side like in any in any of the photos and and you know they little La arrows which I think the TV put maybe put on I'm not sure even sure if they put them on but the arrow came from the guy's leg but it didn't come from mata's head and it's definitely mata's head that where he is I'm like I I I think it's not helped by the camera screen sort of paned to madly in the Ving and as soon as it paned across to him I got like um like ant and deck Vibes yeah mean just give the go just give the go mate I I don't believe this I don't believe this um so there's that I mean vardy vard has one shot one goal can we talk about how he's absolutely rinsed gayy as well like at 37 years old he's like rinse like literally rinses him and played 90 minutes again it's mad it is mad Red Bulls are fun they didn't do much cuz they didn't score they didn't they didn't score or to get any chances but but the round the KE bar you don't see anyone go around the keeper anymore like it's just so rare um it was it was good um well you saw try to do it in the game before didn't you yeah K is just yes K just Nicks it off his toe oh God yeah yeah God as for Palace um I don't understand this fre the back I just don't get it I I can just I feel like everywhere I'm roll out and say why are you doing this but you really good before the back You' decided to go free at the back if you're going to go free at the back what you need is a central playmaker a really good playmaking Defender and they had that his name was [ __ ] Anderson you need somebody that can can pass you know through the lines do the extra stuff now I think laqua can do that a bit but this league is Harsh he was ripped apart you know is is is for both their goals I thought he was slightly a fault for him um I I just don't know why he's still playing this it doesn't it doesn't make sense to me um and then it just hurts everyone they're so limited the places in which they can get the ball to anyone like and's had loads of shots six shots in the end or something like that and six shots yeah six shots but partially that's you know helped by the fact that they were two-nil down yeah 3xg but six shots yeah but he's he's he's getting more shots than this because they were they were behind it so up until that point he was covering mostly you know most of the time he's sitting her right back you know is is is um yeah I don't it's it's a hard one it's a hard one but yeah I I definitely think there's nothing wrong with intio 5.9 it's looks looks good he's playing it looked like the IOU role and IU used to be relatively productive at relatively cheap ones and he's better than IOU so you'd expect him to score more points tonight um but yeah it feels I mean just in terms of I mean just in terms of I don't I don't feel like like any of the fixes coming up feel good for you know doubling up on Palace assets no next week Everton yeah okay and then who's that after that Liverpool no you know as as a still their best player he still had still had free shots he's still had fre chances created he's still the for of the team but if he's not in pens that's that's a hit and then if they've got two playing Strikers that's a hit on his bonus yeah so he's now got some bigger issues plus they're playing Five Defenders so if they do over clean which they don't but if they did that's not a good remover no so there's there's a lot of things where it's like well e would be you know guarant he going to get all the points and stuff to suddenly I'm like not so sure he guaranteed to get all the points um yeah that happens that happens in games where I guess I guess you just you still just trust that at some point he will get physical returns rather than the bonus element I know it's bad on his bonus but if he scores and Mata doesn't then it's obviously fine but the likelihood I think of I think Mata holds a very maybe not quite a Harland esque type position in this side yeah very much like a Tony kind of position but in in the sense that you feel like when Palace scor twice he'll get one right you don't you feel like it'd be unusual for Palace to score twice and Mata not to be involved in that conversation I can't say that yeah exactly I can't say that I can't say that I just so it's maybe about more about picking like if you if you haven't got to e yet and you are thinking of a palace asset I think Mata is probably a really good option and then you play is a genuine conversation in terms of a striker with I still think we need to see more for I think San's sample size is so small that we can't really make anything of it because he's played tet over Nicholas Jackson now though yeah yeah I think I'd go there Nicholas Jackson yeah but you still need to be able to you still need a yeah but you would replace him elsewhere and you'd upgrade so you wouldn't have to play mateta every week I still wouldn't play mateta every week if I had the option to I don't about that yeah you going to take a million and a half you're just going to stick it in your pocket you'll stick it you'll stick it somewhere where it matters yeah that's the thing yeah yeah yeah he could he just could be I mean he likes hauling he likes hauling I've still never had one of his halls but he likes hauling yeah um midv Playmakers let's go to your other one it did give you a return let's go to Bruno Bruno man be um you were golfing during this Wen I was golfing during this I didn't watch this game so you tell me well what what I said is I'm sure you watch like highlights and stuff like that but with it but what you never pick up from highlights that you will from watching Bruno is that last 20 minutes and certainly when I said last 20 minutes I mean last 15 minutes of regular time and then the six or 7 minutes it was injury time God he was so close to scoring so many times it's just it just has that in him where last 15 minutes we're winning here I'm I'm going to be on this um and yeah I was amazed it was gacho the snatching in the death because even right to the end like he just gets further further further further further forward last man waiting for it making the right runs he was so he was deep deep during that first half they really struggled in general and he was back in Midfield and he was doing the stuff but that last 15 minutes he still was like I'm going to score here and if he scores and he gets you know already got the assist to gets a bonus with it yeah you'd have had double digit um yeah if you ask me is is he worth like a million and a half more than eay before this weekend would I have said that no coming out this weekend would I say that yeah yeah I think I don't think he's a problem in your team at all Bruno um he he could comfortably have dou this this this game um he obviously just gets booked instead because that's how he is that's how he is he's just constantly moaning and then kicks the ball um um but yeah I mean they're getting some clean sheets they they were I know they've had a couple of good chances in that first half um but up until the penalty it was just a matter of time before s scored it was just a matter of time um dibling the right winger 4.5 was incredible um but it's because Dow is a left back who's not left back yeah um and then everything just goes flat from the penalty how comes how comes BBD just doesn't take the penalty I just don't I just couldn't fathom it he was being because AR because Archer did really well in training doesn't make any sense [ __ ] what [ __ ] reason that is as well I just don't get it you're like and he was doing all the stuff you know what I mean he was getting people injured he was hurting people annoying people he was winding them all up it he just assumed it and I tell you what if Diaz had taken that penalty and scored it at that point we've talked about some five and a half Midfield was 12 m0 for example but Diaz would be on everyone's radar yeah um very interesting that um so on a sampton point that obviously Armstrong Armstrong would would have taken the the penalty was on the pitch but wasn't on the pitch but then also didn't come on whilst losing they brought on Ross Stewart 4.5 Striker yeah who's massive um I almost felt like he didn't bring Armstrong on because they' missed the penalty I bet he lost his [ __ ] at half time I bet Armstrong lost his [ __ ] at half time because it makes you look so stupid didn't it you've dropped your penalty Taker and then you missed the penalty yeah you wouldn't taken that well sort about how you'd form as number nine mate you wouldn't have taken that well if you dropped and then replac him and miss the penalty I uh missed a penalty and then was taken off about 15 minutes later once that was first half incredible how did you say that uh I wasn't having a good game so it's fine I was actually just a terrible game so it's fine but uh yeah no I'm fine Bruno's good I'm fine with Bruno at the moment I think he's still definitely a book transfer you know the whisle thing does change G to be the pick I want gacho to be the pick though like gacho should be a pick and he's actually getting points but he's not playing and I'm not sure what they're going to do there because obviously rashford scores Ahad was great Ahad created six chances and he's very different to the other two like he is good creatively there's a lot of sacker in the way that he plays and that he's quite efficient you know what I mean like he's passing rates are fantastic like made over 50 passes in the game at like 90% completion like he's he's a very efficient guy I don't see them wanting to pull him out of Team xery doesn't look like he wants to score that's an issue but that might change if he scores a you I don't know I don't know uh I think Bruno is still the only pick for me um I still wouldn't go anywhere near the defense I know they've scored other points in this one but I didn't I didn't fancy they were keeping that clean until the P Miss and then soton part yeah and this is the surprising as well because this this is the plum fixture for them they do their fixtures are still okay for the next few weeks in fact for quite a while but they're okay they're just okay right yeah and if they're okay you want the Talisman and the Talisman is still burer yeah plays every minute and it gets better as the game gets on yeah agreed um we got left uh Brighton Fulham and wolves Newcastle where you want to go got wolv go today wolves Newcastle um I was quite happy when uh when my wife sent me a message about half hour into the game she was like Adam can you come and sort out the potato for dinner yeah perfect went downstairs missed the goal perfect perfect timing I was bored though like this first half was boring yeah it was boring it just didn't it was boring didn't take very it was nice I thought it was nice but you know what I mean we just we we just we' just been huffing and puffing at Arsenal it was like anything was going to be nice yeah yeah it was nice well we got used to nice without a lot of goals um but I thought w play I thought wolves played some really good football I was I was impressed you know every time I see wolves I'm really impressed with the the commitment to play good football it's quick it's intricate I like what I see I think K is just a baller um made some terrible decisions though didn't he he made a couple of really terrible decisions around in the box and if I'm looking at you know we we'll talk about it probably in about four or five weeks time as we come to like game week 11 um but all I I need the striker not to make those stupid decisions when you got a good fix to run yeah he's going to be cheap though he's a hard one to read he he he's he's he reminds me a lot of again Tony type player where it's a guy of oh I want him in the box and he's hanging out somewhere on the left just having a laugh or decided to just drop deep for a little bit and then suddenly he'll just try a bicycle kick somewhere and do some stupid stuff like like he's cool to watch but yeah he'd frustrate you as well I'm sure um which is why I think they're plan a striker with him yeah it allows him to have a bit more freedom to to do stuff but it still feels like he's the he's the big dog for them um Newcastle let made mistakes is obviously he said it comes off half time with look like it was a bloody nose how said actually it was more his eye but you know reporter said they couldn't stop it bleeding and I'm like what is I don't know that's not great doesn't sound ideal does it no but um yeah have to hope for the best that he's okay if he's not okay I don't know hell what I do I have no idea what I do with this team um and um but Gordon was the best thing by then by miles in that first half he had some Adar toast you know he I've just quoted the I think the commentator used at the time I was going to say I remember hearing those words those exact words I just just Tak them out of my mouth but he literally did like he obviously hits the post um which again won't be a very high XG chance that be the one about 18 20 minutes in um but he was everything good was go to him and try and make it happen um there is an ongoing thing with isach that it just doesn't stay as number nine does he he wants to co again similar just doesn't want to stay in the Box um and when he doesn't you're like well who else is going to be in the Box um but luckily they got out of it because they got some players and score bangers I I would push I mean I didn't I didn't tweet when Sher scored because you know when it comes off a defender's head I don't I don't really want to call it a banger if the if the defender heads it over the keeper I'm not I'm not claiming it I'm not I'm not claiming it as a banger it doesn't count I mean it counts but it doesn't count it's not a banger shanga and share call it wherever you want Johnson just basically just PLU plucks that if it doesn't hit Dawson's head so I'm not having it as a banger barns Banger Banger no Banger stop stop Trying no no no no it's too late for that [ __ ] mate and then obviously they get all the XG the last couple of minutes but no one cares yeah yeah no one cares about that so no cares about that but I was sitting there and Gordon Gordon has to play false again this is like double if Isa can't play and Gordon plays false n well that's just an absolute disaster because when he's there he just looked miserable he was so miserable I don't know where it's just you know just it's General to be though but he look like can't be asked even that the one of the big chances at the end tali's one yeah like he was on the whole time Barnes has got the ball and he's on the whole time you're like just give it to him but it's Barn so he's head down he's just running Ain doing stuff and then he finally looks up and he goes I pass to you and and Gordon just waiting for that ball to just come to him and tala just nips in and says I'll have that I'll have that and I'll have a shoot and I'll miss it um and Gordon uh just wedgied wedgied himself just after that he I was going to pull my shorts up and hurt myself and I was like yeah we all know that feeling this weekend mate yeah yeah um yeah it's um it's not good for it's it's it's not good but they're getting results they are grinding results Newcastle so you'd be happy if if you're them um and the fixtures are still okay they're not good enough that you want to get that players in though no but You' be got I think I was wild card in I moved on no but if I was wild card and I'd gone no Harland I think I'd have had esack or Watkins and I think would have kept E I don't think I would have done that I mean I know I just my wild card because obviously I was I was on Watkins over isack yeah because Watkins is Watkin and I had a draft I money I had the money for either but I've got a feel I might have Push sh kept eack P him away I mean you obviously got the Wolves Away so but now you full him away City at home Everton away not ideal yeah Brighton Chelsea Arsenal no yeah no I'll take the Wolves home ipswitch away please all right let's go the last game no it last game we still haven't done full and West Ham yet what do you want to talk about here oh full and West Ham Jim gets in in scores that's it is it is it sour grapes that I own Anthony Robinson that I want VAR to have ch the go off because of the throw in being in the wrong position yeah definitely definitely cuz that's pathetic because what I'd like to know is if they decided they were going to do that what's the tolerance what's the tolerance because because they took the throw in from like 25 yards further than when it went out out that's quite that's quite some distance that is a lot quite some distance like and it and so they took it quick the ball gone out diagonal run after and then so it goes out diagonally and then they run back in diagonally so they thir down by time it comes full triangle yeah yeah yeah the further down take it one touch into Wings go straight in the goal so it's literally one one one and they all straight away I think I think um silver got book in of course he does um for it and I'm like what what would it take for V to go oh by the way that wasn't the right place and could they I don't know I don't think it's a situation they they've kind of thought of no I've never thought I've never thought the thing for it but but it is it is like you never see a foul throw right like there's no foul throws don't exist in the professional game they literally don't doesn't matter how you throw it in the ref just like n just carry on who cares can't even remember who it was I saw this weekend but someone kept F thr and I was like why is no one picking this up um cuz cuz when you used to play it used to be a thing but when you're a professional like everyone no no one wants to see 20 foul throws given every game that's not entertainment get the ball on theit no the first one is the the first F throw It's Entertainment if you're there yeah yeah yeah the abuse um but yeah I was it's just so irritating last kick of the game um luckily he wasn't in the Bon if he was in the bonus oh God i' have been fuming he was he just outside would he he was two outside yeah yeah he was outside so but Newcastle Newcastle and city in the next three for Fulham it feels like benching opportunity and they got to go to Forest as well one thing though on that right refs let's finish with a little moment at refs as as we're getting there at the end okay one is you give Anthony Taylor an 8:00 game on a Saturday night you give him Prime Time viewing and he does four te bookings that that was funny you know like literally you imagine how happy had gone to bed 14 bookings record a record then then you go to our game so it follows 14 bookings plus a game where there was a bit of controversy that they took the throw on in the wrong place now think the next game which was a 2:00 game for us on the Telly how many times did they send Arsenal back for taking the throw in the wrong place yeah loads they did it literally a times just go back it was like oh so it's like an admission of Gil and then Jared Gill goes you know what I'm going to do anony and round up I might have been a bit AR last night gave 14 bookings um seven in the first half seven in the first half oh it's normal now ref did you hear the ref oh they're punishing they're punishing they're punishing anything nowadays I did enjoy I mean we're going completely off off of Full in West H but I did enjoy the fact that the first booking of the game was uh was celba kicking the ball away and not delaying the restart thought it was hilarious given given the dean rice situation yeah just just like just like that happened so we better back it up better back it up or better correct it overcorrect it so [ __ ] stupid um not much more the only thing I was like at again we're on these cheapos you can tell a man's about to go on wild card when they're looking at all all the way get cheapos for we all try to think of options that aren't aren't Morgan Rogers and not scoring but try oros everything we talk all the time about everything goes on the left everything goes on the left you got the little Trio of stuff but what it does mean is he got loads of space on the right and it ends up going to's always there no.6 always there because he has a big he has a big header isn't he one of these TS big Ts is a big header which I I mean again like Adat is not the kind of person that I'd ever think of heading the go heading the golf ball heading the football but yeah I think he's interesting he's interesting I think he's interesting because he's because he is just like chaos and he is chaos it's just so little games you'd play him you look at his next game you're like have him as your first sub every game yeah see there's nothing look at the pictures I'm just even looking to see if there's any like runs I mean there's no runs really nah you might even if even when you get like game week 19 there's like four games and it's like nope back into Man United at Newcastle you need him as first s and hope for the best yeah basically is he five five you need him as first five oh he's five five he's five fine I mean five that's that's cool yeah um right himz scores yeah himz has to start next game surely yeah MZ hasn't scored this season MZ hasn't scored himz has himz has himz starts himz scores yeah makes perfect sense you don't ever get leaks for full them do you so you're not going to get any leak on minutes no one cares no one really cares no no one really cares you know no one cares about those Strikers from all the other teams they just want to know about your about the uh 4.7 million city right left back most important thing yeah you're not getting Min leag yeah that's never happening so I think yeah I think if you've got miners you have to gamble this week I'm sure if Harry or Ross or any one of those boys wanted to find out about Fulham they could go and find out I'm sure they find out they're fir away there's any in the nose on Fulham hit me up hit me up found someone that was uh like in the know like Newcastle and I messaged him once he said he he said he'd uh he said he might have something this was back in the summer I messaged him once he gave me absolutely nothing didn't even respond and now all I see now all I see on X is him just abusing people I'm like a perfect this is what I need it wasn't will no no but no but he gives him [ __ ] which is fair no he doesn't um Brighton versus H switch and we're done and we're done and just to knowe I think this this is the third keeper that we've got a top bonus this week let's not do any5 do do the doesn't do our narra any good mate um about they don't they don't concede don't con it's in so Brighton have 70% possession they have 21 shots ever and ipswitch player low block MH so they play low block versus Liverpool and Man City you kind of expected that and you know all the sort of like stats make them look like they were a low block team but they weren't really a low block team at all in the championship but then they come out play low block um and they take all this in and I'm I'm a little worried that M that they're confused that they're confused that they've seen you know Burnley come up and Burnley very similar type of style play last se you know in the championship through the Premier League and then still went with the swash buckling type way and it didn't work and I think most of us expected it to be swash buckling they're going to give it everything and don't get wrong they had some chances um the obviously it's a post and Hinson had a chance at the end but most of the chances seem to be after they've run like 70 yards and people are tired yeah I mean your shots Never As Good after you run 70 yards um but yeah I think they need to work out what they're what they're going to do and how they're going to play these games now s Hampton's next week so you'd expect them when they play Southampton to play in the more custom style we were used to seeing them because hey they're it's two ex- championship teams you'd hope that that's what you saw but um but at the same time we're like five weeks in and he's been working on this particular setup with them you got to coach it back into coach it back into them for the Southampton game like how they played last year I don't know I mean obviously like the first tog yeah I mean but this is not this is not unusual for this is not unusual for Brighton like a Brighton that we're used to seeing versus a promoted side I would I'd expect this kind of sort of domination on in chances I would expect that especially no we haven't mentioned no J Pedro obviously in this as well you know about to go this is this is a paddling this is a paddling um uh I think the interesting pieces you've got Mata had three shots um two of which in the same ocean which obviously should have buried that's the big boy um and the second one for it um georgino had three shots wck had four shots BBA had four shots yeah um M had none yeah no shots whatsoever um uh and I think that is a little bit because of georgino think called geino Rooter is how they were saying routa uh um he's very different to Pedro Pedro obviously J Pedro he'll sit as the number 10 but he he wavers about he goes around and he and he presses high and he does whatever he wants really um whereas geino felt very right channel um alongside well Beck Mo it became more like a 42 um of a striker but that sort of like right side a bit like say like an old like Daniel sturd almost type things where he's not really a striker but he's also right winger he's like somewhere there which is not good for the right winger so it doesn't surprise me that M didn't get any any shots in because he was always in the position where the shots were going to be so he's taking you know the ball a bit further away from the penalty area not getting in so if I I wouldn't be overly panicked because you'd assume that Pedro comes back in georgino in the next game um which probably means it's better than for M again um but it was quite an alternative like like because it wasn't just oh I'll do this one versus this one I'm like what if occasionally he does want to play like a 442 they maybe you know maybe he does um maybe that isn't good for M maybe occasionally that isn't good for Pedro but um feel like Pedro is too important for him yeah I think you have to just assume that the M back in and didn't score and all that stuff uh Mar gets 11 pointer but you don't you don't it's all very well get them pointed but they did need 2xg don't really want don't really want to be having Keepers from teams that can see 2xg uh no any other takes I don't think so uh all all I'm just doing is show my age so triple Subs really bothered me also it switches collars that's going to be my last last point for the weekend see I don't even know about hold on got to have a look at how high I switches collars are but like the collar is like it's like there it's like there on the neck I'd hate that what am I looking at IP switch collar yeah you watch you watch Liam deap after he scores he looks like he's choking himself don't know what they're doing oh I don't know where I'm going I got to find this I don't want to go to the website that slowing right down now look your own time mate I got a picture of Amari here oh you mean what the fact that it's thick oh the blue the thick blue yes like right right up here or they I like it I mean that you don't not playing it you not playing in it wa it's not that far up his neck maybe maybe it sits sits differently on other people maybe I don't think is that the actual kit from Saturday yeah the dark one yeah yeah sits sits in like you watch watch Liam the lap it looks like he's got no I'll watch it back so high I'll watch it back I'll watch it back just for that just to look at the color that's that's the inside people are here for um yeah we've gone we've gone under 500 people now which means people know that we're about to finish which is fine um they know it's over they know it's over uh yeah hopefully you've had a I mean if you haven't had a better game week than me then I mean I don't know what you're doing it's it's quite impressive to be fair 23 points on a wild card literally the worst game we could SE easily done though is it I don't think it is that easy I feel like you don't have Holland it is what this soon take te I'll be down to 29 Points replace him with a one po 30 points then you take Gabrielle out I could be on yeah but we're s yeah yeah but we're sitting here we're sitting here in a position where all the premium assets have banged all the weeks so far like in in fact actually like a premium asset has matched Harland in every week so far G in the chat's got 22 shout out to you Gareth I re you you should send Gareth some coasters don't do this mate because if you say if you say this every every single person L 23 points is want Coter mate and I'm going to end up instead of only if they're in stream if you're in stream still and you've got less than 2 if someone sat through an hour and a half of us talking about this nonsense all right and they've got less than 23 points they should get some coasters so Gare get that's G send me a message on on X there you go and I'll send you some we want to pick though we want to see how bad it is we were supposed to give something away for a million views weren't we we do it tomorrow do it tomorrow on X yeah G's like over 10 million game R yeah we're I'm there mate don't worry we're there why don't we do we like to work this out the stream if you retweet your Tweet for this pod we'll leave that in the first 24 hours and then everybody after that and then you do a draw on those send someone a mug okay that's it and that's just for everyone here in in stream no no everyone yeah but we're not going to tell everyone to retweet yeah they won't know they exactly watching it so exactly so you have to know if you retweet which stream people will or people that make it this far in the video which would be impressive impressive I won't time stamp and say a giveaway say final thoughts I do the final final one is final thoughts but if you're in the no if if you time that one says giveaway you know you would we'd see in like the in the uh in the analytics you're like Spike maybe I should do that every week and then should do every week right um that's it we're done Baker always a pleasure mate thank to everyone in the chat mate you made it for the week we will be here again next week we have got uh Team selection coming Wednesday or Thursday we'll figure it out then and now I'm going to go and cough myself to sleep so L night mate [Music] m [Music] [Music],17879,n right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam and as always joined by baker hi mate how you doing that was not sincere no it wasnt at all wasnt at all it was you last week its me this week but a lot of people turn up here misery loves company mate misery loves company that is that is exactly right and theres already 120 people in here because everyone wants to hear about how fantastically we did this week and and our takes on the fact that tottenham failed to win the or even draw the north london derby and im struggling like my weekend has just been horrific like if you could describe a weekend like this is just like terrible my wife ended it with like the sun came out i was like well thats good thats positive but everything else was just crap just rubbish give us the wakad give us the wakad okay so i wake up yesterday morning with a bit of a cold and ive been struggling today sore throat everything i had my head in a bowl earlier with with vick trying to clear my nose and stuff just to make sure that i dont just to make sure that im all right tonight then i played golf yesterday as well so went out there tough track sorry is a tough its a tough track you showed me scores there before its aough tr tough track ive never broken 84 there so shot 90 wife told me to go out because the weather was going to be good and it rained i like this makes no sense all my fpl assets did absolutely nothing harand smashed it i expected him to do that anyway so thats fine and then north london derby so thats been my weekend just just a load of rubbish how was your weekend slightly better good slightly better slightly better hey my weeks my only reason i have a green arrow this morning is because is or this evening is because of the goal against tottenham from gab with my team and i was saying to i think i mentioned it in the chat just at the start that well in in the chat before we were setting up that i only realized you had gabrielle in your team when i was setting up the pod i hadnt had a look i didnt even take any didnt hadnt noticed that you had him in there so much so that i had to double check your team id to make sure that i got the right one i was like he doesnt have gabrielle surely i aint got a lot of choice mate well see my team in a minute but i was close i was close hitting him out for robo imagine because i had two weeks effectively before wild card and you were like does robo score four points more than he does in those two weeks and i was like probably but there was always the chance of what happened today there was always that chance and theres always a chance that the other part i started thinking about was what if rober doesnt made the second game what if rober plays this one then ched and all gabriel play and i was like ive got no bench and im just im just im just surviving just surviving week to week at the moment and i was just trying i was hoping i could just roll through next week ill be okay thats not happening im definitely making a transfer next week so it will be another transfer next week i dont want a wild card next week its a its we talked last week about this was a good week to wild card mhm it looked it next week does not look a good week to wild card at all in terms of swings of fixes ive got no issues with my team like the team itself ive got no issues whatsoever with it just got no returns no returns this week but when you look at it this weeks being so if you had a h in cap youre okay youre okay youre fine if you had harand and capsella its probably not you need something else you need you need a gabrielle you need a watkins you need a mateta other than that you need ry still in go because nobodys got not many people have got mich is 11 pointer that he gets or nanas or ors or sanchez what no ones got those so therefore no ones got dd eight points do what those things are not the things that are coming in so its just you needed something and if you had a couple of things you were okay if you had more than a couple of things you did amazing if you got esr off the bench i hate you the gabriel the gabriel the gabriel for sh pedros was just were just disgusting i saw them i saw i saw someone take isaach out to get pedro in so they could afford salah and then didnt have isack but and got and then also got gabri off the bench so they got salah cant even turn around thing is i cant even turn around now and say like wheres my luck because i had it in game week to some extent i definitely feel like in the start of the season that it is huge wings luck is huge wings and it feels it hurts more because any return is like monster drop or monster gain its its still big and what you will see is were already starting to see like were four weeks in and some people ive just ridden the wave like i was looking at it thinking feel like ive done all right im treading water right like if i want it to be top 10k its 55 more points to me now already 55 points four weeks i was in it in it i must be i must be i must be the only person that was in well probably not the only but the only like relatively ious manager that was in the top 10k after two weeks and then hes now outside the top two million but its not just like football and fpo its the same things in it certain small little things make such huge things weve seen it so southampton miss a penalty well man united like it was well talk about it just flat lines immediately is same with bournemouth couldnt couldnt have been doing more do that oops just the so many any little things they dont go your way you get hurt and thats why we turn up on sundays to talk about it indeed so i didnt tell you i had this but id half started putting it together and then i get a text from someone saying by the way mate if youd have if youd have done nothing if youd have done nothing youd have got 73 points i deliberately hadnt asked you i hadnt i hadnt i hadnt asked you this cu cuz weve had the conversation before had you done it and stuff like that and done the counting up and whats the point in that but this is the if i was hit by a bus i would be in the top 40k right now like theres rya gabrielle bruno smith row haren cap that would be it if id have been hit by a bus and you have four transfers next week and i have four transfers next week and my wild card come on then m but be nice to people this is what i keep saying it but like dont be a dick to say if you havent done that because were all gonna were all going to have to face this we all are this is some of the problem is we are all going to have to press that button and thats thats what got me the fear this week i was so close topress i talked about it quite a lot with our boy spaceman we talked we talked through wild card a lot hes got a relatively similar team orbe his looks a bit nicer than mine but a lack of liverpool same as me and i was pretty close pretty close to maybe pressing the button but it was i just kept thinking well maybe and its its tough but at some point ill press it and weve all been there before we pressed it in the first week of wild cards absolutely terrible hopefully if next week it bounces back because it looks so much better than non wild card teams next week or forgiven absolutely if it doesnt then ang angry so lets just go by lets start by saying

your score we need to let just lets just show the scores quickly shout your score out and we move on right showing the scores and reading out for people that are listening so i had 23 points on my wild card yay went down to about two 2m rank martinez picked him for the fixtures cheers got booked as well thanks trent won robinson one lewis one was all pretty happy when he the starting lineup wasnt too wasnt too fussed about that and then the halftime sub wasnt ideal rogers hes just points dodging like hes better at points dodging than bruno right now hes fantastic he to watch just does doesnt score any points salah captain four points did nothing e could have taken a penalty didnt take the penalty two points palmer three bruno with my only return of the game week which was an assist wow its the only return i had across the entire team and then intia who had six shots and still nothing and then salanki today that header as it crept past the post nightmare i pedro in there sank came in theres an auto sub i got johnson pedro parro and in fact my highest scoring player is leaf davis and he sits third on my bench wonderful thats weit mate thats for the ages for the ages well been four weeks mate and youve had one of the best weeks ive ever seen and one of the most painful weeks ive ever seen thats how thats how i played the game mate thats its just that is how play if anyone listens or watched the end of season review we did last season i think i said something like you play the game in a way that does enable you to have massive highs and big pain well you i didnt think that this i didnt think that this move was going to provide the big pain though i didnt i didnt think we envision that no but theres always one if theres always one guy that potentially can always do it then its the person whos got 26 points out of my 55 and thats earing harland and i got 55 points but realistically 41 points of its gabrielle and holland and then everyone else its the same one points for my other two forward isak and mun one points from doter one point from a keeper two pointers all around lay wipe out for robinson perfect mate two pointers look fantastic i dont youre strikers mate you dont mind it if its like defenders you get it they can lose points its true when you got the liverpool number nine the newcastle number nine and the fip number nine and they get fre points between them youre like good two of them only got 45 minutes in for various for different reasons which isnt ide they got they got about 115 minutes between them incredible ms got about 20 hes got 45 and 59 j get j got 59 didnt he that half time okay cool right some 15 minutes which is pretty good for us getting onto the games lets go lets do it and then on to the second game we dont need about north are we do we i think we should i think we should i tell you what apart from the goal i enjoyed the whole game i genuinely did i thought i thought we were well in control and i didnt feel like we were going to have that control but we did and i thought it was a decent game for tottenham fan to watch i was never felt like i was in any danger except every time the ball went out for a corner and like when the ball goes out for a corner after 21 seconds im like christ here we go and then we defend a few and we look a bit more resolute and everything looks all right and it i think its okay but the one big thing that were not doing is were just not creating chances of high enough quality now theres a there is a caveat here that arsenals defense is better than most defenses you play against so maybe that is what happens in a game like this but at the same time this is not the first time weve seen it and i think its going to be a concern going forward so even though im im still high on salanki for the next few weeks theres not enough theres not enough data theres not enough information for me to say that sank is not going to be a good pick in that position im just worried maybe about the types of the types of balls hes going to get the type of i cant think of the word the distribution hes going to get it feels quite slow and progressing and therefore like they have a lot of the ball but its the lot of that ball is with romero vaner van through to the center midfielders i did feel like i feel like we didnt try and trap him at all they were trying to counter us we were a little worried about getting caught on the counter and then it was like we played just safe ball you knew where the next ball was going all the time you knew when it was going to romero the next time it was going to go either going to go to benton cer and then go to parro or it was going to go to romero then it was just going to go to parro and it was from there it was going to be something into johnson and then the cross was going to come in low and thats how it was going to be about parro and go high but it sometimes in the first half we did try to find that ball to try to find that line breaking pass there was but it wasnt frequent enough didnt feel frequent enough their shap was when theyre sitting in theyre sitting in when they got georgino and party you got to drag up you got to do some things i do think benton kir compared to bit basuma when you see it is like basuma will basuma almost draws people in by looking like hes going to lose the ball sometimes and then s nicks it past people and does stuff so its it gets people off guard we did paint by numbers the attack quite often you knew every time sun got the ball out one on the left he was going to be like right what im going to do is quick hold up and come inside on and ben white and then someone will overlap it but sacker will go with it and it just it was alwayss its good its good but it was almost a case of they did let us do that quite a lot theyre more than happy to grind out that way they werent we werent getting them on the break there was there was a weird we spell was there just before half time about 30 minutes in where suddenly it just got loose for some reason i was like i dont know whats happened here suddenly it was like ending game for a little bit but that was about it other than that it was a very control and genuinely about two minutes before the goal i was like this just feels like a goal where theres only two ways this is getting decided its either a set piece or its a mistake it didnt feel like it was just going to be on merit straight away something else going to come out it was just going to be set p and then up he goes and up we dont go and thanks i dont i dont get it i just dont get it and i know you think ive got an agenda against him but i just dont i just dont understand him in his own box this is this for everybody here is that is that adam hates romero its not that i hate romero its that i hate the fact that he cannot head he cannot head the ball when hes defending like from set pieces from crosses nothing like he just he positionally terrible hes for a guy that walks around with his chest out is just weak in contact and i understand what you were saying earlier which was surely we put the tallest guy on there blood blah which is which is correct but cel is also a threat so i dont understand its not the threat though is he gabrielles the threat this what this one is my this one is that gabrielle is the threat the threat of threats the one that youre going to concede to if any if you do the perfect stuff one you still to coned is gabrielle and tottenhams big problem is that they stick romero whos not very tall not big hes not hes hes good at getting on in the in the opposing box but hes never been good defensively on it but the other guy whos bigger whos 64 nobodys nobodys ever seen him head out of set piece ever its never happened in the history of in the history of his career hes never headed out a set base then maybe thats why hes not defending against the best header in thats a problem isnt it you cant have two defenders that cant hit a ball i dont i dont i dont disagree i think romo has to be stronger flaps and stuff but ultimately harry kane carried this team on hitting balls and we dont have harri kanane so weve got weve that its still a problem that gets exploited when you play the best set pce teams thats thats the problem and you can do you do all the hard work for ages but if you let if you let gabriel have one header six yards out theres only one 64 like this is what i dont i just dont i just dont understand how he allows him into that position though like its not even its not even the heading bit thats the problem like the heading bit is the problem but its not even the heading bit so much did like in the first off there was there was one where he was like about 30 yards away from the goal it was like he was on the third row of the stand before the before it went in and then he comes running in from like absolute miles out theyre so good at multiple target movement like but i dont want to stand here i dont want to sit here like shrugging my shoulder going okay arsenal have just done that because theyre good at thats not thats not good enough on a day like today right like an can turn around and say like the big picture is this that and the other but we should be go we should be looking at this game saying what the has just happened here this is this is just not good enough right this i dont disagree with it i think its just i watch a lot of nfl the deliver is great dont get me wrong deliver is great nfl is all set plays right and when youre when you play a lot of fantasy ffl youre like i know that wide receiver is playing that secondary and i know thats it and theres nothing they can do about it they cant go im just going to magic and put another one on his shoulders youre like hes going to have a good day and he does and thats a little bit how arsenal are theyre so good at set plays that if they decide if they its very hard when they get it right get the delivery right get the runs right get everything right eventually at some point they get in and we knew that and the way we need did to combat that was scoring and we didnt score if you dont score you get done thats thats the history of football and thats thats the same against leicester one new up if you dont score again when you should be for 4 five now up you get done like thats thats the continual problem of an ball is that it allows you to get done its a problem next week if we lose to brenford therell be booze definitely ands in ands in trouble if they lose next week i agree im saying they look at that im trying to be as impartial as i possibly can definitely a were hurting as a team its its four points its not enough its not enough if youd have taken these four games and you de said where do you want to be after four games were turning this into a spurs pod just lets finish on this bit where do you think where do you think would be acceptable after four games like given the fixtures that we had six seven points probably lets lets say we win the first two draw at newcastle and lose today of course we dont accept losing against arsenal but if youd have said that first four game seven points like were three points off that now but it but its more the way in which weve contrived to do it to ourselves the worst and and then the same on the flip side of that is the way that an is justifying the fact that weve got no points is the fact that were playing well way thats why it turns toxic if you continually dominate games and get beat it feels like your plan isnt good enough agreed its harder to blame the players its harder to blame the players when the players are on top fair you turn on the manager like thats that is just thats just well its just its just a thing that you can change its its a thing that you can change thing that you can change man right but from an asset point of view lets just close this out from an fpl point of view porro next week brenford do you feel like thats a good i if youve got better options no theres no better option theres no better theres liverpool defenders and theres par thats it for next week in this league theres theres liverpool options and theres par nobody else is close if you were picking a free hit team next week par would be in it be in everyones free hit team everybodys thats as youre saying it because youve got options because you just wild card mate well okay fair but if youre on free hit youve got every g youve got every option and everybody would have it im not sure im not sure everybody would happ it is the city arsenal game that gives it the that makes it more difficult for next week just wondering what other games there are next week you still have him well lets do brenford lets go manity brenford lets the next one cool nothing to say on arsenal players good from gw six lets do brenford where is brenford man city brenford cool so theyve lost their only striker that feels like a big problem so youre telling me your bench power and they got no strikers not a single stri no thats thats thats fair can we talk about the challenge by the way i think its a red i think its a straight red i didnt i didnt understand it when they when they said it had been checked and everything was fine and the yellow c was okay i didnt get that whatsoever like if youre for lets to quote it endangering an opponent and the opponent cant can barely walk off the pitch i think hes i dont think hes hes exactly safe in that moment exactly safe more than safe and its its horrible like hes completely killed their game they were so good they come out the blocks theyve absolutely gone to town on city for 10 minutes could have been multip but theyre still in the game even though harand scored those two goals theyre still in the game whats it goes i had to check myself later in the day that i was like did i go finished 21 because it felt like it finished 41 it was so stroll around knock it around maybe get my hat trick maybe get my hatrick type stuff there was no nerves about it at all didnt get into a maybe theyll get the late equalizer type space because it completely flatlined them thats because they were playing man city but its huge for them noa like bumo so you got bumo you got kevin sharda you got fabio cavello you got le p was play left back not left wing he left back but realistically like theyre your people thats what youve got now as a as forward options they good run fct is coming up but if it is five six weeks for wha it should be good for boomo because it should mean hes up front he should he should be moving centrally surely and hell just be flanked by would he not just be flanked by shard on the left and le potter on the right l p play left l parts left and shs left and shs left theyre both left theyre both left well maybe you just play one of them down the middle fabiio caro as well likes the left theyre lacking play the right they might play c as like a false n keep them on the right but its definitely its definitely not a good thing for bournemouth is it hes been absolutely brilliant he would have been a lot of peoples game with six wild cards apparently five six weeks is the old estimates thats to the next international break in it till 9 at least but holland if you think about it before this is he was expected to score 11 xg hes currently overperforming xg he did as expected did as expected like two goals is as we spoke about it on the team election being no one no one thought it was like a 22 week everyone thought potentially it was like a 10 week in terms of terms of points performance and if he scored two goals he gets 13 points thats thats l on now but hes had hes had some very good chances at the end of the game and i dont know if you saw him at final whistle because im pry sure you didnt want to see him be was absolutely livid with kevin de bruyne because he could have played him in right at the end and he wanted the hatrick he wanted it thats thats seeing arsenal today i was still considering looking at him from that game and thinking could you cap him next week game the games going to be the games going to be completely different next week its going to be citys first proper test cuz chelsea were chelsea were chelsea were ragged right chelsea were ragged at the start of the season and still figuring stuff out they still are so i think next week will be a completely different game ill be interesting to see what they do midweek on champions league if the likes of foden and rod start and look good and od guards definitely out i back i just back city to do the job a lot better than what we did the job today and im like i dont know i dont know its as ridiculous an idea as it sounds a way it is it is at the emirates so its is at the emirates right i think in a way like im like well that should mean hopefully that we have more of a dingdong game on it but its its very its very difficult to not say youre going to captain captain salah next week but i wouldnt be surprised if he still over 100 owned holland next week i think i think bournemouth have shown themselves to be man city okay its at man city its at man city okay well then maybe then then that just goes up a level with last game of the game week all that business all that stuff i dont know im im going to watch im going to watch the champions league in midweek but im not as 100 on salah as i would have been before this game started but is that because like if salah if salah scores two goals against forest is that different conversation if he was any good at forest its a thats thats also fair but hes been hes been very good at hes been very good in all the other three games so well hes got the turns in all the other three games but thats thats what we pay for well thats what you play for some players its its for holland there to do but he did have some work to do in the liverpool one so lets lets go liverpool because theres not well the only other things you can talk about with city is the fact that lewis played inverted left back and it is interesting because we get a leak dont we that lewis is starting there was a leak that lewis was starting all sounds fantastic but the people that knew he was starting i bet they probably also play his left back and if they told us he was playing left back i dont know if i was a late person that brought him in and then found out and did on a leag well youre working on a league you cant you cant complain too much but thats not good thats not good if you knew that walker was also starting you would be like i dont like that and then the great thing i thought for city was that when youve got walker progressing down the right and youve got greish progressing down the left party all just went number 10 again did whatever he liked if walker and walker and gish start playing then vards insane like he could have he could have done a lot and saino gets five shots should p attention sino is not expensive five shots is nothing to sniff at but holland its just the thing with holland is that you remember the like ton re thing used to say that if he had a if he had a right foot hed score 100 goals it was in that thing he did a quote where he to him and it was after a champions league game he said if you had a right foot youd score 100 goals well what hes done is instead of crying at getting a right foot what hes done is learned to inside of his boot dig off the left foot which is exactly the same as hitting the ball off the right foot thats what he now does said so previously if he had it hed always slot it bottom left because he only had left foot and that or he try and go around the keeper left side now he effectively doesnt have to open his body so its less telegraphed he just uses that little inside dink off his left foot hes not got double the ways of scoring and its that extra its that extra touch as well i dont know whether you see just before the goal go just before he takes the shot its the extra touch as well hes moving it thats thats effectively his way of moving under his right foot is moving it into the position to do the to the left foot dink and then as soon as soon as one keeper works that out itll start switching it up it just start switching it up it just start switching it up cuz youre like how does he keep dinking this in the same places cuz like everyone cuz hes still hitting it his left foot its less telegraphed its smart as hell he is smart as hell people underestimate how smart he is like or but when you hear him you know he is smart but mean everything about everything about that goal was clever right just a little just a little bump on the back and made it look like he was run into and gives him that extra bit of space everything about it was class i thought we said callum hudson ando couldnt continue this goal like this exact this exact goal like how much would you bet that he like you cele you probably didnt celebrate it because you got a double all defense but i celebrated it because of the fact of the goal like goes in i was like i was watching it on this on this tv in front of me and i was just like yep thats exactly how i expected h to score this the only way he knows how its the only way he knows and keepers just have absolutely zero chance noo is just nuno he done so well with this hes done so well with this like give the man some credit with this because this is on this is on nuno and on slot this game in terms of what hes done here its interesting that slot in his i thought his press conference afterwards hes like that he said something like something like we were let down by some individual performances but youll only ever hear me talk about the team and i was like jell quanza is not quite like its an interesting one that he said we were let down by some individual performances didnt didnt name them because he said you so im not going to tell you they are but some people he didnt like for how they performed but to take if you continually make ridiculously early subs just because you havent scored yet like the games not over in 60 minutes its not over like theyre the momentum of this graphic says its all going nicely its all going nicely and then and forest are doing absolutely nothing theyre doing nothing you make free all subs i feel like im old man but i dont know the remember of times this weekend i saw people managers doing three subs at once when they werent even winning by one goal or werent even winning youre like or like was it in one game im like who does three subs at once feel like peps conditioned us now that dont do that like pep never does it does he is hes hes even smart enough pep that if he needs to make like he made a double sub on saturday he does it at half time because hes got 15 minutes to break the shape into what hes going to do he wouldnt do it like if youre going to do the changes just do them half time but you do them 15 minutes into the half and its like well now weve all got to try and get up to speed and change all this stuff but youve also shown your hand and nuno goes trents gone is he theyve theyve taken off mallister have they theyre bit open on the left side of center midfield or we could swing that all over suddenly a little bit more open and ill get what well do is well put hon ad do over there and hell score his goal and he does exactly that like its its its its brilliant management but its also slightly naive from liverpool an extent because its not like they were cutting forest open already if you werent happy with it just do it half time at the same time they could have they could have been a couple up early on as well l diaz hits the post and does it the post but it is a 01 xg chance 01 is all right 01 is not a lot not when youre at home the only the only chance above that 01 is jotter thats the miss js miss thats the only one that gets to like quarter of an xg like dont forget this is not the scale it doesnt get one like you cant with their attack do it but its because they enabled them to sit in we were looking at the past mch before we started just for this game and it was something that it it stings because were tottenham fans so we see this all the time there is tottenhams one but we liverpools one so the past map here for the people are watching effectively youve got this basket and then youve got this like sit on his own which is j so js never being js never passing what this means to and hes not being passed to either hes just standing as number nine hes in the way but effectively trent is close to mo on the right hand side these are the past maps for the first 60 minutes so before the substitutions but soas li i thought so that was one of the worst games ive seen so had liverpool in this in that he never tried to progress it centrally they were never trying to play into and out of jotter or they were never maybe he was let down by some poort decisions on the guys outside him but diaz and mo just stayed very wide and then they couldnt cut inside so they just they sat in well forest i thought they were solid this is a team as well by the way theyve lost both their sixes effectively lost the gone the first week of the season then tangaro was out so lost both their defensive midfielders gone to anfield and sat in and they did they didnt have enough artistry if anything it missed harvey elliott he is he has got something out in harvey elliott that does manage to unlock these things there was a lack of magic in the middle he tried to address it by putting trent effectively which is interesting that trent stayed on and then trent not only stays on but effectively trent went to l number 10 that should be good it should be good conversely it kills off any it kills off any baseline hes got and this positioning as well because hes so close to mo hes not be hes not able to get those key he only had one key pass i think yesterday u and hes bas wheres he going to get it to exactly theres no one theres no one to pass to cuz hes ahead of soas and soas is as you say hes he had a poor game yesterday js not doing enough and again so baseline of five yesterday which if hes sitting if hes sitting where jotter is feels okay because hes going to be hell be getting you points through assists and goals and stuff but if hes not getting those nice then it doesnt feel it doesnt feel good well what i felt when i was watching liol last yesterday was there was loads of good everythings hit with good technique what like trent crosses were like every single one they look so impressive but they never connecting because its just not enough in there to connect them with its is this why are we seeing this as a as why klopp maybe favor j for long periods because there just isnt that wonder real target i do wonder if gpo was there or darwin like either or just someone with maybe another 12 inches on the height i think i think its why darwin looks even more lost when darwin comes on like round the clock when darwin came on he always looked like he was going to score four goals he missed the ball but he always looked like it was going to score four goals now when he comes on it doesnt even get the chances you see you see his face like his sad face in replays therell be like a replay from behind the goal and they just be standing there looking sad almost getting a rebound or doing stuff but like its not like you couldnt keep darwin quiet could you no he was always just a hassle teams are sitting in a good way for them look lots ball games in he dont have to respond to it but he needs more from so soide needs to be a big leader for that team in the number 10 position and hes completely relying on him for minutes now because elliotts out i think if elliott was fit he talked about elliot quite a lot in his press conference on friday and thinking i know why now is that when its not working too well hes a game changer you still its still a good game though is it still home to bourn its a good game orbe it bourn chelsea should we go for i was going to say lets just lets just lets just go there lets just crack on if we whe there any good on their road and it they are theyre a strong team at home small stadium syndrome its their own place they are they are good first half they could have just absolutely blown him away and then they should be they should be in the lead with the penalty but who knows how do you feel about the about sending off we talk about one earlier but i dont know that is double jeopardy that for sanchez that i didnt feel like to play at all the isnt the rule isnt the law about making an attempt at the ball of which he made none no he took the player out no he just took the player out so it should just be a red card should just be a red card so the reason they didnt it was the referee said that he made aemp play the ball which he didnt sur var can clarify that watches its a very difficult its a very difficult thing to say that he didnt play for the ball i dont know i think i think you can if the ref says i dont think he made a play for the ball and the v says well it looks like he doesnt make a play for the ball come and have a look let us know like at least just look at its the panto thing like they only go over if theyre going to change it etc but no just have another look do you think cu its because it is a subjective interpretation right its up to the referee the referee looks at again and goes n still think he was making a play for the ball okay yellow card move on hes there he sa a pen good save good save it looked hard to beat him dont know if its the orange kit or hes so tall but before he even took it you were like this does doesnt look easy to easy to save and then and then the save it looks like he fills the whole goal i and then inu scores and then inu no cant do it can no cu no because chelsea looked a bit better when sancho comes on how much can we trust that i think i think the thing with chelsea is or just in this is like people say like you cant buy class and stuff but in football you can if you buy enough if you buy enough players if that other team doesnt score you just keep chucking them on till they do like sancho comes on and hes better than the other one and k jackson was a handful for him like he was the only one that was causing any trouble for them he always brings the xg he just misses them and but you bringing kungu on bring a 78m pound striker on and at some point someone will score the worry is palmer for this is that zero shots one chance created for 003 xa is this like we said it about this keep saying it what is mesco ball like what is it what are we looking into because we heard the old warnings from leicester that it could be a bit dull is this is this the doll its a difficult one because the fixtures say we were looking at what we looking when i was looking at wild card i was looking at jackson as an option and i coed on it from a double up because i didnt feel the fixes were as good as they as they seemed so bournemouth away west ham away and then brighton at home those three before making a move i didnt feel like those three were as good as fix your tickets fix your tickets making the are green for those four bournemouth away for bournemouth away west ham away brighton at home and forest at home now and forest stalkers going up maybe theyre not as good as that but you believe in palmer you believe in pal we seen nothing to say not see it but you see this and youre like well not involved not involved today next day hes got half an xa and three assists right so its its still assists are noisy do what assists are noisy they are i do want to see him score goals i dont often want to see chelsea score goals but you want to see palas like you expect to see palmer score goals pal shoot and if hes going to play if hes going to play in that like little 10 spot then he should have opportunity to shoot we always used to speak about kdb right we used to speak about kdb and whether we should have him as a do we want him as a goal scoring asset or do we have him as like an assist asset who gets the bonus all that stuff hes hes in that hes in that level for me where most of his shots are going to be taken from around and outside the box and that means that he is going to have a lot of low extry chances thats just the way its going to be but but hes good enough that you be fine hes got that but similarly again looking at if you look at those passing those pass maps its only the first half hes very tight m is it mada and him just but theres no one in the middle like there is no center there is no central but it is itsit its we are starting to see that now so its a split pair so its so its right and right sided two right sided guys very that side and two left sided guys that side and theyre not occupying a lot of middle space i dont know i dont i dont know its a hard week is its so hard to make any judgments from it because it is post international break and everyone has been crappy i think he not like my god look at this guy i think anybody whos sitting on palmer though is very likely either while carding in game week six or if they dont have sacka already theyre looking at a path down a sacker for game week six anyway so i think its just a case of having for the west ham game and then let him go i think its pretty i dont anyones looking now at like longer term things no but i think theres a lot of people that are thinking so ive been thinking if world card six is that id have no salah and i have palmer and palmer and saca okay instead of salah and you look at this and youre like i thought i thought salah was poor in the game i thought he made some terrible decisions and shooting we didnt need shoot and sorts of stuff still rather have more than palmer right now and i think hes worth the extra couple of million on palmer right now do i think ws and palace away in six and seven is better for salah than it is for palmer home to b to forest maybe do i think the fixtur is after that are better for liverpool they are but maybe instead of either of those you go a bit bigger up top and you just get mr watkins in that was smooth i like that i do like that just get mr watkins in because he was always this was he wasnt just going to continue not to score goals was he the team is still do what i was like to make a couple of notes down about certain games and the name the thing i wrote down on villa is its still all about ol its still all about olle and interestingly emory said after the game he was like im so i was so pleased my striker and he was talking about duran and i when he said it i was i just it was almost like he didnt even acknowledge the fact that watkins originally just banged a brace in expectation but when the notification come its like two things you expect when this notification comes in for villa goals its one is its probably watkins and two is its probably not rogers theres various we a lot of us have got rogers and not many of us have got that was a decision that was a decision that i made late on wild card which is a bit which is a bit frustrating and shout out to shout out to meds whos in the chat meds does our thumbnails hes a villa fan so shout out to him for this wonderful thumbnail that we had today with all of the terrible points on there the second goal in particular like just his awareness to be in that be in that position ahead its its like its michael keane so okay but ahead of him there just to slot the ball away is just elite forward play thats thats all it is six shots mate its six shots hes over one xg man definitely should have been walking away definitely should have been walking away with hatrick its same exactly the same what in holland there its its like here you go six shots everyone xg youre going to be all right youre putting yourself in the chance to get yourself a hattick and didnt didnt get it this is slightly this is a different world to the bournemouth one where everton like because everton after 15 minutes that first 15 minutes they should have been free0 down in 15 minutes it was they would they couldnt get out and then luckily theyve got well class d manil i think hes good when he can get into if he can get in i me he gets the assist he gets the assist for calv l as well so hes on set pieces if he can get in between midfielders and defenders he can cause trouble like hes hes very good at causing trouble how often that happens i dont know the fixtures are good though hed back him to score more points than rogers wouldnt you absolutely pedigree more than anything if you had the chance to go again right now with lester away palace at home newcastle at home it switch away fulham at home southampton away west ham home said you can have rogers on mcneel who you have him i probably go mcneil but then that would give me watkins right so i just do that do it that way around and thats and thats where i was in terms of like having mina or having watkins but just didnt i was just scared of not having bruno which is stupid but on that last game mention seo had nothing we love him but he had he had nothing no chances and he was covering right back a lot like he was covering down that he was doing lots of good work lots of tracking but tavanir and evan nson were having the fun up the top and cver for example there only so many so many attackers they can possibly have at one time on it but but neil on all set of pieces the p we joked about it with andy but he is an option at 55 m we joked about luca de as well i mentioned it i mentioned lc de we we shut you down a lot quicker on very quickly on lca de and then gets another assist but like with rogers i feel like he goes away i think hes got like the how can i put its almost like a jud bellingham film feel about him whereby hes hes this big fish in a small pond in the england under 19s or whatever and he looks like hes the absolute daddy and everything runs through him and he controls what goes on and so the performances and the output match the expectation from him here s the big guy so hes always looking to try and put it on the plate for him and hes hes always trying to like help ole make things work for olle which is why i feel like some of those passes that he makes into him when theyre just out of reach and like watkins is absolutely fuming you it is those centimeters that make a difference there was there was just before the manil goal there was there was a bit where there was watkins took a tough shot and if he just let the ball run it goes to rogers and he and rers tried to moan at him watkins is like whatever mate this is my thing whatever i dont think im ever going to stop coughing by the way jesus no starts at some point theyll play watkins and jan together thats the worry im at some point its coming in it at some point its coming hes hes going to demand hes going to demand minutes like he almost he almost topped the goal that he scored did you see that he almost tos it with the bic b hes just a banger and its not like hes he has a go at these things all the time loves it hes good good is c a cheap is c lein a cheap option though well cal le is an interesting one for me because next week everton are away to leicester and so if everything goes okay and any second y ofa starting we have some indication that theyll be starting then i suspect that munis doesnt start and i then have to make a decision on transferring him to another striker and the options are joe pedro so were going to talk about all these in the next couple of games joe pedro jamie vardy or cav and cav and vardy you gotone well off eddie and ky already not next week not for a one week pun okay for one go home to man united its one week one week and out okay its one straight game youre use a transfer on a onewe punt given that you can carry transfers over what and then is not playing theyre fine fine of course got no choice have to one week pun theres not theres not theres not mo has lost his place mate like thats thats a problem and so and its not a good game anyway hunter newcastle no i agreed so yes you have to use it cal len looks all right hell be on pens as well wont he so be on pens but weve also seen him get taken off because hes not been all right thats thats thats the issue so lets do the next lets do the next guy which is jamie vardy before we do jamie vardy d has just mentioned that we weve been on for about an hour which is cool and theres now over 500 people watching so if you are watching hello and if you want to hit the like button that would be absolutely fantastic theres like 150 likes which means 350 of you are not doing your job properly and also please if you want to see more from us make sure you hit the subscribe button and we would be truly grateful as we move to palace versus lester there he iser there is the man there is the big man hes now a much bigger man than he was before this game like matas very interesting very interesting all of a sudden because t penalty and i think theres some people that saying that how did we not know that mata was going to take penalties or not be involved in the conversation i dont think i dont think there was ever a conversation about whether hed take a penalty i think we all just assumed that every time that e was on the pitch e took all the penalties so mata took penalties last year but only when a was injured i think i understand it right but mata took penalties in the summer fine that makes again makes perfect sense it took penal the summer its in france and i think we talked about this i think we to talk about this on a pot i cant remember which part it was i think end of season it must have been maybe with harry i dont know but we definitely talked about some point about how good he was at penalties like he takes him like tony doesnt he takes him its got that big dog energy about him the way that he does it what is of hes never missing so as soon as hes taken one youre like well thats thats it now for life like bumo is good at penalties but tonys tony so he took him forever and thats how i feel like this is es like boom hes hes good at penalties but number nine thanks takes a penalty youre never seeing that ball again its its when i its when its when glasner after the game says well theyre both penalty takers and i let them decide on the pitch im like if im look at him im not im not standing im not im not standing up to mata saying can i can i have this one please jean fle mate you number nine mate was anyone ever getting the ball off you no chance z chance like zero chance see zero chance i to you and sayam can i have that no like even if even if id missed a penalty it was like no absolutely not absolut because i have to score the next one thats how it works so he is suddenly a marvelous ops well done for those theres quite a few people that went early because of the fixtures and this player in particular who im sure didnt get him in assuming he was going to be on penalties but there you go and just staying with it the first goal thats not off side is it thats not that is off side sorry that is offside they just messed it up i just i just dont know i dont know because you looked at it and youre like thats offside and then they drew the lines and you could still see the head the other side of it and youre like thats still offside like its even the most unlucky thing in the world that the man blocking the cross by him trying to stop a cross has ended uping goal cuz my assumption is my assumption is the line thats on the line thats on the the down the line image is exact is tagged as exactly the same line as is on the out the the further away image im assuming its designed that way so they both so you dont move the line you put it down once and then the image just the ai will just say this is this and this is this its on the same photo etc which i which for me i would trust i would like to be like okay cool thats thats how it works but it never it never looks on side like in any in any of the photos and they little la arrows which i think the tv put maybe put on im not sure even sure if they put them on but the arrow came from the guys leg but it didnt come from matas head and its definitely matas head that where he is im like i think its not helped by the camera screen paned to madly in the ving and as soon as it paned across to him i got like like ant and deck vibes mean just give the go just give the go mate i dont believe this i dont believe this so theres that vardy vard has one shot one goal can we talk about how hes absolutely rinsed gayy as well like at 37 years old hes like rinse like rinses him and played 90 minutes again its mad it is mad red bulls are fun they didnt do much cuz they didnt score they didnt they didnt score or to get any chances but the round the ke bar you dont see anyone go around the keeper anymore like its just so rare it was it was good well you saw try to do it in the game before didnt you k is just yes k just nicks it off his toe god god as for palace i dont understand this fre the back i just dont get it i can just i feel like everywhere im roll out and say why are you doing this but you good before the back you decided to go free at the back if youre going to go free at the back what you need is a central playmaker a good playmaking defender and they had that his name was anderson you need somebody that can pass through the lines do the extra stuff now i think laqua can do that a bit but this league is harsh he was ripped apart is for both their goals i thought he was slightly a fault for him i just dont know why hes still playing this it doesnt it doesnt make sense to me and then it just hurts everyone theyre so limited the places in which they can get the ball to anyone like ands had loads of shots six shots in the end like that and six shots six shots but partially thats helped by the fact that they were twonil down 3xg but six shots but hes hes hes getting more shots than this because they were they were behind it so up until that point he was covering mostly most of the time hes sitting her right back is i dont its its a hard one its a hard one but i definitely think theres nothing wrong with intio 59 its looks good hes playing it looked like the iou role and iu used to be relatively productive at relatively cheap ones and hes better than iou so youd expect him to score more points tonight but it feels just in terms of just in terms of i dont i dont feel like any of the fixes coming up feel good for doubling up on palace assets no next week everton okay and then whos that after that liverpool no as a still their best player he still had still had free shots hes still had fre chances created hes still the for of the team but if hes not in pens thats thats a hit and then if theyve got two playing strikers thats a hit on his bonus so hes now got some bigger issues plus theyre playing five defenders so if they do over clean which they dont but if they did thats not a good remover no so theres theres a lot of things where its like well e would be guarant he going to get all the points and stuff to suddenly im like not so sure he guaranteed to get all the points that happens that happens in games where you just you still just trust that at some point he will get physical returns rather than the bonus element i know its bad on his bonus but if he scores and mata doesnt then its fine but the likelihood i think of i think mata holds a very maybe not quite a harland esque type position in this side like a tony position but in the sense that you feel like when palace scor twice hell get one right you dont you feel like itd be unusual for palace to score twice and mata not to be involved in that conversation i cant say that exactly i cant say that i cant say that i just so its maybe about more about picking like if you if you havent got to e yet and you are thinking of a palace asset i think mata is probably a good option and then you play is a genuine conversation in terms of a striker with i still think we need to see more for i think sans sample size is so small that we cant make anything of it because hes played tet over nicholas jackson now though i think id go there nicholas jackson but you still need to be able to you still need a but you would replace him elsewhere and youd upgrade so you wouldnt have to play mateta every week i still wouldnt play mateta every week if i had the option to i dont about that you going to take a million and a half youre just going to stick it in your pocket youll stick it youll stick it somewhere where it matters thats the thing he could he just could be he likes hauling he likes hauling ive still never had one of his halls but he likes hauling midv playmakers lets go to your other one it did give you a return lets go to bruno man be you were golfing during this wen i was golfing during this i didnt watch this game so you tell me well what i said is im sure you watch like highlights and stuff like that but with it but what you never pick up from highlights that you will from watching bruno is that last 20 minutes and certainly when i said last 20 minutes last 15 minutes of regular time and then the six or 7 minutes it was injury time god he was so close to scoring so many times its just it just has that in him where last 15 minutes were winning here im im going to be on this and i was amazed it was gacho the snatching in the death because even right to the end like he just gets further forward last man waiting for it making the right runs he was so he was deep during that first half they struggled in general and he was back in midfield and he was doing the stuff but that last 15 minutes he still was like im going to score here and if he scores and he gets already got the assist to gets a bonus with it youd have had double digit if you ask me is he worth like a million and a half more than eay before this weekend would i have said that no coming out this weekend would i say that i think i dont think hes a problem in your team at all bruno he could comfortably have dou this game he just gets booked instead because thats how he is thats how he is hes just constantly moaning and then kicks the ball but theyre getting some clean sheets they were i know theyve had a couple of good chances in that first half but up until the penalty it was just a matter of time before s scored it was just a matter of time dibling the right winger 45 was incredible but its because dow is a left back whos not left back and then everything just goes flat from the penalty how comes how comes bbd just doesnt take the penalty i just dont i just couldnt fathom it he was being because ar because archer did well in training doesnt make any sense what reason that is as well i just dont get it youre like and he was doing all the stuff what he was getting people injured he was hurting people annoying people he was winding them all up it he just assumed it and i tell you what if diaz had taken that penalty and scored it at that point weve talked about some five and a half midfield was 12 m0 for example but diaz would be on everyones radar very interesting that so on a sampton point that armstrong would have taken the penalty was on the pitch but wasnt on the pitch but then also didnt come on whilst losing they brought on ross stewart 45 striker whos massive i almost felt like he didnt bring armstrong on because they missed the penalty i bet he lost his at half time i bet armstrong lost his at half time because it makes you look so stupid didnt it youve dropped your penalty taker and then you missed the penalty you wouldnt taken that well sort about how youd form as number nine mate you wouldnt have taken that well if you dropped and then replac him and miss the penalty i missed a penalty and then was taken off about 15 minutes later once that was first half incredible how did you say that i wasnt having a good game so its fine i was just a terrible game so its fine but no im fine brunos good im fine with bruno at the moment i think hes still definitely a book transfer the whisle thing does change g to be the pick i want gacho to be the pick though like gacho should be a pick and hes getting points but hes not playing and im not sure what theyre going to do there because rashford scores ahad was great ahad created six chances and hes very different to the other two like he is good creatively theres a lot of sacker in the way that he plays and that hes quite efficient what like hes passing rates are fantastic like made over 50 passes in the game at like 90 completion like hes hes a very efficient guy i dont see them wanting to pull him out of team xery doesnt look like he wants to score thats an issue but that might change if he scores a you i dont know i dont know i think bruno is still the only pick for me i still wouldnt go anywhere near the defense i know theyve scored other points in this one but i didnt i didnt fancy they were keeping that clean until the p miss and then soton part and this is the surprising as well because this is the plum fixture for them they do their fixtures are still okay for the next few weeks in fact for quite a while but theyre okay theyre just okay right and if theyre okay you want the talisman and the talisman is still burer plays every minute and it gets better as the game gets on agreed we got left brighton fulham and wolves newcastle where you want to go got wolv go today wolves newcastle i was quite happy when when my wife sent me a message about half hour into the game she was like adam can you come and sort out the potato for dinner perfect went downstairs missed the goal perfect timing i was bored though like this first half was boring it was boring it just didnt it was boring didnt take very it was nice i thought it was nice what we just we just we just been huffing and puffing at arsenal it was like anything was going to be nice it was nice well we got used to nice without a lot of goals but i thought w play i thought wolves played some good football i was i was impressed every time i see wolves im impressed with the commitment to play good football its quick its intricate i like what i see i think k is just a baller made some terrible decisions though didnt he made a couple of terrible decisions around in the box and if im looking at well talk about it probably in about four or five weeks time as we come to like game week 11 but all i need the striker not to make those stupid decisions when you got a good fix to run hes going to be cheap though hes a hard one to read hes hes he reminds me a lot of again tony type player where its a guy of i want him in the box and hes hanging out somewhere on the left just having a laugh or decided to just drop deep for a little bit and then suddenly hell just try a bicycle kick somewhere and do some stupid stuff like hes cool to watch but hed frustrate you as well im sure which is why i think theyre plan a striker with him it allows him to have a bit more freedom to do stuff but it still feels like hes the hes the big dog for them newcastle let made mistakes is he said it comes off half time with look like it was a bloody nose how said it was more his eye reporter said they couldnt stop it bleeding and im like what is i dont know thats not great doesnt sound ideal does it no but have to hope for the best that hes okay if hes not okay i dont know hell what i do i have no idea what i do with this team and but gordon was the best thing by then by miles in that first half he had some adar toast he ive just quoted the i think the commentator used at the time i was going to say i remember hearing those words those exact words i just tak them out of my mouth but he did like he hits the post which again wont be a very high xg chance that be the one about 18 20 minutes in but he was everything good was go to him and try and make it happen there is an ongoing thing with isach that it just doesnt stay as number nine does he wants to co again similar just doesnt want to stay in the box and when he doesnt youre like well who else is going to be in the box but luckily they got out of it because they got some players and score bangers i would push i didnt i didnt tweet when sher scored because when it comes off a defenders head i dont i dont want to call it a banger if the if the defender heads it over the keeper im not im not claiming it im not im not claiming it as a banger it doesnt count it counts but it doesnt count its not a banger shanga and share call it wherever you want johnson just just plu plucks that if it doesnt hit dawsons head so im not having it as a banger barns banger no banger stop trying no its too late for that mate and then they get all the xg the last couple of minutes but no one cares no one cares about that so no cares about that but i was sitting there and gordon has to play false again this is like double if isa cant play and gordon plays false n well thats just an absolute disaster because when hes there he just looked miserable he was so miserable i dont know where its just just its general to be though but he look like cant be asked even that the one of the big chances at the end talis one like he was on the whole time barnes has got the ball and hes on the whole time youre like just give it to him but its barn so hes head down hes just running ain doing stuff and then he finally looks up and he goes i pass to you and gordon just waiting for that ball to just come to him and tala just nips in and says ill have that ill have that and ill have a shoot and ill miss it and gordon just wedgied himself just after that he i was going to pull my shorts up and hurt myself and i was like we all know that feeling this weekend mate its its not good for its its its not good but theyre getting results they are grinding results newcastle so youd be happy if youre them and the fixtures are still okay theyre not good enough that you want to get that players in though no but you be got i think i was wild card in i moved on no but if i was wild card and id gone no harland i think id have had esack or watkins and i think would have kept e i dont think i would have done that i know i just my wild card because i was i was on watkins over isack because watkins is watkin and i had a draft i money i had the money for either but ive got a feel i might have push sh kept eack p him away you got the wolves away so but now you full him away city at home everton away not ideal brighton chelsea arsenal no no ill take the wolves home ipswitch away please all right lets go the last game no it last game we still havent done full and west ham yet what do you want to talk about here full and west ham jim gets in scores thats it is it is it sour grapes that i own anthony robinson that i want var to have ch the go off because of the throw in being in the wrong position definitely cuz thats pathetic because what id like to know is if they decided they were going to do that whats the tolerance whats the tolerance because they took the throw in from like 25 yards further than when it went out thats quite thats quite some distance that is a lot quite some distance like and it and so they took it quick the ball gone out diagonal run after and then so it goes out diagonally and then they run back in diagonally so they thir down by time it comes full triangle the further down take it one touch into wings go straight in the goal so its one and they all straight away i think i think silver got book in of course he does for it and im like what would it take for v to go by the way that wasnt the right place and could they i dont know i dont think its a situation theyve thought of no ive never thought ive never thought the thing for it but it is it is like you never see a foul throw right like theres no foul throws dont exist in the professional game they dont doesnt matter how you throw it in the ref just like n just carry on who cares cant even remember who it was i saw this weekend but someone kept f thr and i was like why is no one picking this up cuz when you used to play it used to be a thing but when youre a professional like everyone no one wants to see 20 foul throws given every game thats not entertainment get the ball on theit no the first one is the first f throw its entertainment if youre there the abuse but i was its just so irritating last kick of the game luckily he wasnt in the bon if he was in the bonus god i have been fuming he was he just outside would he was two outside he was outside so but newcastle and city in the next three for fulham it feels like benching opportunity and they got to go to forest as well one thing though on that right refs lets finish with a little moment at refs as were getting there at the end okay one is you give anthony taylor an 800 game on a saturday night you give him prime time viewing and he does four te bookings that was funny like you imagine how happy had gone to bed 14 bookings record a record then you go to our game so it follows 14 bookings plus a game where there was a bit of controversy that they took the throw on in the wrong place now think the next game which was a 200 game for us on the telly how many times did they send arsenal back for taking the throw in the wrong place loads they did it a times just go back it was like so its like an admission of gil and then jared gill goes what im going to do anony and round up i might have been a bit ar last night gave 14 bookings seven in the first half seven in the first half its normal now ref did you hear the ref theyre punishing theyre punishing theyre punishing anything nowadays i did enjoy were going completely off of full in west h but i did enjoy the fact that the first booking of the game was was celba kicking the ball away and not delaying the restart thought it was hilarious given the dean rice situation just like just like that happened so we better back it up better back it up or better correct it overcorrect it so stupid not much more the only thing i was like at again were on these cheapos you can tell a mans about to go on wild card when theyre looking at all the way get cheapos for we all try to think of options that arent arent morgan rogers and not scoring but try oros everything we talk all the time about everything goes on the left everything goes on the left you got the little trio of stuff but what it does mean is he got loads of space on the right and it ends up going tos always there no6 always there because he has a big he has a big header isnt he one of these ts big ts is a big header which i again like adat is not the person that id ever think of heading the go heading the golf ball heading the football but i think hes interesting hes interesting i think hes interesting because hes because he is just like chaos and he is chaos its just so little games youd play him you look at his next game youre like have him as your first sub every game see theres nothing look at the pictures im just even looking to see if theres any like runs theres no runs nah you might even if even when you get like game week 19 theres like four games and its like nope back into man united at newcastle you need him as first s and hope for the best is he five you need him as first five hes five hes five fine five thats thats cool right himz scores himz has to start next game surely mz hasnt scored this season mz hasnt scored himz has himz has himz starts himz scores makes perfect sense you dont ever get leaks for full them do you so youre not going to get any leak on minutes no one cares no one cares no one cares no one cares about those strikers from all the other teams they just want to know about your about the 47m city right left back most important thing youre not getting min leag thats never happening so i think i think if youve got miners you have to gamble this week im sure if harry or ross or any one of those boys wanted to find out about fulham they could go and find out im sure they find out theyre fir away theres any in the nose on fulham hit me up hit me up found someone that was like in the know like newcastle and i messaged him once he said he said hed he said he might have something this was back in the summer i messaged him once he gave me absolutely nothing didnt even respond and now all i see now all i see on x is him just abusing people im like a perfect this is what i need it wasnt will no but no but he gives him which is fair no he doesnt brighton versus h switch and were done and were done and just to knowe i think this is the third keeper that weve got a top bonus this week lets not do any5 do the doesnt do our narra any good mate about they dont they dont concede dont con its in so brighton have 70 possession they have 21 shots ever and ipswitch player low block mh so they play low block versus liverpool and man city you expected that and all the like stats make them look like they were a low block team but they werent a low block team at all in the championship but then they come out play low block and they take all this in and im im a little worried that m that theyre confused that theyre confused that theyve seen burnley come up and burnley very similar type of style play last se in the championship through the premier league and then still went with the swash buckling type way and it didnt work and i think most of us expected it to be swash buckling theyre going to give it everything and dont get wrong they had some chances the its a post and hinson had a chance at the end but most of the chances seem to be after theyve run like 70 yards and people are tired your shots never as good after you run 70 yards but i think they need to work out what theyre what theyre going to do and how theyre going to play these games now s hamptons next week so youd expect them when they play southampton to play in the more custom style we were used to seeing them because hey theyre its two ex championship teams youd hope thats what you saw but but at the same time were like five weeks in and hes been working on this particular setup with them you got to coach it back into coach it back into them for the southampton game like how they played last year i dont know like the first tog but this is not this is not unusual for this is not unusual for brighton like a brighton that were used to seeing versus a promoted side i would id expect this domination on in chances i would expect that especially no we havent mentioned no j pedro in this as well about to go this is this is a paddling this is a paddling i think the interesting pieces youve got mata had three shots two of which in the same ocean which should have buried thats the big boy and the second one for it georgino had three shots wck had four shots bba had four shots m had none no shots whatsoever and i think that is a little bit because of georgino think called geino rooter is how they were saying routa hes very different to pedro j pedro hell sit as the number 10 but he wavers about he goes around and he and he presses high and he does whatever he wants whereas geino felt very right channel alongside well beck mo it became more like a 42 of a striker but that like right side a bit like say like an old like daniel sturd almost type things where hes not a striker but hes also right winger hes like somewhere there which is not good for the right winger so it doesnt surprise me that m didnt get any shots in because he was always in the position where the shots were going to be so hes taking the ball a bit further away from the penalty area not getting in so if i wouldnt be overly panicked because youd assume that pedro comes back in georgino in the next game which probably means its better than for m again but it was quite an alternative like because it wasnt just ill do this one versus this one im like what if occasionally he does want to play like a 442 they maybe maybe he does maybe that isnt good for m maybe occasionally that isnt good for pedro but feel like pedro is too important for him i think you have to just assume that the m back in and didnt score and all that stuff mar gets 11 pointer but you dont you dont its all very well get them pointed but they did need 2xg dont want dont want to be having keepers from teams that can see 2xg no any other takes i dont think so all im just doing is show my age so triple subs bothered me also it switches collars thats going to be my last point for the weekend see i dont even know about hold on got to have a look at how high i switches collars are but like the collar is like its like there its like there on the neck id hate that what am i looking at ip switch collar you watch you watch liam deap after he scores he looks like hes choking himself dont know what theyre doing i dont know where im going i got to find this i dont want to go to the website that slowing right down now look your own time mate i got a picture of amari here you mean what the fact that its thick the blue the thick blue yes like right up here or they i like it that you dont not playing it you not playing in it wa its not that far up his neck maybe it sits differently on other people maybe i dont think is that the actual kit from saturday the dark one sits in like you watch liam the lap it looks like hes got no ill watch it back so high ill watch it back ill watch it back just for that just to look at the color thats thats the inside people are here for weve gone weve gone under 500 people now which means people know that were about to finish which is fine they know its over they know its over hopefully youve had a if you havent had a better game week than me then i dont know what youre doing its its quite impressive to be fair 23 points on a wild card the worst game we could se easily done though is it i dont think it is that easy i feel like you dont have holland it is what this soon take te ill be down to 29 points replace him with a one po 30 points then you take gabrielle out i could be on but were s but were sitting here were sitting here in a position where all the premium assets have banged all the weeks so far like in fact like a premium asset has matched harland in every week so far g in the chats got 22 shout out to you gareth i re you should send gareth some coasters dont do this mate because if you say if you say this every single person l 23 points is want coter mate and im going to end up instead of only if theyre in stream if youre in stream still and youve got less than 2 if someone sat through an hour and a half of us talking about this nonsense all right and theyve got less than 23 points they should

14,fplbanger,UQYBt4uIAdA,FPL GW5: PEDRO ISAK OUT AND CAP WATKINS ? - FPL Tips 2024/25,2024-09-19T05:57:48Z,I think I think Walkins is a good differential cuz not many people went on him and I think with Pedro's injury not many people can go to him even if they wanted to this week is that relevant to a captaincy decision Sam no it's not getable someone is or how it's relevant to the Vibes you get when when your captaincy pays off compared to what everyone else Captain oh this a thing hello everyone and welcome back to the fbl Banger show my name is civa I'm joined by Sam game week five coming in Sam and as a non Holland owner Sam uh you must have had a really fun weekend who's Holland never heard of that name before no idea who are you referring to S so how is FPL Moneyball working Sam how how is it going rebuilding harand in the aggregate how's that going you know what it's it's it's really annoying CU I looked at my team last week right and I got quite a few picks that returned so you know I was kind of happy like I got Watkins right which was great Watkins you know I brought in Saka despite the so-call bad fixure still return quite happy with that gacho didn't start but still return kind of happy with that and then I look at other people who like their whole team blanked except for Harland and the captain Harland and they you know matching my points so that's the reality of f Money Ball I guess but well let's keep going if I had my captain C right so I think that was the only thing they say because I captain Salah and he blanked who would have thought you know might couldn't beat the mighty forest but yeah if the captain C got right then I think I would be you know be doing decently yeah but that's what we said right Sam you know if you recall we talked about value of Holland yeah yeah boring Captain probably good for a goal or two and I I think you just consider yourself lucky it wasn't a hattrick and I was right a bad I told everyone that he couldn't keep it up and he had a whole 33% drop in goals per game so and if you count Champions League I mean that's like I don't know what's the percentage but he's basically finished right blanking against inter finished he washed everyone sand Pep's gonna sub him off halftime he already said this week pep did say I'm going to make uh uh two subs every half time this is the new pep if it was at half R Lewis R Lewis off at half time that's you know that's that's a good question Sam let's just talk about R Lewis uh let's just get straight into it right so we both are proud owners of Rico Lewis and have spent weeks telling other people to get him in uh while we've enjoyed his points and so everyone joined in this week and are very angry at us for saying Ric Le is a good pick and everyone's immediately talking oh we got to sell him now but this to me this was all part of the plan right this is there was a risk we knew going in no yeah yeah I agree I agree a 4.5 City player doesn't come often right City starter so we are always prepared for the fact that he might lose his place somewhere in the near future and we just going of enjoy the points while we still can and once he's you know he's dropped he loses his place then he goes out 4.5 4.6 now I guess you can easily trade it to anyone loads of players that you you know options loads of options out there you think he's lost his place I don't think so I mean not yet but will he keep it what I'm saying is that the potential outweighs the risk so even if he loses his place it's not like he are spending six m on the play or something like that you know it's it's a easy transfer out or you can just bench him like it's 4.6 doesn't really make a big difference that's why I'm saying it's worth taking that risk I was never planning on playing him against Arsenal anyway so maybe I've I think the issues people are having is a lot of people have who have Rico Lewis seem to have decided that he's their third Defender and they have two unplayable people like Howard Bellis and stuff on the bench I mean that's that's a problem but we told you that going in you always have bench cover for him but he's still I think a really decent pick uh even in the inter game uh which is last night he's playing second Striker at certain points like he's just so high up played the full 90 you can look at that good or bad why is he playing champions league but you could look at it as he's part of their best team and so pep is playing him in the hard games uh I think again I would just play him until the benchings become more of a problem yeah I agree 100 okay so that's that's Rico Lewis done very good uh let's talk about jao Pedro s because in in a week where a lot of things went wrong I think the first sign that this was going to be a bad week was when what is it 3:00 UK time Brighton lineup comes out jedro not even in the squad and Fabian herzler the the Brighton manager has he's only been here three weeks he's younger than both of us and he's already bald 31 year old man already bald said nothing in the press conference right he said he just said oh J's coming back we'll see how it goes suddenly oh he's got a knock and he's gone he's vanished not the squad uh for the Premier League game not in the squad for carabal Cup last night so J Pedro immediate sell right yeah plus I think Brighton only has one more good fixture before his starts to turn you know um home game against Forest which is that even a a good fixture because Forest has been pretty impressive you know that this start of the season they have it they have it honestly um but after that Chelsea Spurs Newcastle wolves home and then Liverpool City oh that's a nightmare run so unless I think you have two options either you sell or he just sits on your bench at 5 point what say 5.6 5 point yeah somewhere around seven depending on when went in yeah okay 5.7 he's still a good I mean um how do I put it if you have more pressing issues you can just leave him on the bench but I think the problem is a lot of you guys went with harand Salah Trend loaded up on premium so you're dependent on Jiao fedro starting and that is your issue right now which maybe is a warning in future know do not put a 5.5 forward as your starting player with no no bench cover at all yeah again see I feel like we did say all these things I I for example have ja Pedro but I've got a full playing bench but I'm seeing a lot of people with Langer Chi jebon these are all these names are making up actually they're real people uh Mahoney bunch of non-playing 4.5 forwards and of course you're scared now because you're down to jao Pedro he doesn't play and you're basically yeah you're kind of screwed so yeah cuz also price out of you know making a a step up to another Striker that actually stops yeah so I mean for those who have been careful enough to keep some cash in the bank and also to be fair Alexander isak right we should probably go up in budget and talk about Alexander isak who this week what came off at halftime because blurry vision or couldn't see or looked at his points on FPL and and and just like oh my eyes and didn't appear for the second so what are you doing if because Alexander isak is a very easy question to answer suppose you've got budget to go anywhere where do you go yeah I have isak so I am thinking is he is he confirmed out this week but he wasn't in training yesterday okay we're recording Thursday early morning let's assume he doesn't make it what do you do um I have a few forwards on my short list because I have to make that transfer if it doesn't start the annoy L A lot of the fixtures only start the turn in game week six you know so I think one of the Prime um transfers in I would go maybe is Harvard's back to Harvard because Arsenal has this really nice Run game week six onwards but then he has that City fixture this week other than that unfortunately WIA is out because I think I would have loved to go for Visa but um now he's confirmed out for what is it two months something like that a pretty long-term injury I know that's a lot yeah s go yeah I mean so on on wha being out let's kind of just quickly sidebar to Branford a bit a lot of it's not forwards but I I suppose it does influence especially if you got jao Pedro you can't move branford's got two very cheap Midfield options now Kevin sharder 5.5 million and Fabio cavalo is 4.8 now is he a forward so they're both Midfield this but I think it's relevant because a lot of people will definitely be looking at brenford I personally feel it's uh Spurs is an okay fixture I don't mind it as a fixture but I think it's too early to go in because we don't know if sha plays or cavalo plays and to be fair I don't think even Thomas Frank knows because natural replacement would be Kevin Sharda but cavalo played so well midweek a goal and two assists it seems kind of harsh to just not play him at all and they paid so much money for him as well but surely you know UMO will be the number one brenford pick to have and yeah I mean you could argue you're looking at two assets individually by doubling up but do you really want to use two Midfield slots on brandfit so WIA would have been perfect I think um but unfortunate for the injury other than that I know I know SAA I kind of know where you're hitting with this are you going to suggest DCL okay yes so come back to yeah okay so back to forwards well DCL okay there are two hype every week There's a hyp pick right last week it was J Pedro we saw how that turned out um so this week the hype picks everyone's talking about it the bandwagons are DCL uh and Jamie V what I don't know maybe we've gone back in time like five years ago but let's talk about DCL and to be fair Everton despite sucking very bad they are scoring goals are they two goals against I mean they took the lead that's true that is true and even in game week one they were I would say very unfortunate not to get a penalty uh DCL was basically fouled by Lewis dunk but didn't get the penalty I mean he cheap he's nailed he's on pens he's 5.9 million and this fixture run looks very decent no Everton play Lester and Palace I swi Fulham Southampton the next five next six probably just overthinking this right if you don't go for him maybe maybe but that's also that I don't know I I just don't trust Everton right now leester I switch Southampton you know those are fellow relegation candidates so those might be good nice nice games for them the others could be a bit tough but again like you said they are still scoring they just can't seem to hold on to their leads so maybe and if they can't hold on to the league need to score more goals see yeah that's true that is true maybe I would definitely uh prefer DCL over vadi and because Everton just is a slightly better team than leester yeah I think below six below six Mill this is probably your best option if that's as far as your budget can go I think the concern with vardy is that game week six feels like a blank right they're playing Arsenal and so that's what puts me off vardy I get that he's a really tempting onewe option if you're on wild card game Mi six you get the Everton home fixture this and you're done but gaming six against Arsenal is tough and also Jamie vard let's this is maybe this is the problem about reading stats and stuff like he scored from one shot this week yeah if I'm not mistaken he's taken three shots this season and scored from two I remember seeing that that somewhere on Twitter I could be wrong but um yeah I basically he scores with I don't know is that is that mon on his Fe finishing or is it he oh you're right regression two goal three shots two goals that's insane is this a massive over performance or is this the rate he's gonna he's gonna go I don't know I I think there's just too much risk to go DCL if you had to pick one between the two I would go D although although I'm just going to try it in there that chriswood is only you know 6.1 so if you can stretch for Chris Wood he might be a good sleeper pick because they have decent fixtures Brighton Fulham Chelsea Palace Leicester West Ham Newcastle so you know I I would say only starts to turn in game week 10 so after West Ham game they got Newcastle Arsenal is switch City United Villa so that's when you maybe want to get off but for the next few weeks Forest maybe let's let's not talk about sleeper we leave the other 10 20 FPL podcast to discuss that but back on okay Chris Wood I mean Chris Wood versus detail now that feels like a debate I can get into because I'm not sold on vard and you're not sold on vardy and to perhaps explain why I'm not so of apart from the fact that he's only had three shots I just feel Steve Cooper leester very defensive team in fact if you follow a lot of leester fan channels and leester podcasts they're all quite frustrated with Cooper because he plays really defensive football they've started playing Wilfred and Dei as a number 10 uh for those who don't know IND is basically a DM but he's playing him as a number 10 because he wants that many Defenders on the pitch that's his focus and so I feel like V's just G to struggle to keep this up as good a striker as he is and so for me it's DCL in Wood I I guess the only thing that puts wood off is when you look at the fixtures like we have them on the screen it feels hard right Brighton Chelsea in that in the next three but maybe I need to stop looking at these colors right cuz Forest have been really good and they beat Liverpool they did they look tight um and it looks like you know they just scor one goal a game which is actually what they have done one-1 in the first game the b s enter one nil then another one-1 against wolves and one nil against Liverpool so they just score one goal a game but um well wood scored two of those and in each time he scored three bonus points 6.1 I think it's a tempting pick I will go for wood oh this is hard man this is really hard because Chris Wood feels like I mean a pick that no one's going for this week which that's what makes it tempting whereas it does does wetting your appetite for some Chris Wood yeah yeah this is a hard decision to make man I don't want to go I don't want to take the software out and just go with DCL although that's it I think if you have the budget for it Watkins would probably be the best forward pick of all I mean if he plays 60 minutes but doesn't matter he still scoring and and um I think he did come out and say that it was just like a precautionary you know sub yeah which which sounds good means that he should be okay for the weekend home game against wol is witch United Willam bonm good fixtures yeah if you got the budget to go up to Watkins uh even via two transfers I think that's like a no-brainer this week because you know game week five is kind of a tough week uh the the best fixtures are generally amongst the bad teams like South AF play Zips which you don't really want anybody from either side yeah pretty much my transfer strategy now is just let's see who is playing South Anon this but unfortunately I don't want to bring in any ISR players as well so so this week's a bit tougher I mean to be fair I did consider Liam dap quite a bit uh because again you know sounds very spicy but also I I just thought Southampton anybody can score against them but dap came off on 58 minutes this week and from what I read uh Kieran McKenna the Yip switch guy he likes to make a lot of attacking Subs on 60 Minutes apparently he did this a lot in the championship and he's now got a full set of forwards and midfielders who he can bring on so if that's going to keep happening then no I don't I don't want we've already seen with J this is starting to annoy me I don't need more players who don't play 90 minutes yeah yeah I agree I agree yeah so okay Chris the choice is between wood and DCL for us pretty much yeah wood and DCL I mean Danny wck still not convincing you I'm guessing and to be Evan Ferguson is back now and that's a problem uh which actually ja Pedro issues get worse and worse yeah and by the way Brighton's fixtures really turn in game six onward so I I wouldn't bring in unless you're planning to walk out in game six so it's just a one we punt but you know to use up a a full transfer uh not on a Brighton player yeah Palace and United I'd like to talk to you a bit and also Spurs right because they have three Strikers who all of whom I would say say for minutes uh let's start with Palace because that's the most people who had points this week would have got it either from Watkins or mateta so who has Mata people who had him G one some I mean I had had him in some of my drafts and then I dropped him because I was worried about Olympics and stuff and he did come back quite late um but we saw Matel this week two goals took the pen away from it basically walked up to him and said no man it's mine uh are are you worried with in I mean they both played 90 minutes the last the last weekend yeah but it seems like Mata is the main man still right nailed plays up front I think an had to play off the wing mata's on pant he tucks his shirt in he's a french guy wearing the number 14 these are he's been you know working with Andre over the summer clearly thinks he's above palace's level I mean that's why he's telling a that he's not taking pens um these fixtures are hard to read though and he's quite a high price uh for the fixtures that he has yeah he is quite expensive I would say 7.5 Ina could could be a tempting option if he you know I I don't know well he keep playing 90 every week alongside Mata he played in the uh midweek yeah and both to fair oh did both of them SC uh no Mata came off around 60 and K played I think the full game scored a scored and assisted of course a only uh does these things in Cup games so yeah I don't I I think of all the budget forward options my number one pick would be chriswood okay so still the safe guy amongst all these uh picks uh I just want to ask you Dominic sanki we've gone completely cold on him is that because Spurs were outclassed by Arsenal because they have much easier fixtures now yeah but I think just on a whole I I would like to wait a little bit on Solan you know the injury kind of took some time off that would have been useful for him to integrate into the squad you know get some games together with the rest of the team so I would like to wait and see for Salan I think he's he priced really attractively but for someone who is you know just totally coming in new to the new team I I think it's a wait and see for me and to be fair Spurs were really bad last night uh in the cup against uh commentary they were losing until like 88 minutes and then they scored two last minute goals soan it come off by then so it doesn't doesn't Bard well this looks like a team that's still figuring itself out lot of possession but not a lot of end results just yet and we also don't know who's on Pence so if it's not so lanky then that doesn't make him as interesting I think zi are you are still on Z like I I still positively you know you still see him in a positive light I mean this we'll keep this short because I'm the only person in the universe who owns him right just me and one other guy from work I guess um so I think it's one of those I was hoping to come on the show triumphantly you know I have been the only guy to get the hall anybody who watched that match will tell you that I've been robbed right uh he should have had a hatrick okay um more to have should have had a hatrick almost every single game we play yeah so maybe I found the Dutch dwin unz uh maybe I don't know uh it's early days what I will say is that he was very attacking uh played the full 90 um so in a game where they won 3-0 he had the most XG I feel like at some point one of these has to go in I'm okay to hold I think what what is most positive about their performance was that he was kind of crucial to their linkup play so he yes he didn't score but he gave so much in the linkup and the buildup play that that means he's safe for the next few games United's a very weird team to read like nobody knows you should be positive or negative about them but I always thought the next two fixtures were fine Palace and Spurs these are not great defenses and to be fair I don't think Villa brenford West Ham Chelsea none of these are defenses I fear so happy to hold for now but obviously I'm not recommending him as a buy that was just for me going against the Southampton game take a shot you see you know you you miss all the shots you don't take yeah I went for gacho he didn't start but I was also right in which he is United's best attacking player oh we both right at the same time it kind of balanced out so I didn't get a hall but I got a nice decent six points just I'm happy with it no complain talk about being robbed me I told you gacha wouldn't start I was so confident and you still ended up with yeah the better outcome but fair play Man fair play it was a good goal yeah I I don't know though is he going to start soon he should but at the same time you know rashford did he scor as well well and you know that midweek game in which they won like 20 what was it no n n nil seven n right seven n sorry confusing it with the Bayern game um seven nil yes gacho had two goals and two assists something like that so rashford played up top rashford play up top and scor but again you know it it's a team two divisions lower so I don't know how much we can read into the game but good for their confidence I guess let's see how it goes what if zi gets dropped this week rash's up front Gatos on the left could be a possibility yeah I'm not fortunately for you I'm not worried no I mean zi starts I think the fact that he didn't start midweek is good because well depends how you want to look at it right like Rico Lewis played full 90 midweek uh that's good because pep trust him ja Pedro didn't play that's good because they want to keep him for the weekend zi came on midweek that's good because they had keep him fresh so it's tough tough we are just making guesses actually um to what the manager is thinking that mean that's that's this game entirely press conference is absolute waste of time uh but let's let's talk about United let's let's keep this rolling because moving into Midfield right I think we've covered the forwards uh all the options that you can consider let's move into Midfield because jot is becoming a problem now and even Luis Diaz right didn't start midweek gapo started and had his best per performance this season rashford are you mildly interested 7 mil cheap but moving to rashford no I'm not I'm not there are lots of players I would like but like I mentioned earlier it's a bit annoying that a lot of their fixtures only turn in game week six like I think you know if you don't have an Arsenal player Saka would definitely be a big buy next week uh a brenford Fielder buo possibly you know one of the others as well would be a great buy next week annoying thing is that you know this week this week is it's kind of hard to find a player for this week uh who I mean whose fixture starts turning this week yeah um I'm going to give you one uh he is uh a very attacking midfielder who returned this week he's nailed he's got some set pieces uh he's cheap he's English he is I'm gonna guess I'm gonna guess um Smith r no I I mean I love Smith R but no F pictures are hard this is a guy who plays 90 minutes Sam and he plays for a very unfashionable team oh Dwight mcneel there you go Dwight mcneel what are you serious hey let's let's not knock it wa double digit Hall this week yeah I think that that's that's his quot for the year so you missed it that's it wait wait for next season but I mean d mcneel does very well on all these sort of you're going to scoff right but all these sort of models and predictions and stuff he scores really highly okay he's returned two weeks in a row and he now has a set of fairly reasonable fixtures right Everton fixtures look good and I think we'll all agree that Everton have been undone by their defense right but we don't care about that do we because if the attackers are returning the attackers are returning and he's 5.4 million nailed on 90 minutes how many 5.5 millimes do you have who are nailed for 90 minutes yeah even Smith can make it yeah what about Onana he can't keep the submit I mean surely this I mean I feel bad because I've told like you know casual friends you don't buy Anana he's never going to score again and he just keeps like scoring these bangers and headers and stuff but no I mean real talk I don't see Onana being sustainable in terms that's a that's like picking K mate that's not going to work or like pink picking you know gundogan or some something like that S no no no let's not don't insult me okay Gund and K and hanana different levels okay okay but no coming back D manil you didn't even give me a fair shake you know midfielder if DCL is in your options why isn't Dwight mcneel in in your consideration it just feels wrong don't get me wrong I kind of like dght McNeil I think from a few seasons back as well like he's always been that really hardworking one of the few or only creative player that Everton has so a lot of the burden falls on him but I will go for D over D mcil I think however if and I feel there are just better options in the Midfield slot that you can go for name them there there aren't that many especially at that price no at 5.5 Ahmad Ahmad Dio also not nailed I mean if you you're worried about gacho you're also worried about Ahmad yeah but G has this ability to score even Off the Bench so that's why I'm I'm a bit less with about G yeah so doesn't address the question right maybe you can move up oh what about soo soo slide who has had two assist this season I mean kind of points ticking in but 6.5 not that much and he plays 90 every week he is nil unlike J unlike di it's an option I mean what he did go midweek right so yeah it's it's an option but it's it's a really boring option you're going to get assist you're going to be frustrated some games because he gets the assist before the assist but you know one of those options that will take over if you if if you have strong knes not to transfer him out you know over the cost of many games I think the points could tick I think it comes back to your initial point which is gamei five just kind of sucks right and you want to wait till 6 and maybe get some meno or get the Brandford guy who will play uh if you can't get to embo you could even work your way up yeah I'll I'll give an option see I like that is a bit above the five6 um price bracket but I really like Jared Bowen 7.5 so a bit pricey but has been really good he's WR three weeks in a row by the way no one's talking about it goal against Palace assist against City assist against Fulham and I don't know the fixtures doesn't look good on paper like right here you know if you're if you're watching the video you would see westmer kind of smack in the middle but Chelsea at home they can score brenford probably score if switch Spurs you can definitely score United at home definitely scoreable so I think from an attacking point of view I like bow in fact I'm I think I'm convincing myself to get ven in this week I mean Chelsea's uh I think Chelsea really fortunate against bouth and again so much of this is narrative based right if Evan nson can take a better penalty Chelsea probably lose that game and everything changes but because he missed we're talking about Chelsea as if they're really tough team to beat so yeah don't mind it J Bowen at home and then after that fixtures look really good brenford IPS neither of these are great defenses Spurs bad Defense United Forest yeah yeah although I would say you could probably go earlier on one of the brf players because the fixture this week is bad on paper but Spurs away come on definitely scoring in that so yeah if you go I I think you can only really go with buo because as of now that's all the info we have uh e losing pens I mean let's assume he never takes another one again does that make him bad or he's still okay I he still has decent fixure so we say said it earlier um I it maybe two game weeks back that is this just a top of play you got to be patient with the points will take over throughout the season you know Assist here assist there kind of thing doesn't haul as much as you would like I think especially um what was it was he had a few hauls towards the end of last season that kind of shifts people's perspective on him but generally he's a player that takes over and not a real high ceiling type of player I guess and at 6.9 million I mean what are you expecting right you're happy with a goal every other week an assist here or there yeah and we all agree he's been unlucky so far so a matter of being patient um premiums maybe we sidebar the premiums before before we go to Captain C uh what has this week you know done to your thinking Palmer Saka so Saka returned again with bonus um because Spurs can't defend corners and um Co Palmer and everybody's getting cold feet people have cold pal so you ah so talk to me I will talk to you sa um first of all I'm very happy about Saka I think we Vindicated those who who you know kept the faith I brought him in on a wild cut because I think Saka is just top player who can who can score against anyone return about just about against anyone and you know his nail he plays every he's consistent so you just keep it in for for long term right Saka is fine now Cole bmer that does seem to be an issue he is really expensive I have someone who I am quite keen on although it is a bit risky it's cheaper than C so feel for then can I interest you in a field for then now that kdb is injured although we don't know the extent of the injury yet but he did come off injured in the last night's Champions League game by the way for those of you who are listening we are recording this on Thursday morning morning so we haven't seen the last round of Champions League games for all I know Saka could get injured tonight hopefully not Saka made of adaman made you you don't need to worry he he'll limp off he'll be stretched off he'll start on Sunday okay but yeah yeah but just just a disclaimer there you know the advice might come before any late injury news and things like that but yeah kdb went off injured field foran down to 9.33 I went early on foran was really bad decision but perhaps now is the time although although you know it's probably one of their worst fixtures in the entire um calendar right when they play against Arsenal the only team that seems to be able to consistently stop them from scoring they didn't score against Arsenal right in two games last season didn't didn't score in two games last season Arsenal have rise back and you saw everything from the Spur game Arsenal are coming here to defend like they will take a nil nil happily and walk off uh ARA doesn't care right so I mean this is not arguably not I mean let say on wild card this week I suspect this is not how you're going to use your free transfer and also Sam not to not to dampen the mood for Forin but the thing is that he's kind of competing with Savio in my view anyway on the right wing and I don't think the kdb injury yes it influences it in the sense that foran's the next best creative outlet but I would think that gundan is the one who comes in for kdb now both of them came out at halftime against inter so this doesn't really help us in trying to figure it out but my feeling is it's gundo for kdb Savio out for fan and sure Fen should start more he's the second best player but I'm still not confident enough to go there kind of want to you know let let pep figure this out before I go there yeah yeah I think that's fair you know you could wait one week and then next week when they play you know in their fixtures they have a really nice fixture run um Newcastle fham wolves southton bonou so you could see who starts this week in in you know KB's place and then move next week yeah just something look out on yeah and I think game six is a good fixture Newcastle have looked really bad so far the the position in the table is very a very inaccurate reflection of their performances very very lucky in all these games especially against wolves no right to win that game all right then I don't who set up the only other premium option is Salah right who you not going to sell Salah so we're solid right I mean we that blank changes nothing for me I assume it changes nothing for you no still captaining him this week I think I was going to come to Captain C let's talk about it now so Captain this week Salah not even a debate you have Watkins I'm surprised you're not tempted I am tempted I am tempted by Watkins Captain it would be between the two yeah if you have harand okay let me ask ask you this question for harand owners do you keep the faith or do you you know chicken out because it's a really hard fixture the hardest fixture that City would play the only way you Captain harand this week is if you don't have Salan who don't have Watkins then I can understand it that's acceptable even though it's a bad fixture Holland still I mean I can show it to you now we have some stuff here which I you know so much Vibes I didn't feel the need to go through all this so we have goal scorer odds on the screen uh Holland second to Salah I think Holland's this kind of charts Holland's always going to be near the top he's just inevitable so but for the first time he's not top I think this is not top but it tells you what it takes right it's the hardest fixture in the season and he's only second like he's it doesn't push him down that much so if you didn't have Salah Watkins sure I'd consider Holland but for me it's Salah all day long in that case I'll go Watkins if everyone's going to Captain Salah I'm going Watkins I liked how but I needed to push it I mean if that's the case Sam you should go down to V right I mean he's on this chot too I don't have V SAA you really want to be differential no I think I think Watkins is a good differential cuz not many people went on him and I think with Pedro's injury not many people can go to him even if they wanted to this week is that relevant to a captaincy decision Sam no not getable someone is or how it's relevant to the Vibes you get when when your captaincy pays off compared to what everyone else captained okay so basically X XS which is X spice you know Salah X less than Watkins very low very low this week because everyone will probably kep Salah so the spice is with Watkins this week everyone so if you were talking like nandos Holland would be like lemon and Herb or something like that yeah mild yeah no you actually I would say this week he would be a bit spicier because no one's going to Captain him and if he ends up hauling yeah it's good but I I always feel the spiciest pics are the ones that people don't even have because a lot of people have Salah and harand now if you captain harand and he outscores Salah great but it's not that big of a difference because people already have him um whereas Watkins if you Captain someone who no one has that is when you get the ultimate spice extra hot what's what Saka Saka has a Nando sauce right Saka does have a Nando sauce I I I should also be caution you that nandos is quite a niche reference okay like it works for us and maybe some UK people if you're like from America you have no idea what we're talking about do they not have nandos in America no they don't I'm pretty sure they don't no they don't I'm pretty sure I saw an episode I think an interview with like Bradley Cooper and I think Sienna Miller and she was talking about nandos he was like what is nandos and she was like it's it's sort of like chicken and I it is chicken not not sort of it is hopefully it is chicken uh okay spicy sauce basically spicy sauce um yeah yeah we said no product placement we've given at least five minutes or Nando so let's let's yeah someone contact Mand and you know yeah hook us up so Watkins cap for you Sam based on X spies I I love it I think it's a it's a decent play uh yeah I'm I'm on Salah I'm boring so yeah I think that's us for this week we will we've kept it short but we'll see you next week in the meantime yeah good hit your green arrows guys um like subscribe do all the stuff you know support we appreciate all your support and we'll see you next week yeah know treat this like drugs you know you know a friend push it on to them push it on to someone else uh we here we have Good Vibes and decent insights I mean I I'll take one of those things so yeah a,7354,i think i think walkins is a good differential cuz not many people went on him and i think with pedros injury not many people can go to him even if they wanted to this week is that relevant to a captaincy decision sam no its not getable someone is or how its relevant to the vibes you get when your captaincy pays off compared to what everyone else captain this a thing hello everyone and welcome back to the fbl banger show my name is civa im joined by sam game week five coming in sam and as a non holland owner sam you must have had a fun weekend whos holland never heard of that name before no idea who are you referring to s so how is fpl moneyball working sam how is it going rebuilding harand in the aggregate hows that going what its its its annoying cu i looked at my team last week right and i got quite a few picks that returned so i was happy like i got watkins right which was great watkins i brought in saka despite the socall bad fixure still return quite happy with that gacho didnt start but still return happy with that and then i look at other people who like their whole team blanked except for harland and the captain harland and they matching my points so thats the reality of f money ball but well lets keep going if i had my captain c right so i think that was the only thing they say because i captain salah and he blanked who would have thought might couldnt beat the mighty forest but if the captain c got right then i think i would be be doing decently but thats what we said right sam if you recall we talked about value of holland boring captain probably good for a goal or two and i think you just consider yourself lucky it wasnt a hattrick and i was right a bad i told everyone that he couldnt keep it up and he had a whole 33 drop in goals per game so and if you count champions league thats like i dont know whats the percentage but hes finished right blanking against inter finished he washed everyone sand peps gonna sub him off halftime he already said this week pep did say im going to make two subs every half time this is the new pep if it was at half r lewis r lewis off at half time thats thats thats a good question sam lets just talk about r lewis lets just get straight into it right so we both are proud owners of rico lewis and have spent weeks telling other people to get him in while weve enjoyed his points and so everyone joined in this week and are very angry at us for saying ric le is a good pick and everyones immediately talking we got to sell him now but this to me this was all part of the plan right this is there was a risk we knew going in no i agree i agree a 45 city player doesnt come often right city starter so we are always prepared for the fact that he might lose his place somewhere in the near future and we just going of enjoy the points while we still can and once hes hes dropped he loses his place then he goes out 45 46 now you can easily trade it to anyone loads of players that you options loads of options out there you think hes lost his place i dont think so not yet but will he keep it what im saying is that the potential outweighs the risk so even if he loses his place its not like he are spending six m on the play like that its its a easy transfer out or you can just bench him like its 46 doesnt make a big difference thats why im saying its worth taking that risk i was never planning on playing him against arsenal anyway so maybe ive i think the issues people are having is a lot of people have who have rico lewis seem to have decided that hes their third defender and they have two unplayable people like howard bellis and stuff on the bench thats thats a problem but we told you that going in you always have bench cover for him but hes still i think a decent pick even in the inter game which is last night hes playing second striker at certain points like hes just so high up played the full 90 you can look at that good or bad why is he playing champions league but you could look at it as hes part of their best team and so pep is playing him in the hard games i think again i would just play him until the benchings become more of a problem i agree 100 okay so thats thats rico lewis done very good lets talk about jao pedro s because in a week where a lot of things went wrong i think the first sign that this was going to be a bad week was when what is it 300 uk time brighton lineup comes out jedro not even in the squad and fabian herzler the brighton manager has hes only been here three weeks hes younger than both of us and hes already bald 31 year old man already bald said nothing in the press conference right he said he just said js coming back well see how it goes suddenly hes got a knock and hes gone hes vanished not the squad for the premier league game not in the squad for carabal cup last night so j pedro immediate sell right plus i think brighton only has one more good fixture before his starts to turn home game against forest which is that even a good fixture because forest has been pretty impressive that this start of the season they have it they have it honestly but after that chelsea spurs newcastle wolves home and then liverpool city thats a nightmare run so unless i think you have two options either you sell or he just sits on your bench at 5 point what say 56 5 point somewhere around seven depending on when went in okay 57 hes still a good how do i put it if you have more pressing issues you can just leave him on the bench but i think the problem is a lot of you guys went with harand salah trend loaded up on premium so youre dependent on jiao fedro starting and that is your issue right now which maybe is a warning in future know do not put a 55 forward as your starting player with no bench cover at all again see i feel like we did say all these things i for example have ja pedro but ive got a full playing bench but im seeing a lot of people with langer chi jebon these are all these names are making up theyre real people mahoney bunch of nonplaying 45 forwards and of course youre scared now because youre down to jao pedro he doesnt play and youre youre screwed so cuz also price out of making a step up to another striker that stops so for those who have been careful enough to keep some cash in the bank and also to be fair alexander isak right we should probably go up in budget and talk about alexander isak who this week what came off at halftime because blurry vision or couldnt see or looked at his points on fpl and just like my eyes and didnt appear for the second so what are you doing if because alexander isak is a very easy question to answer suppose youve got budget to go anywhere where do you go i have isak so i am thinking is he is he confirmed out this week but he wasnt in training yesterday okay were recording thursday early morning lets assume he doesnt make it what do you do i have a few forwards on my short list because i have to make that transfer if it doesnt start the annoy l a lot of the fixtures only start the turn in game week six so i think one of the prime transfers in i would go maybe is harvards back to harvard because arsenal has this nice run game week six onwards but then he has that city fixture this week other than that unfortunately wia is out because i think i would have loved to go for visa but now hes confirmed out for what is it two months something like that a pretty longterm injury i know thats a lot s go so on wha being out lets just quickly sidebar to branford a bit a lot of its not forwards but i it does influence especially if you got jao pedro you cant move branfords got two very cheap midfield options now kevin sharder 55m and fabio cavalo is 48 now is he a forward so theyre both midfield this but i think its relevant because a lot of people will definitely be looking at brenford i personally feel its spurs is an okay fixture i dont mind it as a fixture but i think its too early to go in because we dont know if sha plays or cavalo plays and to be fair i dont think even thomas frank knows because natural replacement would be kevin sharda but cavalo played so well midweek a goal and two assists it seems harsh to just not play him at all and they paid so much money for him as well but surely umo will be the number one brenford pick to have and you could argue youre looking at two assets individually by doubling up but do you want to use two midfield slots on brandfit so wia would have been perfect i think but unfortunate for the injury other than that i know i know saa i know where youre hitting with this are you going to suggest dcl okay yes so come back to okay so back to forwards well dcl okay there are two hype every week theres a hyp pick right last week it was j pedro we saw how that turned out so this week the hype picks everyones talking about it the bandwagons are dcl and jamie v what i dont know maybe weve gone back in time like five years ago but lets talk about dcl and to be fair everton despite sucking very bad they are scoring goals are they two goals against they took the lead thats true that is true and even in game week one they were i would say very unfortunate not to get a penalty dcl was fouled by lewis dunk but didnt get the penalty he cheap hes nailed hes on pens hes 59m and this fixture run looks very decent no everton play lester and palace i swi fulham southampton the next five next six probably just overthinking this right if you dont go for him maybe but thats also that i dont know i just dont trust everton right now leester i switch southampton those are fellow relegation candidates so those might be good nice games for them the others could be a bit tough but again like you said they are still scoring they just cant seem to hold on to their leads so maybe and if they cant hold on to the league need to score more goals see thats true that is true maybe i would definitely prefer dcl over vadi and because everton just is a slightly better team than leester i think below six below six mill this is probably your best option if thats as far as your budget can go i think the concern with vardy is that game week six feels like a blank right theyre playing arsenal and so thats what puts me off vardy i get that hes a tempting onewe option if youre on wild card game mi six you get the everton home fixture this and youre done but gaming six against arsenal is tough and also jamie vard lets this is maybe this is the problem about reading stats and stuff like he scored from one shot this week if im not mistaken hes taken three shots this season and scored from two i remember seeing that somewhere on twitter i could be wrong but i he scores with i dont know is that is that mon on his fe finishing or is it he youre right regression two goal three shots two goals thats insane is this a massive over performance or is this the rate hes gonna hes gonna go i dont know i think theres just too much risk to go dcl if you had to pick one between the two i would go d although im just going to try it in there that chriswood is only 61 so if you can stretch for chris wood he might be a good sleeper pick because they have decent fixtures brighton fulham chelsea palace leicester west ham newcastle so i would say only starts to turn in game week 10 so after west ham game they got newcastle arsenal is switch city united villa so thats when you maybe want to get off but for the next few weeks forest maybe lets lets not talk about sleeper we leave the other 10 20 fpl podcast to discuss that but back on okay chris wood chris wood versus detail now that feels like a debate i can get into because im not sold on vard and youre not sold on vardy and to perhaps explain why im not so of apart from the fact that hes only had three shots i just feel steve cooper leester very defensive team in fact if you follow a lot of leester fan channels and leester podcasts theyre all quite frustrated with cooper because he plays defensive football theyve started playing wilfred and dei as a number 10 for those who dont know ind is a dm but hes playing him as a number 10 because he wants that many defenders on the pitch thats his focus and so i feel like vs just g to struggle to keep this up as good a striker as he is and so for me its dcl in wood i the only thing that puts wood off is when you look at the fixtures like we have them on the screen it feels hard right brighton chelsea in that in the next three but maybe i need to stop looking at these colors right cuz forest have been good and they beat liverpool they did they look tight and it looks like they just scor one goal a game which is what they have done one1 in the first game the b s enter one nil then another one1 against wolves and one nil against liverpool so they just score one goal a game but well wood scored two of those and in each time he scored three bonus points 61 i think its a tempting pick i will go for wood this is hard man this is hard because chris wood feels like a pick that no ones going for this week which thats what makes it tempting whereas it does wetting your appetite for some chris wood this is a hard decision to make man i dont want to go i dont want to take the software out and just go with dcl although thats it i think if you have the budget for it watkins would probably be the best forward pick of all if he plays 60 minutes but doesnt matter he still scoring and i think he did come out and say that it was just like a precautionary sub which sounds good means that he should be okay for the weekend home game against wol is witch united willam bonm good fixtures if you got the budget to go up to watkins even via two transfers i think thats like a nobrainer this week because game week five is a tough week the best fixtures are generally amongst the bad teams like south af play zips which you dont want anybody from either side pretty much my transfer strategy now is just lets see who is playing south anon this but unfortunately i dont want to bring in any isr players as well so this weeks a bit tougher to be fair i did consider liam dap quite a bit because again sounds very spicy but also i just thought southampton anybody can score against them but dap came off on 58 minutes this week and from what i read kieran mckenna the yip switch guy he likes to make a lot of attacking subs on 60 minutes apparently he did this a lot in the championship and hes now got a full set of forwards and midfielders who he can bring on so if thats going to keep happening then no i dont i dont want weve already seen with j this is starting to annoy me i dont need more players who dont play 90 minutes i agree i agree so okay chris the choice is between wood and dcl for us pretty much wood and dcl danny wck still not convincing you im guessing and to be evan ferguson is back now and thats a problem which ja pedro issues get worse and worse and by the way brightons fixtures turn in game six onward so i wouldnt bring in unless youre planning to walk out in game six so its just a one we punt to use up a full transfer not on a brighton player palace and united id like to talk to you a bit and also spurs right because they have three strikers who all of whom i would say for minutes lets start with palace because thats the most people who had points this week would have got it either from watkins or mateta so who has mata people who had him g one some i had him in some of my drafts and then i dropped him because i was worried about olympics and stuff and he did come back quite late but we saw matel this week two goals took the pen away from it walked up to him and said no man its mine are you worried with in they both played 90 minutes the last the last weekend but it seems like mata is the main man still right nailed plays up front i think an had to play off the wing matas on pant he tucks his shirt in hes a french guy wearing the number 14 these are hes been working with andre over the summer clearly thinks hes above palaces level thats why hes telling a that hes not taking pens these fixtures are hard to read though and hes quite a high price for the fixtures that he has he is quite expensive i would say 75 ina could be a tempting option if he i dont know well he keep playing 90 every week alongside mata he played in the midweek and both to fair did both of them sc no mata came off around 60 and k played i think the full game scored a scored and assisted of course a only does these things in cup games so i dont i think of all the budget forward options my number one pick would be chriswood okay so still the safe guy amongst all these picks i just want to ask you dominic sanki weve gone completely cold on him is that because spurs were outclassed by arsenal because they have much easier fixtures now but i think just on a whole i would like to wait a little bit on solan the injury took some time off that would have been useful for him to integrate into the squad get some games together with the rest of the team so i would like to wait and see for salan i think hes he priced attractively but for someone who is just totally coming in new to the new team i think its a wait and see for me and to be fair spurs were bad last night in the cup against commentary they were losing until like 88 minutes and then they scored two last minute goals soan it come off by then so it doesnt doesnt bard well this looks like a team thats still figuring itself out lot of possession but not a lot of end results just yet and we also dont know whos on pence so if its not so lanky then that doesnt make him as interesting i think zi are you are still on z like i still positively you still see him in a positive light this well keep this short because im the only person in the universe who owns him right just me and one other guy from work so i think its one of those i was hoping to come on the show triumphantly i have been the only guy to get the hall anybody who watched that match will tell you that ive been robbed right he should have had a hatrick okay more to have should have had a hatrick almost every single game we play so maybe i found the dutch dwin unz maybe i dont know its early days what i will say is that he was very attacking played the full 90 so in a game where they won 30 he had the most xg i feel like at some point one of these has to go in im okay to hold i think what is most positive about their performance was that he was crucial to their linkup play so he yes he didnt score but he gave so much in the linkup and the buildup play that means hes safe for the next few games uniteds a very weird team to read like nobody knows you should be positive or negative about them but i always thought the next two fixtures were fine palace and spurs these are not great defenses and to be fair i dont think villa brenford west ham chelsea none of these are defenses i fear so happy to hold for now but im not recommending him as a buy that was just for me going against the southampton game take a shot you see you miss all the shots you dont take i went for gacho he didnt start but i was also right in which he is uniteds best attacking player we both right at the same time it balanced out so i didnt get a hall but i got a nice decent six points just im happy with it no complain talk about being robbed me i told you gacha wouldnt start i was so confident and you still ended up with the better outcome but fair play man fair play it was a good goal i dont know though is he going to start soon he should but at the same time rashford did he scor as well and that midweek game in which they won like 20 what was it no n nil seven n right seven n sorry confusing it with the bayern game seven nil yes gacho had two goals and two assists something like that so rashford played up top rashford play up top and scor but again its a team two divisions lower so i dont know how much we can read into the game but good for their confidence lets see how it goes what if zi gets dropped this week rashs up front gatos on the left could be a possibility im not fortunately for you im not worried no zi starts i think the fact that he didnt start midweek is good because well depends how you want to look at it right like rico lewis played full 90 midweek thats good because pep trust him ja pedro didnt play thats good because they want to keep him for the weekend zi came on midweek thats good because they had keep him fresh so its tough we are just making guesses to what the manager is thinking that mean thats thats this game entirely press conference is absolute waste of time but lets lets talk about united lets lets keep this rolling because moving into midfield right i think weve covered the forwards all the options that you can consider lets move into midfield because jot is becoming a problem now and even luis diaz right didnt start midweek gapo started and had his best per performance this season rashford are you mildly interested 7 mil cheap but moving to rashford no im not im not there are lots of players i would like but like i mentioned earlier its a bit annoying that a lot of their fixtures only turn in game week six like i think if you dont have an arsenal player saka would definitely be a big buy next week a brenford fielder buo possibly one of the others as well would be a great buy next week annoying thing is that this week this week is its hard to find a player for this week who whose fixture starts turning this week im going to give you one he is a very attacking midfielder who returned this week hes nailed hes got some set pieces hes cheap hes english he is im gonna guess im gonna guess smith r no i i love smith r but no f pictures are hard this is a guy who plays 90 minutes sam and he plays for a very unfashionable team dwight mcneel there you go dwight mcneel what are you serious hey lets lets not knock it wa double digit hall this week i think thats thats his quot for the year so you missed it thats it wait for next season but d mcneel does very well on all these youre going to scoff right but all these models and predictions and stuff he scores highly okay hes returned two weeks in a row and he now has a set of fairly reasonable fixtures right everton fixtures look good and i think well all agree that everton have been undone by their defense right but we dont care about that do we because if the attackers are returning the attackers are returning and hes 54m nailed on 90 minutes how many 55 millimes do you have who are nailed for 90 minutes even smith can make it what about onana he cant keep the submit surely this i feel bad because ive told like casual friends you dont buy anana hes never going to score again and he just keeps like scoring these bangers and headers and stuff but no real talk i dont see onana being sustainable in terms thats a thats like picking k mate thats not going to work or like pink picking gundogan or some something like that s no lets not dont insult me okay gund and k and hanana different levels okay but no coming back d manil you didnt even give me a fair shake midfielder if dcl is in your options why isnt dwight mcneel in your consideration it just feels wrong dont get me wrong i like dght mcneil i think from a few seasons back as well like hes always been that hardworking one of the few or only creative player that everton has so a lot of the burden falls on him but i will go for d over d mcil i think however if and i feel there are just better options in the midfield slot that you can go for name them there arent that many especially at that price no at 55 ahmad dio also not nailed if youre worried about gacho youre also worried about ahmad but g has this ability to score even off the bench so thats why im im a bit less with about g so doesnt address the question right maybe you can move up what about soo slide who has had two assist this season points ticking in but 65 not that much and he plays 90 every week he is nil unlike j unlike di its an option what he did go midweek right so its its an option but its its a boring option youre going to get assist youre going to be frustrated some games because he gets the assist before the assist one of those options that will take over if you if you have strong knes not to transfer him out over the cost of many games i think the points could tick i think it comes back to your initial point which is gamei five just sucks right and you want to wait till 6 and maybe get some meno or get the brandford guy who will play if you cant get to embo you could even work your way up ill ill give an option see i like that is a bit above the five6 price bracket but i like jared bowen 75 so a bit pricey but has been good hes wr three weeks in a row by the way no ones talking about it goal against palace assist against city assist against fulham and i dont know the fixtures doesnt look good on paper like right here if youre if youre watching the video you would see westmer smack in the middle but chelsea at home they can score brenford probably score if switch spurs you can definitely score united at home definitely scoreable so i think from an attacking point of view i like bow in fact im i think im convincing myself to get ven in this week chelseas i think chelsea fortunate against bouth and again so much of this is narrative based right if evan nson can take a better penalty chelsea probably lose that game and everything changes but because he missed were talking about chelsea as if theyre tough team to beat so dont mind it j bowen at home and then after that fixtures look good brenford ips neither of these are great defenses spurs bad defense united forest although i would say you could probably go earlier on one of the brf players because the fixture this week is bad on paper but spurs away come on definitely scoring in that so if you go i think you can only go with buo because as of now thats all the info we have e losing pens lets assume he never takes another one again does that make him bad or hes still okay i he still has decent fixure so we say said it earlier i it maybe two game weeks back that is this just a top of play you got to be patient with the points will take over throughout the season assist here assist there thing doesnt haul as much as you would like i think especially what was it was he had a few hauls towards the end of last season that shifts peoples perspective on him but generally hes a player that takes over and not a real high ceiling type of player and at 69m what are you expecting right youre happy with a goal every other week an assist here or there and we all agree hes been unlucky so far so a matter of being patient premiums maybe we sidebar the premiums before we go to captain c what has this week done to your thinking palmer saka so saka returned again with bonus because spurs cant defend corners and co palmer and everybodys getting cold feet people have cold pal so you ah so talk to me i will talk to you sa first of all im very happy about saka i think we vindicated those who kept the faith i brought him in on a wild cut because i think saka is just top player who can who can score against anyone return about just about against anyone and his nail he plays every hes consistent so you just keep it in for long term right saka is fine now cole bmer that does seem to be an issue he is expensive i have someone who i am quite keen on although it is a bit risky its cheaper than c so feel for then can i interest you in a field for then now that kdb is injured although we dont know the extent of the injury yet but he did come off injured in the last nights champions league game by the way for those of you who are listening we are recording this on thursday morning so we havent seen the last round of champions league games for all i know saka could get injured tonight hopefully not saka made of adaman made you dont need to worry hell limp off hell be stretched off hell start on sunday okay but but just a disclaimer there the advice might come before any late injury news and things like that but kdb went off injured field foran down to 933 i went early on foran was bad decision but perhaps now is the time although its probably one of their worst fixtures in the entire calendar right when they play against arsenal the only team that seems to be able to consistently stop them from scoring they didnt score against arsenal right in two games last season didnt didnt score in two games last season arsenal have rise back and you saw everything from the spur game arsenal are coming here to defend like they will take a nil happily and walk off ara doesnt care right so this is not arguably not let say on wild card this week i suspect this is not how youre going to use your free transfer and also sam not to not to dampen the mood for forin but the thing is that hes competing with savio in my view anyway on the right wing and i dont think the kdb injury yes it influences it in the sense that forans the next best creative outlet but i would think that gundan is the one who comes in for kdb now both of them came out at halftime against inter so this doesnt help us in trying to figure it out but my feeling is its gundo for kdb savio out for fan and sure fen should start more hes the second best player but im still not confident enough to go there want to let pep figure this out before i go there i think thats fair you could wait one week and then next week when they play in their fixtures they have a nice fixture run newcastle fham wolves southton bonou so you could see who starts this week in kbs place and then move next week just something look out on and i think game six is a good fixture newcastle have looked bad so far the position in the table is very a very inaccurate reflection of their performances very lucky in all these games especially against wolves no right to win that game all right then i dont who set up the only other premium option is salah right who you not going to sell salah so were solid right we that blank changes nothing for me i assume it changes nothing for you no still captaining him this week i think i was going to come to captain c lets talk about it now so captain this week salah not even a debate you have watkins im surprised youre not tempted i am tempted i am tempted by watkins captain it would be between the two if you have harand okay let me ask you this question for harand owners do you keep the faith or do you chicken out because its a hard fixture the hardest fixture that city would play the only way you captain harand this week is if you dont have salan who dont have watkins then i can understand it thats acceptable even though its a bad fixture holland still i can show it to you now we have some stuff here which i so much vibes i didnt feel the need to go through all this so we have goal scorer odds on the screen holland second to salah i think hollands this charts hollands always going to be near the top hes just inevitable so but for the first time hes not top i think this is not top but it tells you what it takes right its the hardest fixture in the season and hes only second like hes it doesnt push him down that much so if you didnt have salah watkins sure id consider holland but for me its salah all day long in that case ill go watkins if everyones going to captain salah im going watkins i liked how but i needed to push it if thats the case sam you should go down to v right hes on this chot too i dont have v saa you want to be differential no i think i think watkins is a good differential cuz not many people went on him and i think with pedros injury not many people can go to him even if they wanted to this week is that relevant to a captaincy decision sam no not getable someone is or how its relevant to the vibes you get when your captaincy pays off compared to what everyone else captained okay so x xs which is x spice salah x less than watkins very low very low this week because everyone will probably kep salah so the spice is with watkins this week everyone so if you were talking like nandos holland would be like lemon and herb like that mild no you i would say this week he would be a bit spicier because no ones going to captain him and if he ends up hauling its good but i always feel the spiciest pics are the ones that people dont even have because a lot of people have salah and harand now if you captain harand and he outscores salah great but its not that big of a difference because people already have him whereas watkins if you captain someone who no one has that is when you get the ultimate spice extra hot whats what saka has a nando sauce right saka does have a nando sauce i should also be caution you that nandos is quite a niche reference okay like it works for us and maybe some uk people if youre like from america you have no idea what were talking about do they not have nandos in america no they dont im pretty sure they dont no they dont im pretty sure i saw an episode i think an interview with like bradley cooper and i think sienna miller and she was talking about nandos he was like what is nandos and she was like its its like chicken and i it is chicken not it is hopefully it is chicken okay spicy sauce spicy sauce we said no product placement weve given at least five minutes or nando so lets lets someone contact mand and hook us up so watkins cap for you sam based on x spies i love it i think its a its a decent play im im on salah im boring so i think thats us for this week we will weve kept it short but well see you next week in the meantime good hit your green arrows guys like subscribe do all the stuff support we appreciate all your support and well see you next week know treat this like drugs a friend push it on to them push it on to someone else we here we have good vibes and decent insights ill take one of those things so a,6786

I'm sure you're you know desperate to talk I can't see it as sorry that's far too fuzzy I can't make it out you panic me then for a second2 points de oh I read for it Ry nine points thank God for Rya Trent one coner one Lewis one Robinson 2 um yeah I know it's w all over again sacka 7 Rogers 2 E2 is my transfer in for for Smith row who obviously did better than eza uh Salah with the fail uh the captain SE on four son two isak one off at half time of course so a lot of teams were popped up by Harland um I don't have Harland so I couldn't be popped up by that Salah blanked for the first time this season so what are you going to get when harand returns and Salah blanks and you haven't got Harland you're going to get a bad game week um luckily you know sacka and reyer came in for me I yeah I know I mean and there were a lot of teams who had like the 26 points from Harland and then blanks everywhere else wasn't there um there were some crazy looking teams this week in that respect and yeah why why did so many players blank it was just it was just a very very odd game week in that respect and obviously Harland papered over the cracks for a lot of managers I watched the forest Liverpool game live don't ask me how because I wasn't there I did turn down a ticket to go as well this is terrible what would you do in my shoes here so I had a friend who I met at Forest text me on Friday night and he said if I can get you a ticket do you want one and I thought to myself well I'm going to Brighton next week this week and I'm going to Fulham the week after I can't really go into pip and say what do you think can I go to Liverpool and then go next week to the Brighton game and then the week after the full I thought she's not going to let me go to three games and I thought to myself you know what's the chances of us getting some at Liverpool it'd be a good nice to go up there and that I thought no so I DM him back said thanks for the offer but I better not I better do family stuff better not push my luck what happens uh the best away day in the history of I mean like there were people on the forest Focus pod that I do share with saying yeah the best a day in memory and I'm like oh my God so what would you do would you go into pip and look at that look at the sacrifice I made I could have gone but I didn't even ask you cuz that's the kind of guy I am or should I just forget it and leave it or should I bring it up in an argument in a few years time what you Mark I know I know you and I know how much pit puts up with with you I would I would strongly advise you do abs answer I wanted that is I thought I thought I deserve credit for that but I'm getting no credit and I've missed the best away day in Forest history the thing is imagine if You' taken it and got all the way up there and then you got thrash 3-0 yeah but yeah that was the more pretty big gamble it was and as big as going without harand and cin C in the first place anyway yes so um luckily I got through the weekend boyed by the uh the victory at anfield and then it started to sink in as the hours passed that obviously i' had a miserable game week but you know there were teams there were teams worse off than mine um and I've just got to take it but but now I mean what what I'm more down about is the way it's going in the you know we've got Palmer who struggled we've got sackos now got odard missing for probably a long time based on what we heard tonight is that doesn't sound great so we've got to assess is sacka GNA be the sacker of last season now with oard missing for a long period of time probably not we're still G to get him for the two home games but after that you know how long what's the impact of the odard injury on sacka um Watkins has done okay showed up last week so he could be an option but Palmer sacka son I don't see them I don't see them justifying their price at the moment um and I fear I thought sacka would but I wonder now so I'm fear that what we're ending up with even though we started the season going oh there's so much Choice there dilemas and everyone's got different teams I Fe we're going to end up with Salah and Harland in all our teams two Defenders and a load of four FES I do worry I do worry yeah do you not think that's the way it's going to go I'm not as I'm not as worried as about that because I think we're we're seeing in game week six we're going to see people getting rid of Salah um and yeah for the sacker home games yeah and so what you think that in game week eight people are gonna go back to Salah again I don't think I don't know and I think if you've got two Arsenal Defenders and Trent and Harland you're going to find it you know a bit different because we're looking at Players like boo yeah you can't do that yeah as well yeah I don't know I think it's I I I think we are I think game week six is going to be interesting because I think we're going to see people move towards a lot of the same teams I think everyone's team is going to be very similar in game week six and game we seven yeah there's going to be a few people that because I can't I can't have sacka and Salah for example game week six I don't think many can so well you can't your wild card to that you can probably walk to it what a harand sacka Salah and Trent and well you can't have two AR Defenders as well no you can't have two AR Defenders as well no so you'd have to have but you can wild card to saaka Salah Trent and Harland I've tried it I've looked you can I don't think I'm gonna be going with Salah from from game week I'm gonna wild card in either six or seven and I'd be surprised if my team ended up with seller in it so no it won't then but I think what will happen is we'll get sacka in for for the two home games and then we'll start to see that Arsenal perhaps a much more defensive team rather than a Forward Thinking Team without odard and we'll start to think or maybe we don't need sacka maybe we go have it up top and that covers Arsenal I just fear that the options that we yeah we were really giddy about oh yeah this looks amazing harland's 15 million so not everyone's goingon to get him well that's going to go pair shaped and we've got other options like Palmer and sacka and son and and Watkins and and and you can't have them all but I think already I feel like the pool is narrowing a bit what we need what we need is Palmer to start pulling his finger out right that that will that will cure it but I don't know I watched Chelsea and I think um I I don't see it happening do you see it happening yet I mean well I mean on the on the big screen is the is the is the is the fixtures so the long the longterm view so let's assume I mean game week six is going to be split a lot of people won't want to sell Salah for wolves away but some people might have they W I think yeah that might help yeah yeah um and then Liverpool have Crystal Palace Chelsea Arsenal Brighton Aston Villa then it's Southampton in 12 but then it's straight into Man City and then Newcastle away I don't think people are going to be moving back to Salah for that run yeah I mean the only thing um because this is the other thing that's going to be D is if people don't move back to Salah because they just go well I'm only going to captain harand now and that's the I mean how close are we to that I mean after four weeks we're going to look at harand start I mean it's Absolut ridiculous after four weeks how close are we to perac cat in Harland do you think I mean we're not going to get it this week because he's at Arsenal but then I reckon even Newcastle way I think we're going to get people going yeah I'd rather Captain Harland than captain sacka at home um so I think even then we're going to get question marks over do you do you not captain in Harland even when saca's got Plum fixtures so I mean right I me man City's fixures from six and Newcastle Fulham wolf Southampton Bournemouth Brighton Tottenham you're going to cap him in all of those I imagine unless you go for the sacker option at Leicester and Southampton but yeah then you're not and then it's Liverpool away in 13 but that's Salah and Harlem I know I know Arsenal got West Ham away I mean Spurs have got Fulham at home that week so a son or salanki possibly son really I mean I just I I don't know son out wide to me I mean I own him and I you know from what I've seen he obviously got me a couple of goals in game week two but I I don't really see him justifying that P St at the moment we'll see he might surprise us at home to brenford playing out wide but we know out wide he's not as effective as an asset I just think that already I feel because harland's just been ridiculous incredible right and we all thought 15 million was a price tag to make people think well it probably isn't anymore is it it's not I mean like he's 15 what he's three now and no one's going to Blink at that so that's a shame straight away because obviously he's been going to come the dominant heavy hitter and he's going to become the Perma captain and so those two things straight away are going to start narrowing the difference between teams and then yeah it'll be whether or not you feel like having Salah can you justify if you don't Captain him or do you go sacka but I worry about the odard impact on sacka what we need yeah is Palmer and son to kind of show that they can be justified at 10 million and we need foden back to kind of at least present some alternative to Harlem we haven't got that so it's not been I mean fbl did all they could with the pricing don't get me wrong I think they did well with that but unfortunately the way the season has started it hasn't lent itself to everyone having different teams yet I think it's kind of pushing people towards well you've got to have Harland you might as well catch them every week There's question marks over having Sal if you don't Captain him question marks over sacka Palmer's not ready son's not good enough foden's not in the team you know that suddenly the pool is Contracting it's like oh that's not what I expected not what I wanted so it's annoying me a little bit it's kind of the other way around to what we were expecting because we thought maybe with with Palmer and sacka competing with each other it would give you the option but actually they're not competing with Harland and Salah at the moment so why would you go there what we actually need at the moment is is for Palmer sa to be competing with like Lis Diaz and you know th those types of players because they're the ones where we're we're kind of moving around Salah and Har at the moment going anywhere foden's the big one I think when come back and start hitting anywhere near the form he showed last season I think that's when people might yeah but he's not in the starting lineup tonight again is he you know I I thought he might be saved for Europe but no I mean the other thing is you know we need harand to stop scoring loads of goals [Music] but yeah well here's anyway here my team I'm a lot less um grumpy than than you are had a okay week uh 59 points for me Henderson in goal porro Robinson and Trent I mean that was a disaster um Robinson conceding to a 95th minute Danny in equalizer is just absolute Peak FPL I bought in Salah and Pedro Pedro didn't play Salah blanked uh I got Smith row Off the Bench though and I tell you what I was worried going into Sunday because I sold esack and sacka and when sacka got that assist and I still had ESAT left I thought I could be on the back of about a 20 25 Point swing here but actually with with with Smith coming off my bench I was about I was one point up on on that move so one point up were you I thought you were still down on it okay yeah because ISAC only got the one point didn't he yeah he hea with the one um sacka with seven Smith row matched him and then Sal with two yeah I mean it's crazy is it look at your team right they I mean obvious got Mata but you only got two players a turn Mata and Smith row and Smith row was on your bench so it's was like so many teams just had either Harland and one return or that's about it it was I mea I mean obviously was a big differential for you so well done but um took over as well luy lucky that that happened cuz penalty in the in the 9th minute I just would have assumed a would have taken it and and was the player I was really fearing this week so yeah very very lucky with that um I'm really disappointed in Rogers Gordon and jotter all blanking I mean would Waker Rogers oh it's crazy and he played well last night as well and um people are saying like is he is he gonna go on this ridiculous run of looking like the best player on the pitch in every game and not getting any returns and um it is it is crazy I mean it's got to happen soon isn't it and they've still got good fixtures left so you've got to hope that it's going to drop for him soon but then I mean the Jan thing is all very weird I just don't know what they do I mean again Watkins subbed on 60 Minutes last night yeah little bit of on his leg Yeah I think he's all right I mean he'll start it'll start the weekend but what does Emory do with Duran because Duran's like like a immovable object at the moment you got to give him minutes haven't you and we're not just talking five and 10 you've got to give him a decent 2025 so I don't know does Watkins come off every game and that's the only way or does he get can he get Morgan Rogers out wide and Duran in with Watkins does that even work I don't know I don't know because is playing well Ramsay's playing well Duran's playing well Watkins isn't going anywhere it's very tricky to know what I mean I assume Duran would start yesterday and you know against young boys I know it was their first Champions League game in in kind of forever but I thought why not why not see I was I was quite surprised to see Rogers um play he got the 90 again didn't he last night Rogers as well don't think he yeah he did yeah yeah czy I didn't expect him to play I I thought Duran would start Rogers wouldn't start um but he just seems to I mean you're quite right he loves Rogers he's playing superbly but he's just not returning for us and and I just don't know I mean they've got the caribo Cup tie so we got to think that Duran will start that so maybe that means that he doesn't have a big impact on Watkins minutes at the weekend you can't Bank on it I think what I mean that's it I said that Watkins is back and Watkins is an option but if he's he's only ever played an hour so far in every game so like a we invest in a player that's only getting an hour because you know we've said before you want your Striker on for stoppage time because we know the XG goes up around that period so it's that's not great either is it so it's like yeah I don't know apart from Harland and obviously we'll see salah's had his best start to the season for a long time as well the other kind of second tier assets just I don't know they need to do more they need to do more to make the season what we thought it would be yeah yeah and I mean even even jot for example example I mean J was my kind of way about going against Salah uh and that just obviously hasn't and I'm really worried about his his potential to start because I thought gakpo played quite well yeah yesterday um and Diaz is getting 60 70 minutes in the league almost every week as well that's not really being talked about but he's he's not playing anywhere near near 90 um you see the comments as well from from slot saying he was gonna play gakpo as well but he was tired or something from his his Min Diaz flying around the world I know and and and jotter I don't know you you talked about it last week didn't you is he is he in the firmino role and and like did you see I don't know whether you saw J had hardly got the touch of the ball against for us like we shut him down completely and they just couldn't get the ball anywhere near him and apart from the one chance he he did have their best chance but he was so quiet like he was just not a factor at all and so the system that that slot is playing although it has got the best out of Diaz and we've seen him step up I've never seen jotter have less impact than than I'm seeing he's not playing a part in the buildup really and they're not getting they're not getting supply to him so that's that is a worry because how long is it before gapo becomes a factor in the middle down the middle or even dare I say it Darwin Nunes I don't think Darwin Nunes is I think Darwin Darwin isn't worry gone he's gone he's gone yeah yeah but but that's one good thing to come from this season so far because we don't want any of that yeah Darwin had come off the bench and started making a bit of a case for himself I think there would be people going there but yeah yeah luckily it's uh it's not us um gr and the goods uh on the screen lots of red arrows yeah this week as you can see pra and Harry both leading the way both on a red uh I'm on a green I'm one of four managers in the Great and the good uh on a on a green um I said I would I'd be happy with staying about where I was which was about 900k um got a green up to 636 okay so I'm approaching my best rank in the last two seasons which was about 400,000 last year it's got to be one of your best starts for a while isn't it I think it probably is I think it probably is my my best start for a while um yes hopefully can build on that not so good for you we were neck and neck and now there's a what a 30 point difference between us I'm trying to remember the last time we did a 23 points when was the last time we did a black box where you were beating me uh the last episode of the the end of the season one by one point I think I was beating you every week last season yeah no no I was beating you at one point because um you Ben to Super Nan right that that was game week two that was the mat challenge so like you're beating me by 20 points that's that's the biggest evidence that f is broken of course right regardless of everything else I've said the fact you'll beating me by 20 fbl is broken it's gone G's gone um late r exactly the same points48 I know and exact yeah I mean their teams are similar and and they've got Harland I mean like look at the start they've had and they've got harand so and I think they had Harland from the start didn't they so like harland's not the Silver Bullet you've got to have a decent team around him as well and a lot of managers I mean I think all the managers above me have got Harland and Salah now ready for ready for the forest game ironically a lot of people got him in for The Forest game and um and obviously the games at Bournemouth to come next week of this week of course so salah's not a differential for me anymore I've got to hope that that son or sacka get me Summit this week um and then with odard out and sacka at Man City probably not going to happen is it so I don't know I I we're talk about what I'm doing at the end of the show but I mean it's a grim read this even though there's a lot of Harland ownership there a lot of red yeah well shout out to Seb who has got the same points as Zar and late Riser but hasn't made any transfers at all this season he's he's committed to this getting as many transfers stored as he can isn't he Y and he got Inu Off the Bench this week yeah imagine making no transfers and still having Inu um if you are struggling if you are in the millions uh don't worry um if you look at the table on the bottom you'll be able to see that this season uh if you look at the Great and the good average positions at this point this is basically the worst start the the Great and the good have had so I remember 22 23 um that was a difficult season the average rank at this stage was 1.4 million the average rank at this season is 2 million look at it look at it in 2122 yeah 2 yeah wow so at this stage we the average was 240k so almost every manager in the great good had a really incredible start is that right wow okay yeah I know no isn't it and team value is the lowest it's been in the last four years 100.5 um yeah it's uh the transfers are about the same hit are about the same but those gameweek one teams just like you say haven't really performed and I think if you if you had Harland and reyer you probably had a decen start to the season if you didn't have either of those then you're probably two or three million that's probably about how it how is right nothing wrong with being two or three million as nothing wrong with I looked back last year and I was 3.1 million this time last year so you know just outside the top 10K right yeah but I mean I don't know I I didn't enjoy last season at all despite getting 12K and a good rank I thought it was the most tedious season ever so I'm more I'm more about like is this going to be a season where it's going to be twists and turns and and it looked like it was going to be and I I don't know I sound like a broken record and maybe it's all going to perk up a bit in a few weeks maybe this week it's going to turn it around sacka goes and gets a couple of goals and sun looks amazing and Palmer comes good and all of a sudden everyone wants I really hope so no we don't want that we don't we don't need any more of that as we're about to see in a minute well we'll see uh right now so this these tables these these tables are the are the starts after four game weeks the top 10 in terms of points um per per start so Harland has led the way in each of the last three seasons after game week four um he got six goals in four games last season he had six goals in four games the season before that he's got nine goals in four games this time out his points per start is 13.5 uh which is obviously the highest uh probably the highest we've ever seen right it is it is yeah yeah there can't be players had nine in nine and four and it's also officially his best four run of four game weeks he's ever had in those three seasons as well so he's beaten his personal best for that span of game weeks and he's beaten his best start ever I mean this this this highlights what a strong starter we all is and fine we we knew that but wow I mean even pep said didn't he that he's surprised at what he's seen from him um and it's interesting isn't it that Salah and Holland are the top two and we were all saying before the season started well they've had a rest they've had the summer off and and obviously you can say it's down to that I mean it may not be but it it it it probably was a factor in that they're the two top scores Salah on 43 points I think that's his best ever start as well I had to look at his past Seasons um and the Scout data doesn't unfortunately have FB points right the way back to 2021 but um his previous best in the last five years has been 38 points so he has he has had an incredible start as well for his by his standards he wasn't in the top 10 last season or the top 10 the season before I think he got 23 points last season at this stage and 25 the season before so he's almost doubled well not quite but he's you he's added 18 points onto last season's tally at this stage I mean that is amazing is it for for a player as well in the last year of their contract you know getting on a bit in the league with all the competition around him um you know with J with Diaz with all these other amazing players and yeah he's still 10 point 10.8 without Harland that would be the best start Freddy player in the last three years for sah but because harland's there it's it's kind of equipped it um Diaz is on the list uh points of 8.8 that would put him um that would also put him second I think to yeah in the last two years that'd be higher than Ino last year um oh we Rodrigo Rodrigo's Amazing Star God I remember that I didn't get any of those any of those points um but yeah a great start for him got got a shout out Gabrielle and Rea though I mean I I went into this with no Arsenal defense whatsoever I thought you know games against Brian games against Villa game against Spurs I could make do without a Defender and and try and get to six without one Rey has just been unbelievable and the only other goalkeeper who features on his top 10 in the last three seasons amazingly is Dean Henderson I know forest and the irony of that because he's been bloody awful for people and I've got him in my team I'm literally looking at R who I want and looking at Henderson thinking oh dear he's taunting you there because he saved a penalty for Forest as well didn't he um 22 in four games show you how difficult it is for a keeper to get in this top 10 it's like you know Henderson's in there because of a pen save and 22 saves so that's an incredible obviously return of saves in terms of save points as well I mean we we we would never expect Ry to have 15 Saves by now would we we wouldn't expect him to have three clean sheets and 15 saves we might expect to have three clean sheets and five saves but but not 15 and because he's got 15 saves he's also picked up six bonus points which again I don't know did he even get that many bonus points last season for the entirety of the Season I'll G have a look um because because Gabrielle and C only got about six all season last season R got six six bonus points yeah there he go so he's already leveled his bonus points tally for last season in four game weeks I mean that's and yet we were saying start of the Season well you can forget bonus points for Keepers well we we were saying forget bonus points for Keepers if they concede even if they make like 11 saves they're not getting a bonus but it does look like if a goalkeeper keeps a clean sheet they are very very likely to get at least one bonus point and he is they will get the most clean sheets this season but but I would say he's in a team where because obviously the other factors is shots on Target and fouls one and perhaps you know Arsenal haven't done enough in those in those metrics to rival him and knock him out the BPS like they're not full of players who are having loads of shots and so I mean we'll get to the attacking data later I don't think Arsenal are in the top three or four teams there so perhaps and you know with oard out perhaps they're not going to be um maybe they're gonna have to rely on winning games one on two nil um but it works so why not shout out to mumo on here who is ninth on the list for this season with his his two goals against Southampton is his goal before that uh obviously he was second last year after that great run before he had and yeah that might be the move I Look to do in that J to mumo move which is maybe a bit a bit earlier than I would have liked but might be might be sensible because he clearly gets off to good starts um so yeah want to one to monitor uh let's take a look at some team data then let's start with team data uh defense not huge amounts of changes from when we talked about this last week we got Liverpool at the top then Man City and then forest and yeah I think talk to us about about Forest how how on Earth did they stop Liverpool well I think that in in Ana and um and Moreno we've got I mean th th those two on anfield were absolutely fantastic I mean the two of the best fullback performances I've seen from a forest team um not just Moreno I mean he made six he won six of his seven tackles against Salah Salah really didn't really get much out of him at all and I knew at half time I was saying I think I tweeted I said I don't I just don't see sah getting anything because we're just throttling them and every time Salah gets anywhere near the ball Moreno's on him we were so aggressive we were right in their face and M Movic and and Melo are just a great combination Murillo obviously very mobile low center of gravity milinkovic a bit of a brute strong in the air really strong in the air and a leader so those two and the two fullbacks look it looks like a really good defensive unit so I do think that we were top five for defensive data last season I think or top six but we didn't really we didn't turn into clean sheets I think we kept one didn't we I don't know I think one or two clean sheets is all we got I think this season though is different because the whole season yeah I think we only kept a couple of clean sheets All Season it was pretty bad um I think that this season though we will we've we've solved the setpiece issue with melan kovic there and I just think we're growing as a team and yeah we're going to get more clean sheets and suddenly I mean as a I mean I'm probably opposite to you I kind of don't try and talk up Forest too much because I know that what are you implying what are you implying I know that as FBO assets they're not I wouldn't advise going there right Gibbs white maybe at the start of season I was pushing him but I wasn't wasn't talking about our defense even though the data was good last season but having watched that I do think that Moreno at 44 oreno at 44 both of them at 44 really good prospects yeah really good because I think we are going to go we haven't we didn't concede at Southampton we haven't conceded at Liverpool we've won four straightway games now and we've kept clean sheets in the last two we're gonna C start keeping clean sheets at home and we've got Fulham Palace Leicester West Ham Newcastle in a run there that I would say there's two or three clean sheets there potentially because I think our defense is strong enough to keep to keep Fulham Palace Leicester and even West Ham I think we'll get a couple of clean sheets out of that four so yeah if you're looking for 4 five44 oena Moreno probably would be my choice because he offers so much going forward and and so it is probably time for me to take the nonforest blinkers off and go yeah yeah have a look at them yeah as soon as you start to show a bit of Faith it's all it's all G to go I know that's the thing we'll get fresh at Brighton I mean because it's it's still I mean Robinson's just had a a price Rise um but he goes into Newcastle Forest Man City Villa in the next four which isn't great I mean then Everton away Everton are awful defensively but are managing to to score goals um and then it's brenford who are also managing to score whereas like you say forest around that time Brighton Fulham Palace Leicester West Ham seems if I was buying a Defender now it definitely wouldn't be Robinson um I'd be look I'd be looking an or I've just got a soft spot for Moreno oh yeah he's he's he's got the quality going forward as well I mean I would say he is as good as Robinson going forward he is an attacking fullback and he's probably got better delivery than Robinson um Robinson's obviously got that relationship down that side now and he's been in Fulham for a couple of seasons and whereas Moreno hasn't so he's more settled but I think Moreno will flourish at Forest and and yeah I think it's good I think it's good to talk about he's got to be someone we look at any more love for Sals um I think weer I mean like the back four looks solid but the keeper is still a worry we will buy a keeper in January I've absolutely no doubt but until then you can go sales yeah because he's going to play every week I think because I don't think um I don't think theu girl's ready but we are undoubtedly buy a keeper in January because I think it's obviously now the weak spot in the team um so we'll address it and I think we'll go back in for kellerer I think we'll try again so okay yeah yeah but yeah and Elsewhere on his table I mean Villa showing up well Arsenal in fifth I mean it's perhaps what we expect I mean is there a defense there you expect to be higher maybe United you expect to be pushing a little bit higher Newcastle haven't really picked up from where they were last season despite having an easy run in terms of fixtures their defense still doesn't look worth investment and and what can you say about Everton at the moment I mean yeah it's yeah there's not too many surprises I would expect brenford to be higher I mean ahead of their good run you'd expect them to climb that table right yeah obviously vaner B's come in four million option for us uh I guess there's a slight concern about whether if he if he doesn't play three at the back whether he keeps his place but you've always been pretty hot on him haven't you like 25 million pounds they they paid yeah he's a good player yeah I think he's he's he's pretty much I'd definitely be taking the punt on him if I could if they back four he's not guaranteed a start because Collins Collins and pinnick at the moment of the first choice I would say yeah uh Newcastle I'm surprised that being being a bit I know obviously they they paid that Southampton um game but teams look really easy to to get at them there doesn't seem to be a lot of um solidity there wolves carve them open time and time again um really they were lucky to escape that game you know two individual moments of absolute Brilliance another kind of share rocket although a little bit of a a deflection but the bars winner was you know worthy of winning winning any game but W wolves had some really good chances in in that match um and they're doing well I mean look at the if you look at the rating like you know we know how tough the start they've had but they're 11th on the on the table so credit to to them um yeah I like wolves uh you know I like stran Larson I thought he played really well in that game there there's a lot of play like a Nori a lot of players who we've talked about who we might consider but yeah it's just not not the best time for them um yeah nothing really massively surprising I guess the only one to really talk about here is is Villa because obviously K is really popular but clean sheets just don't seem to be coming but the defensive underlying that's a good we've seen this before with teams like Palace in previous years when defensive data's always been at the highest but just hasn't translated I don't know about coner I'm still not I'm not convinced he's a good option out of Robinson and cono who would you keep yeah that's a good question because Robinson's got the attacking threat but con's got the fixtures I guess you would keep coner out of the two if I had to pick one of the two it probably would be coner but I don't think i' I'd pick him so I'd rather go for Moreno or or rer or um I mean who what we come on to defenders in a bit Davis I think leave leave Davis now Swit his fixtures looking better I think I'd take a punt on him because just for a bit of excitement really yeah or sagawa you're just trying to make me say Sara aren't you Sara good we talked about him last week um but I prefer Leaf Davis I mean like for me set plays and and I think it's only he's got one assist but we haven't really seen the best of him yet it which needs home games if you look at the ticker I think they've got some fixtures coming up where you'd expect them to start showing up as an attacking Force I mean their bottom of the attacking data we're probably about to see that so they haven't really been able to to flex in that way but I think that's coming I really like the look of dap and I think they've got players they they've bought well and I think of the promoted teams they they for me are the one that I think could break out and give us some joy in terms of fbl assets dap was like horrible because I I went to the I went to the Brighton game um missed the first 20 minutes because of a lot of stress uh but D when dap came off the whole crowd breed the side relief because you know he didn't offer too much but that run he went on when he just completely outpaced van heck and I thought I I thought van heex either going to bring him down for a penalty or he's going to score and you know just off the the top of the bar it was so a great option Davis was was really Shackled though he barely came forward at all in that game and it was yeah it switch just put all the men behind the ball and just look to to hit on the on the counter which is I think gavves is a hell of a player as well should have got him every ball we put in he's there just heading it away he's yeah he was he was brilliant uh attack we got City at the top top attack obviously got Harland putting chance is away Liverpool still second despite the blank at Forest Manchester United in third I saw was it Jan batra tweeted about rashford trying to get people in in you know invested in him yeah I mean what do you think I was gonna mention him later no you don't you're not I was like I was like no we can't be going near rashford but you know a goal against the mighty barley in the cup good performance before two didn't he I I mean we talked I mean I moaned about what we need you know we need a bit of a bit of a pep and um I think if rashford was to come good that's that's the kind of thing we need right you know like a I don't know I mean I I mean obviously everyone would flood to him I think he's so streaky though isn't he that's the trouble it's like it's it's time in it with rashford I mean couple of seasons ago I got him on at the right time and I CED him a few times and it turned out really well for me but then I think you know we've seen him just collapse again and yeah it'll be good to see him back to some for and being in our thoughts again I would welcome it I think yeah I I don't know I mean the other option is is gacho but he's not starting is he because Dio's no keeping him but he he's he's brilliant every time he comes off the bench some you know he scored in in the last Premier League game OB he scored yesterday as well I I don't know how long Doo can keep him him out for um he will be an option at 65 at some point in the season I'm sure he will yeah yeah I mean I I know you're not United fans feel is a bit of a mystery as to why he's not starting yet um and until he does we can't go there but yeah I mean there could be options coming from United which would be nice because they've been a bit of a it's been a yeah a derf is we haven't really been a to go there at all um for a while defensively they've been really shaking I still wouldn't trust them defensively but if they if those two come out then yeah it'd be that would be very useful indeed Viller in fourth Brighton in in fifth we we did show a bit of a different side to us I thought in that if switch game and not in a good way which is how much we struggle to break down um you know that kind of low block defending really deep team and yeah we we've seen that before that's been classic Brighton you know lots of kind of half chances dominating the game not being able to kill it off um I think other than mata's uh you know shot which he he should have scored with we didn't really create that much and I think ifwi were actually fairly comfortable um against us because we couldn't do what we normally do which is you know create loads of space out wide get all Wingers like cutting in hitting on the counter because there was nothing to really counter because they weren't really they didn't have the ball so our High Press High counter method didn't really work so I wanted to maybe see we had like a plan B for that and you know against Everton we we we we maybe did we maybe looked better as as the game went on but we didn't really against we could have played that game for another two hours and not scored against ipswitch you're getting me very excited for Sunday because I'd like to think we're better defensively and better offensively than it witch so that's going to be interesting but will you go for it um no I think we'll probably play a very similar game to we did at Liverpool um I I would have thought I think we'll start Hudson adoy but I don't think we'll start both of them um yeah I think we are going to beat you I think we are so I know well we'll talk about predictions in a bit my my dad is four out of four for Brighton so far he's predicted the draws against ipsw and Arsenal which is outrageous and the wins against Everton and Manchester United so he he thinks we're gonna win so it's um it's very different to you the big thing is if we got Pedro back R was really ineffective was he that game oh that's good news for Pedro owners yeah it is good news I'm I'm gonna say it and I I probably get Slamm for it but I'm sure Pedro comes back into the 11 if you got him yeah no I think you're right yeah that's nice uh we're fifth on the table look at the bottom three though Southampton Lester it switch just what I was about to come to and and Everton as well I mean Everton Southampton Lester and I switch they've got to be the four favorites to be fighting it out for promotion um out relegate yeah obviously relegation not promotion um they're and ipswitch are the ones who I think have got the best chance of yeah staying up I think at this point yeah um out of the four I mean Jamie vard's scoring goals but he's barely having any shots and you got to think that conversion isn't goingon to isn't going to carry on but yeah it switch right down x n p 90 of 0.39 that is you know Leicester a 19th with 0.83 they' that is incredibly low it is but I think the fixtures are King here that's why I think they will start to come out there sh I think when McKenna looked at the pictures he thought we're not going to be able to show ourselves until what five or six games in so I think that they've given a good account themselves already and I think there's enough there to make me think there's po so we'll see I really hope so because I really want be great if Lee Davis is is is goes one further than doubt he did last year for loon you know goes to double figures for assists or something that' be great um other thing to mention here I mean we talked about you know the Arsenal attack and it hasn't been on point yet which is perhaps where Rya has been in the bonus where it shows there is their 12 right 1.25 XG on penalty per 0 I'm very surprised at that um I mean they again again against Arsenal um I don't know what's wrong with I can't even speak properly against Brighton they obviously dominated the play sacka got a lot of joy down the side they had a couple of chances but nothing massively clearcut I wouldn't I wouldn't have thought even H's goal was a brilliantly well taken lob um against against Spurs they struggled in the first 20 30 minutes to even get out I Spurs played really well massively on the front foot too so yeah I'm I'm surprised in the sense that they've got so much like great attacking like talent in the team um and you think with games against wolves um and against Brighton they would they would maybe have created a little bit more um than they they have done sack are really interest to know what to do with we talked about him at the start already but if odard is out and this is going to be a bit of a pattern then yeah I think he's he's sellable isn't he well the other thing is it impacts havit as well like havit was going to be perhaps a real hope for us as an eight million forward but if he's going to play the Midfield role which looks like he is we're not going to gamble on tra are we as a field asset maybe we will but that's how it's looking I mean Jesus is a threat to tr Arlo so I look at it and think the oard injury it redu his sack's appeal it moves havoc's back which jedu is his appeal tr's not an option because jeesus is a threat to him Suddenly It's like well if you want Arsenal you just go Ry and a Defender don't you and it's like that's that's what I meant when I started the show with a bit of oh dear it feels like things are Contracting before our very high is and the OD injury is just another twist that does it really I mean the thing for Watkins is another twist that we didn't expect that like who expected us to think oh Watkins is an next min's problem no chance of that we thought it was a 90 minute player didn't we but I don't see that stopping either so it's annoying it's just annoying like hopefully sacka comes through it and saaka takes the mantle and goes even without OD God I'm going to be the key man and my output's not going to be affected but we'll see I mean we'll see the Jew is out isn't it I've just had a message from focal uh about about the OBS uh video resolution so I've just changed a couple of settings on on OBS uh I can't honestly everything looks fine on my screen so we're using OBS and we're not using OBS are but we are technically because we're streaming it to thingy anyway I've tried I've tried a few things let me know if that stunt made any difference whatsoever uh maybe it has maybe hasn't um but yeah let me let me know uh should get some play data we can let's have a look at goalkeepers to start with I think we did a quite a big segment um on this I don't think anything's massively changed too much apart from the fact that sales might be an option for us uh going forward but I still think you're going to go ryer or you're gonna go flecken at this point aren you yeah I think that's the way isn't it I mean what I interesting what wild cards do I I think because of the oard injury we're going to see wild cards with Ry and Gabrielle now um which you know at the start of the Season people really have gone V has too much to pay for a keeper but it's a bit like Harland is it nowhere near as um profitable but 29 points for a keeper is still good and I'm I mean I've been on the end of I mean I've had Seasons where I've own that keeper like flecking on 12 points and started looking up and thinking I thought not having a good keeper is not a big deal but there's already 17 points between fle and and Martin and and ryer and Henderson there's 21 points different so is that 21 points worth a million it probably is it probably is isn't it so and we're not talking about Rea who's playing for a team who isn't about you know they're the best defensive team as well so I do think we're starting to come around to the idea now I'd be surprised if Rey wasn't very popular in wild cards anyway yeah I mean look at Henderson down in 23rd eight points um Ry matched him in an away game against Spurs his entire season points it's uh yeah absolutely it's amazing how that adds up how the keeper really because you your perception is it's the position that has the least impact on your team I think it still probably is but when there is one or two keepers really racing away with it and we've seen it in previous Seasons you look up and think oh God the Gap is quite big it's much bigger than I expected Fen I think you know is a very good bet because he'll make saves and they got great fixtures so four FS are still going to be an option because of fen's fixtures but I do think the odard thing might make people think well I don't need two Arsenal attackers so I'm going to go an Arsenal Defender and I'll go ryer I think that might be what we see I think Ray's Reay is the pick I think Ray is the pick out of the Arsenal defense I think R's the pick out of the goalkeepers um his price hasn't gone up yet which he must be on the verge of going up to to 5'6 um he'll be a six million goalkeeper by the end of the the season I've got no doubt um and I mean how many points can he get he's he's on track to score the most of any goalkeeper ever surely because I mean how many clean sheets are they going to get this season 38 games they could get 15 men I say 15 15 20 15 20 clean sheets yeah I mean the thing is he's showing to be a really good keeper isn't he as well because like in Pre I think last season it was like well he's a yeah he's a top 10 Keeper in a top one defense but when tested ry's you know gonna concede goals but actually this season he's shown up to be pretty outstanding when when they have let chances through and they have he's he's made some really good saves so he deserves to be there on Merit it's not because he's you know the defender has done all the work for him he actually has put in shifts and made some good saves so you're getting a very good Keeper in front of or behind a very good defense um so but I do think four FES could still come out sales we've talked about fleen as well so it's not a done deal not yet for br he's very impressive I thought he was he was very impressive against hip switch as well and when he was called into action he he just looks very astute very confident um yeah I I do still worry I did the forest pod today uh with uh with Matt which was which was really good um he lets me talk about Brighton when I go on there unlike you who shut me down yeah okay very nice he actually asks me my opinions on on Brighton lets me go on monologue I must have a word him he's got it all wrong yeah it's been lovely um I can't remember the point I was trying to make but yeah it was H you worried about wor about the ball over the top that's it um I don't think we've got like well exactly yeah well you haven't got any Pace or we haven't well not really I mean like if alanga comes on then you got to worry but I don't think he'll start so I mean Hudson or against velman would be interesting yeah he reminded me of um last season we we come off the back of that Roma thrashing and then we played you and you put out a really weird like was terrible team and we ended up winning that game and I just think surely you play Hudson or Danga against veltman and I mean who's even gonna be at left back it's probably gonna be kadogo I'd say um because I don't think Hood's gonna play there again kadogo got some minutes in in the last game it's going to be that'll be a tough matchup for him I think Langer is is class but you don't think he'll start no I think he'll play W prow and Anderson and we'll try and win a few few free kicks around the box and let War prows do his thing so we'll see I just want war war prows is a player that when I've ever watched him for Southampton and West Ham I've thought to myself I wish we had a player who every time the free kick is won you're you're genuinely excited because you're expecting it to be on target if not going in and now he's in our team I just can't wait for the first fre kick we win because that anticip score this and you know the opposition fans are like oh Christ it's really good I really I really enjoy having him in the team so I think for that reason he'll play um yeah we'll see anyway let's move on to Defenders so we can't talk about you're you're going right you're going on Sunday yeah yeah yeah I'll be doing my walkout videos from Brighton on Sunday morning and taking some footage from the game as well so make sure you get there in plenty of time unlike yellow and I who just completely messed up our timing what happened we we we just we left a bit late a bit too late and it was one of those ones where we would have got away with it if there wasn't all the traffic in the world and then we got to we got to M Park uh where you because you have to get a park and ride bus over to the stadium from from the from from Mil road that was completely full so we had to park at the wi Dean which was our old stadium and get a taxi over to the stadium we got stuck in traffic yeah we a football match who would have fought it I absolutely outage the game had bloody started it was you know 10 minutes in and there was there was yeah it's basically however long you think it's going to take you to get to the AMX add another hour onto it um it was funny because we walking around the like right the outside of the wood bean and I said to you know this is this is our old stadium she was like this this was a stadium just just about um this is Defender data um on the on the screen look at that milinkovic right at the top 0.66 is that just because of like one really good chance yeah that one for match of day challenge where I went oh remember yeah so um yeah but he second yeah he's obviously a threat to set plays and obviously with James wpr's taking him we could see something from him so yeah but I still prefer the fullbacks if you're looking at Forest players um yeah go ahead Trent and then Romero and delit as well showed up didn't he for the goals at Sav Anton he did yeah I mean let's talk about Trent quickly I mean what at what point does Trent become an issue for us because we're talking about him like he's completely indispensable and you know we wouldn't go anywhere near him that's that's fine but it's still no attacki returns for him he is still seven million-ish and there are going to be wild cards being played are we entering into a period where there might be a case to go without him I wouldn't personally not yet um I can see what you're saying um I mean I don't know against Forest he didn't really C he had four chances but none of those really were good were good chances um but it was a difficult game for him the best is to come I still think that he's going to be you you're not going to be hitting registering an average of 0.64 and not getting returns so we will start seeing assist soon um and he'll get two three four goals maybe over the season as well I I still think that teams Wild Card teams will be buil built with him in I don't think there's strong Alternatives yet I mean City Defenders yeah vardal is there of course Lewis is there but Lewis doesn't really cost you money and and and he's obviously still an option he's starting tonight which I didn't expect um so why you can go Lewis to cover the city defense why would you not have the money to go Trent to cover to cover Liverpool unless unless of course you're going to go Gabrielle and porro and Rya so maybe like that combination means you need to bring your budget down for Trent so maybe maybe you know the emergence of the Arsenal defense is the way to go rather than going to Arsenal attackers you go to Arsenal Defenders that might mean people have to move money out of their defense but I wouldn't do it I'd stick with it it's four game week small sample and and the data suggests that returns are coming all sack is hang on he as a season keeper last week um yeah absolutely I mean it's just one of those on like Rogers isn't it like you watch Rogers play you think he's close to points and it the weeks go on and on he's not really delivering um Rogers is a five million asset you can bench but Trent needs to start getting something but I mean these stats are so encouraging aren't they like 0.64 EX on P 90 you know he's creating three chances a game um the second best is poro with 2.5 is also a good option but it's it's even higher than that um he's he's not going anywhere he's not going anywhere from my team I'm keeping him yeah and I I don't think wild cards will overlook him yet um you're right patience might run out but I think that's Folly and and I also think defensively Liverpool are better this season too so you're gonna get more clean sheets anyway which makes it easier if he was eight million Yeah by now we probably see people losing patience but I think at 7even million with the with the options around him um I think that's fine I think you hold him and I think he will will come good and then some so yeah you'd rather have him than Diaz J would you I think if you're going to pick one other than seller yeah are the x-min um you know they're only getting an hour and that's a real shame isn't it I mean I really want Diaz to be a thing but with Gatos showing up so well last night um you've got to think that it's going to continue that we're going to see Diaz every time you get to an hour mark between 60 and 70 minutes if you own Diaz or josy you're expecting it aren't you you're expecting the ball to go up and you're almost thinking oh don't kick it out try and play try play for another 10 minutes without kicking it out because it's a horrible feeling I've owned those assets before and eventually you start going n let's go to an E or a gon who are gonna give me 90 minutes basically yeah Lewis let's talk about Lewis I think I said to you last week is there a chance Lewis could go to left back and we were both we were both kind of like yeah I mean he could do but kind of why why would he because obviously gavardo was there um that is what happened happened I don't know if that's good for him or or not because he's surely not going to carry on it's good in the way that he can he's obviously versatile he can play in different positions so he's got more Roots into the team but yeah you'd rather he would nail down a spot on the right potentially doesn't case that he's on the right tonight he's on the right tonight and um I'm shocked because I thought Walker was back in the weekend to get him ready for tonight and then Walker doesn't show up tonight I don't know if there's an injury I haven't seen that but um I think it's clear that you know Lewis is getting the level of minutes that Lewis is getting he obviously was off at halim on Saturday that must have been with this in mind I guess I don't know it's just really strange we can't yet figure it out and I think now that European fixures are here we'll get more answers I was chatting to Luke about it and it's like it's almost like we've got to throw out what we know so far about Pep's lineups and kind of start again and reassess and tonight's lineup is is interesting it's not what I expected I did expect Walker to be in there and Lewis maybe to make way do we think Lewis starts against Arsenal I I personally not expecting him to and I've got him benched but if I knew he was going to start I might even start him because you know he does offer you something something going forward as well he's just the darling at the moment and at the moment I just see him St in most games would you buy him now yes I think I think you would if you wild card I think you give it another week I think you want to see what happens against Arsenal if you're wild card in six it's pretty perfect and most people are going to be wild card in gameweek six or seven now would have for unless people are going to push it right out I think you wait and see what happens against Arsenal if he starts against Arsenal I said doneal isn't it you've got to you got to go there I think so because eventually I think it's a bit like Trent the attacking data here .41 xra on penalty he's got one assist so far he's going to add to that with that you know in that team he's going to get more assists and perhaps one or two goals as well so you can't avoid him I don't you know I don't think you can ignore him yep uh I wanted to talk about Robertson he was a bit of a a darling this this week I know quite a few people did um Gabrielle to J robber I think Ben Kellin did didn't he oh got hurt isn't it ouch yeah it was um it was it was quite quite a popular move do you think they'll people be regretting that now I mean he shows up well on this he's 10th on the list .32 XG we've talked about Liverpool you know looking decent defensively he got the rest in the Champions League yesterday Sim played in that so you got to think he's pretty nailed on um to start I still think he's a he's a pretty good asset but I still think at six million I'd rather have Gabrielle I'd rather have sber um you know I'd rather have porro I'd rather have Tren he's still quite far down the list for me I don't know if I Gabrielle yes I'd rather have Gabrielle I think there is for me if we know Gabrielle and Cela both start every game Who Would You Rather Have I think there's quite a gap between Gabriel and civa I think we talked about it earlier um in the pre-season about who's going to be the threat at set plays and and what we saw at Spurs was he was a monster wasn't he I mean like Romero just didn't know what to do and there there is a difference isn't there when the set Pieces come in there's a difference in the level of threat between CRA and Gabrielle and I think that in the end could tell and could mean that Gabrielle gets gets more points but I guess is there still a naging doubt that CBA is more nailed I guess there is right yeah I guess so but Gabriel has started it's bit of a contrast to last season when he was dropped and kind of had to fight his way back into the team um he he started so so impressively um I mean no no no one scored more from set pieces than Gabrielle since he signed no player and no Defender scored more set pieces than Gabrielle since he signed as well so you know he he he could go on and I mean who's who's got the record for most goals for for Defenders probably I can't even I can't even think of it might maybe um John Terry got didn't he ianov he he scored quite a few ivovic a few yeah I mean he could have a season where he gets seven eight goals yeah that's what I'm thinking I I think that could happen because the set pieces from Arsenal look even better D than they did last season and they were scoring for for fun uh they just caused so many issues and when when you're up against a keeper like Vicario who you know you know he's not going to come out and claim it very well it just it's just an easy way to Target points and to win the game with that is just it was funny though I was watching Liverpool and Milan last night and and Liverpool got the first goal canate from a set play and you watch the goal back and you thought oh my God just look at like they've got nothing to stop Liverpool at set plays like canato and Van djk they look like they just want it far more than any of the Milan defense and then 20 minutes later vanite scores as well same thing and it was like that Arsenal Spurs you know you saw set plays and you just think Spurs Spurs just aren't competing for the ball at set plays they're just if the delivery is right it's over they score and they and it happened and you've got to be really strong at set plays to keep Arsenal out because often the delivery is good and in Gabrielle they've got someone who just attacks the ball ferociously and and and it's hard to stop it really is so yes I'd rather have Gabrielle over Robertson because I think it's going to be Arsenal will keep more clean sheets and they'll keep clean sheets in difficult games and Gabrielle's always there it's hard to predict when the goals come but they will come I think he'll get five I think he'll get five for sure yeah so do I yeah I think was was it meron who who said the other day he was like you know sometimes people just Chuck up their center backs and they kind of TR up and you know it it they're doing it because they're told to um whereas the Arsenal center backs go up thinking they're going to score every time yeah they go up um yeah I I I'd be I'd be surprised if Gabrielle didn't get five goals this season um maybe they get shared a bit more between him him and CA maybe the other thing is if odard is out is artetta thinking we're gonna have to make more set place now because you know scoring goals from open Play might be more difficult for us so they might even over index on them they might even put more effort in but their set play coach is is first class and they and they're scoring you know the patterns they run the routines they are you look at him you think oh God how you stop that the movement and aggression is just different level so yeah and a massive shout out to um James of Planet fbl because I was listening to his um ask James podcast and the questions kept coming in you know should I bench Gabrielle do this every time James was like don't bench Gabrielle do not bch Gabrielle against us thing coming yeah he was like they he was like both CRA and Gabriel were both have a good chance against us from a set piece um I can't remember sleep having one but obviously gabri needed one to to score so we absolutely called that um yeah I mean I guess the question is if you had to pick one out of Gabrielle and Rea where would you go I'd want them both now I think but yeah no that's not that's not an option I'd probably go Reay just because you can get poro and you can get Trent and you can get Lewis so you don't have to have Gabrielle but I I think he's by far the best alternative to three now I mean moving porro up to Gabrielle probably people going to look at that I imagine look at this and Robo eight ball got Gabrielle Off the Bench for Pedro oh disgraceful that is that is absolutely I was happy with Smith row but that is next level any other Defenders yeah fair play any other Defenders mention Ben White hasn't shown up yet he's further down there we've talked about AA Moreno isn't on this table yet but a few home games expect him to show up because he will start creating eight nor was going to be an option but wolves have gone back to a back four haven't they so that takes the Shine off him a little bit I think more than a little bit maybe and I've read that walls 16 games without a clean sheet now yeah so defensively they are there to be got at really so maybe you know we talked about him last week but maybe we need to call our boots on him a bit uh Dena um did we talk about him I'm only joking but he got he got the assist didn't he we slay him last week he slay he turned with an assist um played again as well last night in the Champions League he's Matson isn't getting anywhere near the team at the moment no it's just not what we expected at all was it and um he's playing well I guess the only other one I pick out is leaf Davis here he's 29th on this table .16 watch him climb that let's see if he can make the top 10 in a few weeks because I think I wouldn't be surprised if he's climbing that table soon y I think um focal might be on something with these Graphics by the way because apparently they are a lot better yeah okay any complaints while um what I did if you care is I put up the bit rate on OBS oh well thanks to focal for that uh midfielders we got gacho at the top we spoke about him a little while a little while ago 2.34 X non P 90 obviously he hasn't has he started yet he started One D started all not started one game that is madness goalen assist for for him um obviously we can't really consider him I mean Barnes is the same isn't he uh you thought Barnes might might keep Gordon out the side but turns out the other side tell you what he's got to start I mean I when he came on I immediately stuck him in my so rare team and he got me the goal because I knew that he's going to make an impact I think he's been playing really well when he's been on the pitch for Newcastle did well in preseason as well I just don't see how how can leave him out now um because he carries so much direct threat and him and Gordon I mean I I didn't think C played well again I mean I watched the game and I was like as an eak owner first half I was like he might as well go off because I just couldn't see him doing anything know they were gon was good Gordon looked really Lively but that was about it I just don't know what's missing from them this season the The Verve has gone The Verve and the Vigor and the I don't know have you watched them and I've just been totally unconvinced every time I think the the biggest problem is is losing trippier losing the amount of chances he created you think about the start of last season how effective was they were looking to get the ball to him at every opportunity they could so he could create something from the riot and now he's not really in the team they've moved Gordon over to the to the other side um there's just not a lot of creativity in the side so no you're right that's it yeah yeah so they're asking for players to step up with individuals So it's b like watching England um play you know there there's not not a whole amount of cohesion be between the team so they're looking for the big players to step up and create something kind of out of nothing and that is what happened in the Ws game but but I wasn't impressed with them and they've had really good results it's been a really good start of the season results wise but in every match I've been pretty disappointed with them and I'm holding Gordon I mean where's Gordon on this list is he on the top he's not even the top 20 to 30 yeah 30 .68 isn't too bad actually it's pretty good no he has he has played well and um yeah it's just yeah it's just I I just something isn't right at Newcastle and um yeah it makes me wonder as an eak owner how long I can hold him until we've got to we need it to click and he's another example of what we you know isak is a player that if you haven't gone Harland or you haven't gone Harland and Salah you can hold isak and hope where he might be able to trade blows with them too but no not sign of it really because Nas aren't playing well enough yeah no I agree with that uh jotters six on the list we've been talking about him talking about him sort of being you know being a bit poor the last few games but the stats are are impressive I mean Diaz is third 1.39 EX on P for 90 jot is there with 1.25 um and salah's in fourth at 1.31 sort of sandwiched in the middle between them but even with these stats I I'm just not convinced on on Jo I think I think he probably has to go for me right do you think he start bouth I think there's a risk there because of Gat poos performance last night because you got to think Diaz comes back in and Gat post Stak in a claim I I think he loves joto I think I mean and we know that slot doesn't doesn't alternate his team very much although he has he did say last night well we haven't played midweek yet and so yeah I mean J starting last night would suggest that perhaps he does alternate it and and let's face it he's not going to look at the forest performance and think that it worked but he was pleased last night with what he saw but then GPO played a big part in that so you've got to think GST do a start isn't he so yeah there there's a risk there for sure yeah y yeah I think I probably will get rid um Smith row 5.5 million you sold him uh this actually he's up to 5.7 Now isn't he he's he's had a couple of price Rises gold and assist for him still coming off around the 70 minute mark But ex 9 .83 I'm happy with him easy hold easy hold yeah I I do regret selling him I mean the only reason I sold him was because I had the money to go directly Smith Ro toza which meant I could keep son and on the off chance he got something at AR or maybe this week against brenford that was probably worth doing but I regret it because had I gone son to um sonto I'd have had money to to to take whis out now for probably maybe even Watkins I don't know I'd have to do the calculation but I think so so it would have given me more options than my transfer this week had I done that and of course me throw out scored some but yeah it's it's tough got that wrong but it's it could have gone the other way I suppose as well I did expect Arsenal to maybe give up more ground Declan rice there but Spurs never looked like scoring for me they just didn't create enough and S was AB I thought I thought he had a poor game really so yeah Smith row with heavy heart and and maybe if I'm wild carding soon he's someone I will maybe get back oh no classic reversal how you feeling about e now because the underlying stats are good 0.93 he 18 you want more you yeah I mean he's he's shown I mean they seo's had 20 shots and A's had 18 so they're they're the top two for shot volume from Midfield but um it's just not had the output just the one goal and obviously the pens thing now you we thought that was part of the contract when we signed him and it's it's not now because mata's maybe taking them all but so it really is dependent on that I I do think returns will come Man United and Everton next to you've got to keep him for those two because I think he will threaten United because pis will raise himself for that game and Everton well they're conceding three goals in every game so yeah you've got to think he's in in line for something there and out of the cup last night as well to Southampton it's bad for Sean isn't it [ __ ] bad dear but we are G to talk about k l in a minute maybe he's the one to turn him around uh Rogers if you're wondering is 63rd on this list is actually 90 isn't great 0.37 he's more of an eye test player isn't he he's the classic he's the classic grass versus spr sheet yeah I think he is he is literally grass FC's mascot now because I watch him every week and I think how the hell has he not got anything uh from this but I mean he is getting a 90 is five million The Villa fixures are still great it's just like this week for example I probably got a bench one of Smith row or Rogers and that is such a difficult choice because I think the obviously the fixtures with Rogers but Smith row keeps finding a way to get in in bench maybe I should tell you the bench Rogers because the inevitable will happen if you do I mean surely there's a double figure return coming for Rogers that's what I'm thinking that's what I'm thinking and Smith R is Gonna Keep ticking along but I'm still trying to hit that that double digit for Rogers yeah well I haven't got that dilemma I'm gonna I'm gonna start him um yeah but um I would start Rogers myself but yeah he's currently he's currently starting so yeah we'll see uh and the only play I want to talk about was Bowen um he might be a factor for us in a few weeks maybe he's he's um he's a bit pricey but two two assists and a goal ex9 not great 0.41 he's 54th on the list of all midfielders um I can't believe Antonio is still starting for West Ham surely they've got to change that up and get full Krug in or or get another option I think he I think he is yeah I think he is but they've got they got to get him in as soon as he's fit right because Antonio Antonio shouldn't be playing Premier League level anymore should I mean he's still a bit of a handful but yeah I I agree with you and and I just wonder how is Bing not going to play down the middle eventually I mean well that's what I'm ly doesn't want to go there does he it seems so I don't know I don't know West Ham come yeah I mean what's their fixures like I don't really think they pick up that well they're patchy still aren't they I mean it's a big step to go to Bing I think when ino's about and yeah okay they they are they're not bad but the next two it's where's the Run where's the concentrated run where you're expecting returns United Forest Everton I suppose but yeah I mean he can get go it's now isn't it it's it's if you're going to invest in Bowen it's probably now because you get Chelsea at home brenford ipswitch Spurs man united that's not a bad one but would you go for him over embo who's got Spurs West Ham wolves man united switch probably not um I guess if you're if you're only going for Harland you maybe got a bit more money to to play around but yeah I do like Bowen but like you say I think there's there's probably better options and the fixures aren't good enough to to go there I also think under ly are they a side that are going to let rip and score three or four goals I mean they you know I remember them going to Bright them scoring three and beating you on your own territory and under Moyers every now and then they just had that performance that made you think oh you know what Kudos and B in they could be options but under ly at the moment I don't I haven't seen them take the hand break off and that makes me think you know I don't want to go there at the moment I'd love him to be an option though I mean this is what we need we need those players to come through him so let's hope it happens y uh let's go for some forward in for crog is fit okay Niger well I I can't figure out then answers on post as to why Antonio starting he's flagged he's flagged on on F um's he's got a yellow yellow flag um p n says pet was Bench I think that's because of Brazil right because he was he came back from from that um I expect petta to be straight back in but yeah if if f is fit then surely has to he has to go into the side um forwards I don't think we need to talk about Harland anymore I don't want to talk about pretty decent is they I mean the only to mention here is and and and maybe this is a crme of comfort 73% accuracy and 45% conversion rate he he can't keep that up that's not possible you're gonna be saying that every week to G we I know and and I think I said it last week didn't I I said that you know of all the players this is the one player where you think maybe it can be sustainable because he's he is a machine hence the title of this show this week um but yeah I don't want to spend any more time on Watkins we talked about WIA that's a cool blow obviously got I mean I was never going to play scor and then went off injured yeah he was not going to get in my 11 until gameweek six but I bought him with that I bought him for the immediate game which he got me a return in then I thought I Ben sh for a couple bring it back in six I him for the lovely run probably double up onmo uh here's a question for you with whist out any impact on inmo yeah I think so because they've got such a good partnership haven't they that's that's really evolved over the last over the last couple of Seasons obviously Tony had the ban at the start of last season um they they kind of were forced into that that kind of partnership Tony came back was really ineffective brenford struggled Tony's out again and then bu V both started really well again and he's a really really good player V loads of energy he can finish causes defenses absolutely tons of problems as well um also it lets aumo D drift out right which he's really effective at doing and and kind of coming in from the from the right I wonder if's going have to stay a bit more Central now I what happens D and Sharda Sharda comes in well that's what that's where the smart money is going isn't it and I think that um maybe carvalo could play a could be a factor in this I I I wonder whether car after last night's performance somehow found a place in that team because he's a quality player isn't he I mean yeah yeah so I I don't know whether some system can be built around carvalo as an option by Thomas Frank I just don't know um but at the moment it'll be shardow will start down the middle I guess with with and bumo playing off him and maybe Cal comes in into a Midfield role but um yeah we'll get one I mean this is if you're wild card in Wild Card six I don't know if you'll have enough information to make a decision on brenford in terms of is vandenbberg an option is sharder an option is Cavalia an option maybe we need a bit more data before we can commit but I guess you can move to them when it sorts itself out there's no doubt though the brenford run is so strong that you want get on it though right is Sher an option at 54 in Midfield yeah I I think so I think that if you're brave and you commit the Wild Card this week or next then it's worth going for I think because so the fixes is just so good I mean he's not a prolific goal scorer he's not really a central striker in my opinion two goals is the most the most he's ever had in the league it could be worth going for because I think that you know it'd be nice I think you can take a risk on a couple of of of gambles and how big a gamble would it be because I think he will start and I think he'll start down the middle for a team with good fixture so I like it I like the idea of it yeah you're getting a 54 out position midfielder with let's say let's say you wild C in six with West Ham and Wolves at home they're Manchester United and ipswitch if you're going to take a punt on someone and then you know move off a highly owned player like Smith row even Rogers um someone like that then he might be someone to to consider Kevin sharder look at I was talking about him uh xery I was impressed with he's fourth on the on the list he how he didn't come away with a return against Southampton I I don't know he he looked really Lively and and interesting but again I'm not sure we're going to be risky I mean how much is he in in fbl is he about six million six and a half he he was he started his season at seven million I I he didn't turn up with the reputation as a prolific goal scorer he's more um you know he plays he play a role in the buildup he's he's somewhat creative as well and I think that you know hland is the goal scorer um and zeri is just a different option and I think we can see that right I don't I don't think he's going to attt investment when there's Midfield options from United that's the problem yeah I it was one of those games all right I saw the highlights of it and it's just every highlight seemed to feature Zury in some way it was you know we don't fully trust him yet but he's someone who might emerge for us a bit later in the season um he's someone I've now put on my radar when I hadn't really thought about it but maybe it was just the kind of like Southampton effect and you know we need to kind of be a bit uh you know be a bit bit bit less warm on it um anyone else you want to talk about here was well every time we got to talk about we've got to talk about calv lein Dr David yeah 1963 he's very very popular 5.9 million I'm seeing loads of transfers in for him uh just to come back to the fixtures again I mean the fixtures for Everton are unbelievable B Leicester Crystal Palace Newcastle both at home IP switch Fulham Southampton West Ham brenford man united wolves that's right up to gameweek 15 don't play any top six teams until game we 15 yeah it's crazy isn't it and and they will have to score goals and to be honest like in attacking terms they have had spells long spells in games where they've looked convincing I mean him and McNeil um there is no reason why you you shouldn't consider them with that run of fixtures I mean McNeil I don't think we touched on in midfielders he's 54 I believe and so could be an alternative in that no players created more chances in the league 17 chances yeah yeah so those two we should talk about them my only fear is obviously the levels of confidence in the Everton camp and how long is it before it starts to tell on the output of the attackers as well um c l on pens as well though so it sound I mean you know we're scratching round at the moment are we with the Visa injury that does seem to be the most obvious replacement Chris Wood could be as well though because I do think obviously Forest to grow in as a force and we've got decent fixtures and you know he could score you were you were last week yeah why not in that bracket and the other player to mention is inia because I do think he's 5'9 um maybe if you don't have eza it's an option I don't know if I double up on ezza and and CER but United and Everton I think it's only he got his first goal for the club last night it's only a matter of time before he scores in the league so he's another option so there are there are choices there to move Visa out to Evan nilson as well maybe in that bracket too yep none of them none of them are really go-tos none of them are obvious and maybe calv L is the most obvious because of what we know in the past and the fixtures so yeah I'm I'm behind it but I think if I was wild carding I'd probably look to probably go with Watkins and Harland and a four five probably if is what I do I don't know if I'd go fre Strikers yeah I mean I think I still think J Pedro is the one if he's if he's fit 5 five I still think that's you know incredible value obviously there's a moon is problem for a lot of people who who started with him after his what 40 shots and and no goal um of all the players we've talked about today you know you can have patience with players and I mean Seb still got in kungu so you never know what what might happen but Moes is the obvious sale for me if you've got him because yeah him has came in and scored and you have got options now you know to move you could move down to caval you could move to vardy um for example you could move to Pedro if you haven't got him Evan nson like you mentioned there were options around that that bracket so if you've got moones I think that's quite a quite an easy sell um if I had mes I'd be taking a pun on cavalon although he's is ill at the moment yeah that's it the thing is with c as well it's the fitness isn't it is he just finds a way of breaking down and so you can look at that fix run and think well he's going to be great for that fix run but you cannot take anything for gron with his Fitness because we've seen it year after year haven't we yeah dap's going to be an option for us at some point this season I I I really like him I really really like him and when I switch gets some slightly better fixtures I think he's gonna start scoring some some goals I reckon he'll get I'm gonna I'm gonna go optimistic I'm say he gets 12 goals this season what for C lein no deap dap maybe but between 10 and 12 goals maybe get double F it's very difficult for a promoted Striker to get double figures but you you really rate him do you I like him I like him I thought was built was buil as the as the goal scorer maybe but dap may be more as a battering R but yeah maybe I mean he's looking very direct he's got a lot of threat pace and strength so it's whereever it's which can make the most of the better fixtures but um I think between eight and 10 might be ambitious yeah minutes minutes are a bit of a concern as well because he was again he was subbed early against Brighton um just a lot just a lot to like about him uh right anything else on forwards we move on no I will say that the data has been wrong tonight um so it has been spotted in chat and I spotted it as we go so the xgi column is not correct so I don't know what's gone wrong with that so apologies and I will post the proper calculations post podcast um so sumit's gone wrong in the calculations they look right no they're not there's no way harland's got 2.28 xgi non penalty per 90 right so something's gone wrong there so I mean the the the order is right in terms of probably the xgi tally but not the totals in that column it's not been right for any of the table so apologies for that oversight very difficult very very difficult to get it right after work sometimes when you when you've got up against it so I will check them and put um new tables out on Twitter post release to get when I say they look right I mean like they look logical like none of them look they look logical but the numbers aren't right the calculations so something's gone wrong in the XL calculation so yeah I've been spotting it all night thinking that can't be right and it's been spotted in chat as well so apologies for that um but I don't think anything's misleading I think like the order of the players is probably AB that's what I mean yeah and obviously the other data is it's just the XG non penalty per 90 column I don't know what's gone wrong I need to look at it so apologies for that Nigel he's fuming yeah on mute oh no Mark's gone to beat up Nigel poor Nigel he doesn't he doesn't deserve that uh that's it for forwards while Mark is gone I just want to talk about sleeper who obviously the sponsor of Black Box uh this season um interesting one this this time out if anyone listening to this is uh looking at becoming a form of content creator for their club or has any interest in making social media posts making videos doing all that kind of thing s actually got a paid opportunity to do that it's called the 12 voice there's a link in the description uh into this video and essentially you can fill out an entry form um you can send over to sleeper and they're looking for people or fans who are of clubs uh to do social media posts uh to um to do videos to do all different content around around their own their own club I debated entering it for Brighton and then thought I'm already doing enough cont know you're the same Mark yeah there's no way I'm doing because obviously I do Forest Focus as well and Planet fbl correspondent um but yeah it's really good and we'll see we'll see who comes forward hopefully some of the FPL Community volunteer for that because it'd be really good to see some of the some of the names representing their clubs I mean we know there really knowledgeable people out there for their Club so let's see who comes forward so yeah and is like as I said I did the forest um pod you know talking about Brighton and talking M about the match up and you know if you if you know a bit about about your about your Club there's nothing better than just getting a platform to talk about them and you know talk about your views and and things so yeah give it um have a look at the link fill out the application if you're interested and you might be the next content creator uh for your for your club uh let's take a look at some fixtures then this is our predictions for the week coming up they all pretty similar again Mark we're getting a bit I know I not too bit too similar with these I think you moved the uh You' moved the garden center game from forest Brighton up to West H I think you're probably right I know well I believe you made the garden center game Forest I was take that went straight off when I saw that no chance I I I do think the uh yeah the the West Ham Chelsea game is probably the better option I'll give you that yeah well we'll start with them we start with West Ham Chelsea they are the garden center game I'm keep that logo on for the whole whole time we're talking about it I might just move over a bit because it's a bit not Center it annoys me hang on um but yeah what would you make of this I mean I this is one of the few ones we've gone different I've gone for um a West Ham win uh in this one I Bournemouth I don't know how Bournemouth lost that game to Chelsea it was a real kind of dingdong of a match yeah I mean 14 bookings 14 yellows I I was like and it wasn't really a filthy game it was like little niggly fouls but I mean he just it just ran away with him full te bookings and it did take the edge off it it was a horrible game to watch um Palmer I was watching throughout thinking come on come on convince me convince me I need pay attention of you and no just wasn't there yeah and Chelsea very much a work in progress managed to get through it a bit of quality Bournemouth again were unlucky not to get more from the game um and I thought they deserved at least a point from it so Chelsea Smash and grab a bit really and kungu ironically Off the Bench and I don't know I I don't know what to make of Chelsea how long is it going to take before we start in them I think it's going to be weeks yet isn't it yeah I mean the player I was most most impress with Sancho when he came on I thought that is that is what Manchester United have been crying out for ever since you signed and I haven't seen any performances from him in the Manchester United shirt like like the 45 minutes he put in for for Chelsea um for his really quick feet really direct creating loads of chances Defenders couldn't get near him half the time so been to see if he can if he can nail down a a spot in the team but did you hear him after the match uh it was moresa talking about he's like I've said to enu and and Mada and Sancho and just listing all these players and none of them are guaranteed like Jesus Christ 12 players you've listed mentioned ju Hall who hasn't got a sniff either and it's like it's it's got to be a bit of a mess isn't it I mean mesa's probably G obviously got to put a front on but it's it's horrible and and I just hope Palmer can come through it and be what we need him to be because he's a and I love him he's a great player and I don't think he'll hit the Heights in next SE last season but hopefully he he can still emerge from the chaos that is there and be an option yeah yeah anyway that's our guarden Center game I've gone for a West Ham when you've gone for a one0 Leicester Everson big game there's two big relegation kind of teams uh two relegation matchups this this week uh I've gone for a Leicester win uh 2-1 you've gone for a two if Leicester do win this D could be packing his bags you think so already well could be I think there's a very real chance they could win it I mean you've gone two1 I've gone two all I think that I can only think as a game of goals I I don't trust I defense I think Evan got enough in attack to cause Leicester problems and you don't need much to cause Everton problems it seems defensively um why are they playing Michael Keane all the time when they've got O'Brien I just don't know I mean that's not helping D's calls because the everon fans can see it and Kean was obviously at fault for the Watkins goal and I don't know and obviously D knows Keane from his Bernie days so is there is there too much faith in him there yeah I think you might be right I mean they're are they're starting to ask questions aren't they but U it depends on the nature of the defeat if they lose two or three nil then yes but yeah yeah squeaky win for Leicester you still hope that D has got enough in the bank to keep his job yeah true uh Liverpool Bournemouth Liverpool looking to bounce back another trip to another trip another trip another game at anfield for them to bounce back against the Bourn side who were going to play very differently to Forest um obviously much less focused on defense I think it's going to be again quite an open game for them which I think will suit Liverpool I've gone for a couple of goals to Bournemouth I've gone for three2 here you've gone for 3-1 yeah I mean what's behind that you just you just think they're going to allow goals all of a sudden I I think the I think the Liverpool defense is strong I think Bournemouth have got a lot going forward and in terms of pace and power they could maybe catch Liverpool so I think they might get one and I've gone 3-1 I think they will bounce back I it's hard to believe with the quality they've got that they won't that they'll fall foul again and and get a a negative result which will be you know a negative result be a draw yeah but I I I do worry I mean like I came out obviously came out the forest win delighted but also concerned that are they going to be our team's going to be able to repeat what Forest did and you know obviously there'd be a lot of teams looking at that and thinking well there's a blueprint there that we can copy and there are possibly teams better equipped than Forest to do it as well so I don't think bfar no I don't think bfar gonna do that no they'll press they'll press and they'll try and use their pressing to win the ball up the field I think that of all the I think I've seen data recently that shows that Bournemouth the bre you had the most success pressing in advanced areas this season so they'll rely on that to try and get them chances and it might it might work but I think Liverpool are good enough to play out of that and catch them so I've gone 31 yep uh you've also gone 3-1 in the Southampton ips switch game we' both gone for an IP switch win you've gone for three goals for IP switch I've gone for two and just the one for for Southampton um again tricky one to to call I just think I've been more impressed with it switch so far despite the fact they've had quite quite tricky games um they're going to be better at keeping it at tight at the bat because SE Hampton are just too a side at times you know trying to play out from the back and if have got that threat up front but three 3-1 would be a real marker for rip switch I think in this in this one yeah I I I just think they've got it in them and I I worry about Southampton um I just is what we thought you know the moment Russell Martin doesn't appear to be changing things up and he tried to go back four against United still got turned over by three goals and I just don't think they're good enough um they've lost Stevens now to a suspension so Howard Bellis will come back in but you know i' look at their defense and just I mean ramsdale has made a difference and will make a difference and will keep that try and keep their goal conceded tally down but I just think he's got to thank this task I don't think defensively they're strong enough and they're exposed I I do like Flyn Downs I think they've got some good players around him but they haven't got enough and and you know I've seen what it takes firsthand to stay up and I look at Southampton and just think I just don't see it I don't think they're strong enough yeah I know it's a bit less important for us now what because you know in previous Seasons when when we known that we're going to Wild Card in in six say um you dead end your team don't you you you you make sure you you use a transfer so you don't lose it whereas you don't lose it this time so you can bank and then and then wild card but if I was Den ending the team this week I think Leaf Davis would be someone that I'd I'd look at because obviously I've got Robinson at home to Newcastle I think Newcastle score in that game uh looking at 4.5 asset I think you could go for one of suara or or or Davis don't mind it going forward Davis prob be the preference yeah definitely I I I do think I'd make it switch the favorites for this game um and yeah both of us have gone for a way win and so if I was going anywhere that' be yeah be that be where I go i' go Leaf Davis but there are there are home games to come that's where it switch and Lea Davis are going to be most effective just faned him because I just think they they've got more about them than sampton and I just worried defensively about sampton yep uh Villa wolves the Midlands Derby I've gone for a 3-1 Villa you've gone for a 2 nil so both expecting it to be relatively routine you never really know what's gonna happen in these these sorts of games though it's just what impact is the European fixtures gonna have on Villa um they put a strong side out obviously last night they won the game how's is that going to impact them but I think the quality they've got and we've talked about the Wolves defense they will win the game it's whether or not wolves can catch them at the other end but we saw Villa's defensive data as being pretty strong so I've gone two nil I think it will be routine yeah so Watkins surely comes away with something from that then you'd hope it depends if he can get it in the first hour L doesn't it get that's a trouble right so yeah yeah good point I think he's a decent Captain option this week because you know you've got you've got obious got the Liverpool Bournemouth game with Salah looking you know so good but there isn't really a lot of other decent options I don't think from because obviously harland's playing Arsenal not really going to go for either of those I wouldn't have thought although if he didn't have Salah I probably would be tempted just to stick it on stick it on Harland but who else is there really maybe son at brenford if you've got him like you do might be an option yeah maybe he comes out well in the in the alos um is is the 60 Minute thing a problem maybe we're putting too much into that 80 he got 80 against against last night yeah yeah 60 okay fair enough so maybe but he got 80 because they were chasing the game though the thing the game state was suggest yeah so I don't know does it put eye off the C I know that James on planet fbl Captain him did well and he matched Highland so maybe you just ignore that and hope that his ex- mins goes up but Duran you can't he's not GNA leave Jan on the bench is he that's the thing so yeah it's a problem but not cameras made the camera's a bit bigger for why not uh fullam Newcastle you've gone for a Newcastle win 2-1 I've gone for a a one all I was quite surprised you went for a Newcastle win as you you've been quite quite down on their performances I just think Barnes will start I think they've got enough in attack and again I think the quality will win out but I yeah I'm not not hopeful of like an eak hall or anything here um I I just want to see them playing with a lot more Rhythm and fluidity and that bit of Verve and you are right Perhaps it is just a c ity gz Jo Linton is there creativity you'd think garez is creative enough but the yeah trippier did bring so much you're absolutely right he was he was such an outlet for them in terms of their buildup play and his delivery was first class and the liento doesn't bring that so is that what they're missing yeah you might be on to something I think what you want to see if you know with liento and and hall or whoever is okay they lose a bit of creativity but are they like a better defensive unit are they more solid I don't really think they are either I think teams still still feel like they're able to to get at them um particularly you know when when they're playing away from home uh so yeah I've gone for a drawing that uh Spurs brenford I've gone for a 3-1 but Spurs are struggling to score goals they're struggling to convert the chances that's do pretty dominant displays against Leicester where they couldn't score dominant display against Arsenal in the first 30 minutes couldn't put the ball away um slanky got 90 minutes but son looks a bit off it Madison hasn't really been performing um yeah I've gone for three but maybe a bit MB hope ful than than logic I think they squeak it I wouldn't be surprised see Bren forgets on it though um and Anie is just like going further and further into despair isn't he with every game oh he was very post match give it a rest please you know um you you've got to be I don't know I I think you you say a lot don't you people you tell a lot about someone's character in adversity and the minute Spurs started struggling his postmatch and his the way he treated his media just went really downhill from what it was I really loved his arrival at Spurs and what he brought and some of the character he showed and some of the things he was saying then he lost all that the minute Spurs started struggling and it's carried on this season he's been so sour um postmatch and don't know why you have to be like that I mean I get it that he's it's a very difficult job to do when You' just lost a game to go in front of the press and the media but other managers manage it right I saw our manager Steve Cooper have to do it every week because we were losing many many games and he never treated a media like that and I know perhaps he's not under the same kind of pressure but there were degrees right and I I don't like it and it makes me think well if he's like that for the cameras and the media which we're all seeing what is he doing behind the scenes that we don't all see you know and you know it's not good it's not good and I'm starting to worry that he's job is isn't n secure because I would never have said this six months ago I thought he was doing a fantastic job and he was the player a manager to take Spurs forward but they're really struggling aren't they and some of the stats coming out now about his win rate and the recent run starting to be worrying so they I think they'll do enough here but an needs to get more from that team there's no doubt yeah I saw I saw quite a good post about him which which said when he first joined a lot of the media treated him almost like a bit of a Ted lasso character you know like he's that kind of Plucky Underdog he's come from Australia he's inherited this team he's going to turn them around and all this and he hasn't he obviously isn't playing up to that or doesn't want to play up to that or whatever because like you say the way he talks to journalist I mean sometimes he did he does get asked some stupid questions um and you know but the way he responds to them I don't think is is a good way of is a good way of responding to them and like you say you talk about Cooper I thought Cooper was very classy the way he responded to to the media um and yeah posu hasn't really got the reputation to be able to get away with the way he talks at times no because pep does it doesn't he pep pep can be a little bit spiky with the press and when he's asked a silly question he makes it known it's a cly question well but you know I just don't I don't it makes you feel uncomfortable and if you support Spurs do you want your manager to be like that do you do you laugh it off or do you start going being a bit of an [ __ ] isn't he yeah yeah it would start to worry you I think because you you think well if he's like that there it's obviously getting to him he hasn't got the resolve to take defeat and take adversity and not let it show in how he comes across and as a leader and as a football manager that's a that's a weakness I would say so yeah it's a it's worrying I think the the way he talks in in terms of you know it's my second season I always win things in my second season look at the stats the way he's defensive about himself you don't tend to see too much you don't you know klopp had his moments where he was a bit of an [ __ ] but it wasn't really in the same defensive way you sort of marinho obviously because he was very very you know Arrogant with with with things and when he got questioned but I haven't really seen that with many other managers um so yeah have to see how he how he turns around it's not a great trait to have is it no it's not I me yeah we've seen it with a bit of slot as well a bit of arrogance you know he said about he's talking about losing to Forest being a disgrace it's like we are yeah that was that was that wasn't great that wasn't a great look yeah um yeah anyway uh Palace man united I've gone for my I'm sure I get slated for this I've gone for a palace win here two1 uh man united one all you you've gone for a draw I was just really impressed with the E and Kea Mata com I really really liked it I think it looks like they've been playing together for you know for years not and ketcher coming in for his first game and I think that's just given them the lift that they needed they've dealt with the Gaye stuff now that's all done results haven't been great but now they've got eneter in and he's giving him that that extra bit which they lost when obviously they lost to lisay um I think they have a little bit too much for Manu in attack they're still B new Defenders few injuries could be right you could be right I think that um it'd be good if that clicks I'm love Eddie I think he's great I wish Forest signed him so I do wish him well there and I think he could click in this game and the first goal is around the corner like I said so um yeah I can see I can see Palace tur them over I think it is the kind of fixtures where you the the the home style end get behind Palace there's a big atmosphere there and they've got goals in them for sure what United can do at the other end um I've gone a draw but maybe sit on the fence I do like the 2-1 next to the big one it's the big one next the Black Box Derby Black Box Derby yeah Chris Phillips says an arrow Brighton win as Phillip says an arrow Brighton win mark suin what a surprise says a forest win yeah I I I don't know I I mean you couldn't score against it witch so why do you think you're going to score against Forest I mean that's what that would be the simple question but I do think we can catch you as well I think we've got some threats and I do I mean you've got threats but the trouble is you know you talk about matoma but we've just seen how well Moro dealt with Salah so I don't necess think Mata is going to be as dangerous to us as as as he can be against other teams so I think defensively our fullbacks are really good in good form and our center backs are great as well we got caught one n at your place with a ridiculous setpiece goal last time out I don't think we'll get caught like that again and I do think going forward we're we're got we got some confidence and some weapons there so I think it'd be a really good game I really hope it is I think it's I think it's going to be a decent game to watch I don't know why I made it the garden center [Music] game I'm in a I'm going to Madrid this week and I know no no we we we we tried to get tickets but yeah it wasn't it wasn't possible I think we we were offered um to to go to Athletico to see Atletico uh play but I'd rather I'd rather see Real Madrid and I don't really want to miss as pathetic as it sounds I don't really want to miss Brighton V Forest I don't really want to miss Man City B Arsenal oh you're gonna watch the games when you're out there oh yeah but you gonna be there with your like noted hany and your Union Jack boxers in a in a pub watching the football no I'll be in my Brighton I'll I'll be full bright Kit full Brighton kit oh God as abroad do I want to know I know yeah it's not not great uh anyway that's the Black Box St that's always a good one Shane we still haven't been to see one in person no we can't do it we got to make sure we get to one and then we can do a vlog when we're there so I think it's February the 1 foresty Brighton right make sure you make it yes definitely we'll get you a seat don't worry we'll do Hospitality as I said we'll get Hospitality in the new you know we've got those new have you seen it the new um container things we've used shipping containers we turn shipping containers into a new hospitality suite it's pretty old it's as good as it sounds right but it's like 300 quid and I'm thinking yeah I'd do that for the Black Box I was about to say as a joke probably with the all owner to be about 300 quid and it say exactly how much he was 300 quid a ticket and I'm like let's give it a go I'm curious as to what it's like what in a match inside a shipping container it attach like a massive crane that like spins around that'd be fun oh it I'll send you pictures it's not pretty I mean there's pictures of what it's going to look like but it doesn't look like that at the moment and um yeah it's in the corner um I I don't really want to sit there but you know for the Black Box stby we should do it for a laugh it' be quite funny okay I'm in sounds good uh final game of the week is Man City V Arsenal we've both gone for an on the fence draw yeah i' come for a nil nil this just both teams don't want to lose nil nil you've got that's it isn't it because it's early in the season and my feeling is that you know arteta will go there and think okay we we're we're rice is back but OD guys still out would he take a draw there you've got to think he would right you've got to think you got to think this is a must not lose for both teams to yeah because it's about it's about the psychology of what that would mean for the winner and so if they're both going to go home thinking you know what it's I must not lose the likely outcome is a nil nil isn't it yeah um I've gone one all I'd like to think there is a goal in it but you could be you could be right if I was picking the fixture that's most likely to be nil nil it would be that one I think I agree um I mean you could maybe argue like sthampton ipswitch as well is a similar kind of must not lose um but I think both teams will mistakes I think yeah I think I switch will fancy the chances against so might attack a bit more um and yeah and obviously mistakes like you mentioned um was it which game was it last season when Arsenal absolutely dominated City and then still managed to lose it was that at the etti had or was that the City Arsenal I don't don't I don't know what I don't know where it was I can't I can't recall I think I think it was at the ettihad I think it was Aral went there and should have won it and ended up losing it and that was ultimately kind of what what cost him the the leag so I mean I'd love if Arsenal got a result I really would and I think it would be good for the premier league as well because I think that the pace at city is setting is already a little bit worry and it's a bit it's bit like I said about fbl it's like we want it we don't want it to be we don't want City to run away with it so the last result we want is a city home win Arsenal out you know push back and then with the odard injury that could impact them and psych psychologically as well losing this game so the best result for the neutral probably would be an Arsenal win yep yep if you want to get involved in the blackbox predictions uh obviously you can you can join our patreon there's still time to get in patreon.com blackbox we've got a website where we track all the predictions of all the members and ourselves uh we predicted 40 uh matches now Mark is currently in the lead but only by two points you get one point for a correct outcome three points for a correct score very close I've got slightly better out comes but you've had uh I think one or two more correct correct scores so there's not much it look at hottin though Ian we talked about him last week crazy 73% correct outcomes blood L is absolutely ridiculous um yeah what is he I mean hopefully I mean I don't want don't wish anyone to gamble but hopefully he makes some money out of his of his predictive Powers because that's crazy yeah yeah um yeah get involved if you're interested in that there still time um also join the sleeper pick him league as well that's correct outcomes uh too and monthly prizes or prizes worth up to £500 a month completely free to play Link in the YouTube description below Al an overall prize for that but yeah obviously get involved in that if you haven't already uh captaincy as I said interesting week uh this week uh Harland is top of all the metrics no surprise but has the hardest game the Daya is wrong in this as well the xgi is still wrong in this by the way we won't mention that we don't need I figured out what I did I figured out what I did by the way um in in my workings I basically added XG to xgi rather than XA to XG so the columns were wrong and that was caused by the cost tab malaky that I spoke to you about so I will correct it I will correct it updated tables so off it won't happen again and I know exactly why it's happened and apologies yeah every week I hear about that cost that cost tab in in Scout it's caus you no end of problems isn't it yeah it's fine it's it's fine I've sorted it now um it it's on on the chart anymore don't worry don't wor yeah it's fine um it's Salah isn't it I mean is there a conversation here around that I mean most managers now have got Salah even with Harland there in their team most have moved that way as well um if you don't Salah you probably would go Harlem wouldn't you let's face it I think it's Watkins Harem Salah that's the three do you Sal what have we got what have we got in The Matrix for this week bring that up let's have a look I think I probably had those three as well son okay so Salah Watkins son yeah I don't know I don't know if we saw enough on son though no I mean you you think his Spurs win son should get a return at of that um because you know he's on pens and he is Central to their attack he's not Central literally because he's playing out left but yeah I think it's it's because of what harland's done so far if you don't have Sal it's it's very difficult not to say that harland's not the second choice right yeah um I mean next week as well you know we haven't got harand highlighted here he he probably is entering into that that bracket but I mean salah's got sack's got Leicester Watkins has got ipswitch again that's a three great yeah you you would think that those three are stronger Captain C options in Harland in a normal EnV situation but it's just what we've seen so far is just ridiculously yeah crazy and then look at that run though look and gameweek seven onwards it's hard to question captain in maybe brighten away but you are definitely going to Captain Harland Fulham wolves santon Bournemouth I would Bri away yeah yeah there you go yeah so this is why the you know I haven't got Harland yet I've got to think about wild cards in in I game week six or certainly game week seven I think because of that run and the Damage he can do in that run is pretty considerable I thought and when where did you go to the captaincy you get to game with Kate and it's a problem yeah I mean this is your team for for the next game week um you mentioned the wild card as well you got that on the on the radar um but yeah let me know your what's your thoughts what you thinking well I think I don't think I do anything this week um I don't necessarily need to un unless I hear obviously isach or xia Pedro are out um because I think that I'm not booking in the the wild card game week six if I was I dead end something into game week six it might be that I'd take two transfers into six and then get Watkins and mumo in for son and wiissa right which I could um and then go without Harland at Newcastle and and hope that sacka covers the captaincy which he could do so I think what I'll do is not I'll probably hold this so it's reyya coner Trent Pedro poo sacka e Salah son Rogers isak and Jal Pedro if that 11 are fit I'll probably just go in with that save the transfer and then decide whether I Wild Card next week and take the extra transfers through or whether I make transfer next week and wild card ahead of seven y but I could I I've looked at Wild Card this week I don't think it's worth it I don't think I want to move to Harlem when he's got Arsenal so it's more likely I do it in six when he's got Newcastle or seven when he he's got Fulham at home I think he's he's probably the likely outcome so I don't really see a transfer here I mean I could do wher to calv lein I've got not one in the bank but then who do I who do I pull out maybe xia Pedro if he's not going to be fit there's talk that he wasn't training today again so um I don't know what you what do you make of that what would you do there yeah I think if there's doubts around lak and and Pedro going into the weekends I think I would probably look to move wher out and have that as a good because you don't really your team no offense isn't looking that strong this week um and you know if G Pedro's gonna miss out and Robinson's gonna come in I'd think I'd much rather have an option of a calv lein or or a vardy in case that was that was going to happen um but yeah it's I mean the thing is the only major difference between my team and other people's is harand playing Arsenal because most most Harland teams have got well they most Harland teams have got Salah but they haven't got sacka so it's only looking I don't don't know I dispute the fact it looks weak because in a all week it would because harland's got GNA score goals but it's not true and there not yeah so I don't think it looks weak because it's as good as any other team the only thing that's missing is Harland playing Arsenal which I don't know you could say well that's a major problem but I'd like to think it isn't because of all the games against Arsenal I would say that that could be the one where I can think well he's only gon to get one goal maximan so I don't think it's weak I think it's okay um but the problem I've got is my differentials are sacka and son and I don't see necessarily see son getting me anything and sacka probably won't do anything either because he's playing City so I don't have anything there that's going to help me make up ground because people have got har got Sol so I might get a green arrow but it's not going to be it's not going to be a game which helps me make up ground so I I accept that but I don't think I'm going to lose ground unless Haren goes crazy Sur which he could I mean this is it he could so I think that yeah it all depends on whether those flags come off I think saaka will be fine because he's playing tonight right so um I think isak's fine because just blur Vision so I don't think that's a problem unless it was concussion and it's xia Pedro really and if yeah if Shia Pedro's out I'm tempted to do it anyway because I don't necessar think Brighton are going to score many goals against that's what I was about to say are you not tell just to get rid of the whistle problem and bring in another cheaper Striker I mean it's caval Zill though isn't he so you've got that yeah so he's flag as well is yeah yeah or it's V or it's who was the other or would bringing bring you bringing in Chris be the ultimate turnaround yeah I I just I just think I'd rather have the two transfers next week and then decide that gives me the option to wild card or not whereas I they use a transfer this week I've kind of got a wild card next week I think yeah yeah that's true because I'd be going s in bumo and having three million in the bank and I don't really want to do that yeah whereas I if I have two transfers I can go s and bumo Wier to Watkins and that is then a team where I can go well maybe I can go about Harlem one more week and and hope that sacka Watkins they they will be differentials I mean or Salah could be a differential because you think that many teams are going to go Salah to sacka don't you so I could have a decent team with two transfers next week that makes me think I haven't necessarily got go Harland but he could destroy Newcastle can he this is the thing he's like it he's dominant and and it's a shame because yeah it does limit our our possibilities a bit now yeah um well I'm I'm in I'm in a similar dilemma of when I'm going to when I'm going to walk card as well cuz I think my team actually is all right for game week six um I probably won't have S well I won't have sacka unless I sell sell but I can get to an Arsenal um Defender so I've got Henderson in goal with Trent porro and Robinson uh Salah Captain jotter Gordon Rogers Harland mateta who was a problem I thought might be a problem for me he's now actually I think quite a good good asset out nowhere and and G Pedro and then I've got Smith row on the bench who can come in if if Pedro is is out um my first thoughts were to were to roll earlier in the week um and then I could do Salah to sacka and tedson to Raya for two threee trans for two free transfers um that means losing Salah against wolves but gets me two Arsenal players at home to it's Southampton first isn't it and then and then Lester yeah which which I like the look of but I am thinking that jotter is a problem so I could do jotter to mumo and then I'd still have the money to do porro to next week yeah next week yeah so I would I would role this I mean you're playing Robinson at home to Newcastle which is probably the only weakness here really um CU if xia Pedro's not fit he got Smith row so there's not there's not any other weakness there I would say other than maybe jotter but we just don't know how that's going to go do we it's he loves him but there there is a threat there now yeah for sure yeah do do I do I give J one more week or do I bring in inoma who I'm going to want anyway from from game week six well you give J this week I think you think I'll give him this week I would because he's G to get a Le Le half an hour yeah true and boomo at Spurs could he could he could do well at Spurs I mean that's the thing it's but yeah I would I would probably hold jota for this week see what happens yeah I I do like the idea of getting Ry in for Henderson because then that gets rid of that goalkeeping problem gets me gets me the the Arsenal Defender who I want the most um selling Salah isn't ideal but I'm getting in saaka who's let's be honest a pretty good replacement with the two home games he's got so yeah but then I'm still on to J so if J's then a problem from from next week then it might be wild card time because that'll be three transfers um and I can get rid of Robinson I can clear up my bench a little bit Yeah you got Johnson there when are you gonna play it if you don't play it next week I know so it could it could and and I like the fact that I could I can keep the two three transfers and still play it now and still keep those two three transfers was obviously in previous years I'd be decid you know I'd need to make a transfer this week and then then wocks I couldn't hold and then and then wild card so um oh it's Leicester before Southampton first so it's a slightly you know not it's the slightly worst game of it two but yeah still still pretty good I'm probably Gonna Roll anyway both us rolling brilliant both us rolling fun all that all that all that analysis and yeah we're both uh we're both rolling um that's pretty much it from us we've got a couple of super chats uh to answer it uh we've got this is just um a message from super duper FC who's been a member for 30 months of the YouTube channel uh thank you very much he says Yellen and Mark's Vlogs are the weekly entertainment yellers are good I really like some of her transition she uses very clever she's got lots of ideas and um yeah it's good it's good I mean I I enjoy doing I think like we both got the same camera aren't we so we both use the same God she loves it she hasn't got the Drone though yeah I've invested in a little drone to help me do the the GTA type shots behind me which is is kind of cool um but yeah so I'll be doing it I've got to find a spot in Brighton on Sunday morning so I'm looking forward to doing it in Brighton see where I can do didn't have she didn't have any time when she went because we were so late so so there's no footage oh God no it's the only thing about it is it means I spend Monday night editing the video which means Tuesday night I'm rushing doing the data and then I get the XG data wrong so that's my fault so I need to sort I keep say teach me how to do the tables and I can help out but yeah I know I know we'll sort out so I that's rattled me tonight getting that wrong because it's the first time it's happened I don't think we've ever had the data wrong like that so apologies I will get correct we have oh thanks very much because you were rattled then it's very rare don't get me wrong but it has it has Fair it's it's Exel it's so easy to break yeah it is y uh new member atab boy thank you very much new member Nigel the crab don't really understand that left and joined again oh left and joined that's a understandable uh heroic doses thank you very much for the super chat um I get the rule but triple sub oh yeah here we go triple sub 5920 jotter gets one because he's off first Diaz gets three because he's off at 605 imagine they were Defenders FBO equals a clown show it is a ridiculous rule ridiculous I I think it should be when the ball goes up that's the minute 100% 100% because then it then it's about like who walks the quickest or who who furthest I was saying to pra well that's great great um marginal game because Diaz is obviously on the wing so therefore Jos has willing the sh distance but it shouldn't come down to that should it it's absolutely crazy did someone say it's just poor like x x steps or x x grass or something yeah um yeah I mean that's you're right I mean the swing for a Defender would have been massive wouldn't it and um yeah I mean like imagine Trent and Robertson and Robertson is over there and Trent's nearest so Trent goes off sooner Robertson makes it a bit of a distance and he gets a clean sheet that it could happened because he he's taken them both off he took them both off at his didn't he I think at the end yeah he did so you know it you know I mean they wouldn't go off on 60 Minutes maybe but it is still a very silly rule so do it when the ball comes up not when the player steps over the line it's yeah got I mean I I've won I've won two leagues in the past by one point one against you and one when I was in the cash League years ago I know that's the point that's the two points yeah and I was robbed of that because of the edit an assist did you have to bring that up again I thought that was awful on Saturday no harand got that second goal and I thought oh who got the assist bloody Edison of all they rubbing it in they gave it straight away as well Ming around no doubt yeah course maliky Fox thank you very much hi as a Mark Jackson to calv lein for a hit not for a hit no I'd keep I wouldn't want Jackson particularly but if you've got him I'd keep him not for a hit yeah I I just don't think I mean like I said the dcla gets the fitness it's um yeah longterm I worry about him getting match after match after match and so um I think he's good for a couple of weeks um but as you know he's ear already so what's behind that you know I want to you need to get a bit of that before you know for sure but it's the hit it's the Four Points you you you're putting pressure on to score one straight away which he's not that prolific that you can do that yep no I agree not for me uh and the final one is from P Lassen again thank you for the Super Chat should I do vardy to wood or hold wood longterm I guess it means wood to vardy or hold W no I'd keep wood yeah so I um I think that aan is still some time away from being the starter and um I think wood can cause you a few problems and um yeah we'll create for him he's not brilliant in the buildup but he's there to finish things and we'll create for him and we' got some good fixtures to come so hold him for sure y uh at boy says like the stream Lads and gals is a small effort but for as Mark very helpful y if you haven't liked already do give us a like do drop us a comment yeah and if you are listening on podcast give us a festar review if you've enjoyed it because again those this is the place I'm reliable XG data so where else would you rather be than watching two men talk about wrong XG days some Grand people moaning that fbl is broken because he had a bad game week that's what you want right that's it yeah well I don't really like your team this week so I don't think you're going to be that happy next week thanks a lot I don't know I don't understand who what team looks much better than that I mean yeah mil it sorry yeah I I don't think it's no I mean Watkins maybe could go off um yeah I know to be fair is I don't think it's going to be a very high score scoring week so you you'll probably get away with that no probably not I mean yeah it depends how that Arsenal City game goes doesn't it because we are reliant on those assets really reliant on those assets um you know without Ry and sakur have done really awfully without harand lot of managers would have done awfully so it shows you how alarm we've become on Arsenal and City already this season so um we'll see I I think Salah will come good I think I think there'll be points in that game for everyone who's on Salah um but um I'm not holding my breath for summer returns but we'll see stranger things have happened they have yeah well and I would say good luck in the black boox Derby but I don't mean it get um I will be messaging you um so make sure you get your phone sorted out in Madrid because I want to be able to send you photos on the ground of us celebrating [Music] and I wish we go together good game yeah a good game nice that it's getting closer between the two teams because when we came up the the thought of sharing the match with you watching Forest getting beaten but now I think actually by the time we actually get to it like you come to the city ground I think that's going to be really I think it's tight now between our teams so yes do I I am proud that Forest have made progress and closed the Gap a bit and you never know you made the Europa League maybe we can maybe we're not too far away either we'll see yeah I think Matt said to me where do we think we finished and I said probably like ninth and 10th it's probably realistic good good yeah be right with that Mark absolute pleasure as always I'll see you again next week enjoy the game well I hope so unless I have another miserable game week then I might retire and uh oh no don't say that have to do it bloody handy kind of that this all good yeah it's all good thanks right I'll see you again good night for me night everyone

fuzziness that are on screen then but well move on to fbl now no ones saying anything about the fuzziness is fun this thing is fun lets talk about game week four then lets start with you im sure youre desperate to talk i cant see it as sorry thats far too fuzzy i cant make it out you panic me then for a second2 points de i read for it ry nine points thank god for rya trent one coner one lewis one robinson 2 i know its w all over again sacka 7 rogers 2 e2 is my transfer in for smith row who did better than eza salah with the fail the captain se on four son two isak one off at half time of course so a lot of teams were popped up by harland i dont have harland so i couldnt be popped up by that salah blanked for the first time this season so what are you going to get when harand returns and salah blanks and you havent got harland youre going to get a bad game week luckily sacka and reyer came in for me i i know and there were a lot of teams who had like the 26 points from harland and then blanks everywhere else wasnt there there were some crazy looking teams this week in that respect and why did so many players blank it was just it was just a very odd game week in that respect and harland papered over the cracks for a lot of managers i watched the forest liverpool game live dont ask me how because i wasnt there i did turn down a ticket to go as well this is terrible what would you do in my shoes here so i had a friend who i met at forest text me on friday night and he said if i can get you a ticket do you want one and i thought to myself well im going to brighton next week this week and im going to fulham the week after i cant go into pip and say what do you think can i go to liverpool and then go next week to the brighton game and then the week after the full i thought shes not going to let me go to three games and i thought to myself whats the chances of us getting some at liverpool itd be a good nice to go up there and that i thought no so i dm him back said thanks for the offer but i better not i better do family stuff better not push my luck what happens the best away day in the history of like there were people on the forest focus pod that i do share with saying the best a day in memory and im like my god so what would you do would you go into pip and look at that look at the sacrifice i made i could have gone but i didnt even ask you cuz thats the guy i am or should i just forget it and leave it or should i bring it up in an argument in a few years time what you mark i know i know you and i know how much pit puts up with you i would i would strongly advise you do abs answer i wanted that is i thought i thought i deserve credit for that but im getting no credit and ive missed the best away day in forest history the thing is imagine if you taken it and got all the way up there and then you got thrash 30 but that was the more pretty big gamble it was and as big as going without harand and cin c in the first place anyway yes so luckily i got through the weekend boyed by the the victory at anfield and then it started to sink in as the hours passed that i had a miserable game week there were teams there were teams worse off than mine and ive just got to take it but now what im more down about is the way its going in the weve got palmer who struggled weve got sackos now got odard missing for probably a long time based on what we heard tonight is that doesnt sound great so weve got to assess is sacka gna be the sacker of last season now with oard missing for a long period of time probably not were still g to get him for the two home games but after that how long whats the impact of the odard injury on sacka watkins has done okay showed up last week so he could be an option but palmer sacka son i dont see them i dont see them justifying their price at the moment and i fear i thought sacka would but i wonder now so im fear that what were ending up with even though we started the season going theres so much choice there dilemas and everyones got different teams i fe were going to end up with salah and harland in all our teams two defenders and a load of four fes i do worry i do worry do you not think thats the way its going to go im not as im not as worried as about that because i think were were seeing in game week six were going to see people getting rid of salah and for the sacker home games and so what you think that in game week eight people are gonna go back to salah again i dont think i dont know and i think if youve got two arsenal defenders and trent and harland youre going to find it a bit different because were looking at players like boo you cant do that as well i dont know i think its i think we are i think game week six is going to be interesting because i think were going to see people move towards a lot of the same teams i think everyones team is going to be very similar in game week six and game we seven theres going to be a few people that because i cant i cant have sacka and salah for example game week six i dont think many can so well you cant your wild card to that you can probably walk to it what a harand sacka salah and trent and well you cant have two ar defenders as well no you cant have two ar defenders as well no so youd have to have but you can wild card to saaka salah trent and harland ive tried it ive looked you can i dont think im gonna be going with salah from game week im gonna wild card in either six or seven and id be surprised if my team ended up with seller in it so no it wont then but i think what will happen is well get sacka in for the two home games and then well start to see that arsenal perhaps a much more defensive team rather than a forward thinking team without odard and well start to think or maybe we dont need sacka maybe we go have it up top and that covers arsenal i just fear that the options that we we were giddy about this looks amazing harlands 15m so not everyones goingon to get him well thats going to go pair shaped and weve got other options like palmer and sacka and son and watkins and you cant have them all but i think already i feel like the pool is narrowing a bit what we need what we need is palmer to start pulling his finger out right that will that will cure it but i dont know i watched chelsea and i think i dont see it happening do you see it happening yet well on the on the big screen is the is the is the is the fixtures so the long the longterm view so lets assume game week six is going to be split a lot of people wont want to sell salah for wolves away but some people might have they w i think that might help and then liverpool have crystal palace chelsea arsenal brighton aston villa then its southampton in 12 but then its straight into man city and then newcastle away i dont think people are going to be moving back to salah for that run the only thing because this is the other thing thats going to be d is if people dont move back to salah because they just go well im only going to captain harand now and thats the how close are we to that after four weeks were going to look at harand start its absolut ridiculous after four weeks how close are we to perac cat in harland do you think were not going to get it this week because hes at arsenal but then i reckon even newcastle way i think were going to get people going id rather captain harland than captain sacka at home so i think even then were going to get question marks over do you do you not captain in harland even when sacas got plum fixtures so right i me man citys fixures from six and newcastle fulham wolf southampton bournemouth brighton tottenham youre going to cap him in all of those i imagine unless you go for the sacker option at leicester and southampton but then youre not and then its liverpool away in 13 but thats salah and harlem i know i know arsenal got west ham away spurs have got fulham at home that week so a son or salanki possibly son i just i dont know son out wide to me i own him and i from what ive seen he got me a couple of goals in game week two but i dont see him justifying that p st at the moment well see he might surprise us at home to brenford playing out wide but we know out wide hes not as effective as an asset i just think that already i feel because harlands just been ridiculous incredible right and we all thought 15m was a price tag to make people think well it probably isnt anymore is its not like hes 15 what hes three now and no ones going to blink at that so thats a shame straight away because hes been going to come the dominant heavy hitter and hes going to become the perma captain and so those two things straight away are going to start narrowing the difference between teams and then itll be whether or not you feel like having salah can you justify if you dont captain him or do you go sacka but i worry about the odard impact on sacka what we need is palmer and son to show that they can be justified at 10m and we need foden back to at least present some alternative to harlem we havent got that so its not been fbl did all they could with the pricing dont get me wrong i think they did well with that but unfortunately the way the season has started it hasnt lent itself to everyone having different teams yet i think its pushing people towards well youve got to have harland you might as well catch them every week theres question marks over having sal if you dont captain him question marks over sacka palmers not ready sons not good enough fodens not in the team that suddenly the pool is contracting its like thats not what i expected not what i wanted so its annoying me a little bit its the other way around to what we were expecting because we thought maybe with palmer and sacka competing with each other it would give you the option but theyre not competing with harland and salah at the moment so why would you go there what we need at the moment is for palmer sa to be competing with like lis diaz and th those types of players because theyre the ones where were were moving around salah and har at the moment going anywhere fodens the big one i think when come back and start hitting anywhere near the form he showed last season i think thats when people might but hes not in the starting lineup tonight again is he i thought he might be saved for europe but no the other thing is we need harand to stop scoring loads of goals but well heres anyway here my team im a lot less grumpy than you are had a okay week 59 points for me henderson in goal porro robinson and trent that was a disaster robinson conceding to a 95th minute danny in equalizer is just absolute peak fpl i bought in salah and pedro didnt play salah blanked i got smith row off the bench though and i tell you what i was worried going into sunday because i sold esack and sacka and when sacka got that assist and i still had esat left i thought i could be on the back of about a 20 25 point swing here but with smith coming off my bench i was about i was one point up on that move so one point up were you i thought you were still down on it okay because isac only got the one point didnt he he hea with the one sacka with seven smith row matched him and then sal with two its crazy is it look at your team right they obvious got mata but you only got two players a turn mata and smith row and smith row was on your bench so its was like so many teams just had either harland and one return or thats about it was i mea was a big differential for you so well done but took over as well luy lucky that happened cuz penalty in the in the 9th minute i just would have assumed a would have taken it and was the player i was fearing this week so very lucky with that im disappointed in rogers gordon and jotter all blanking would waker rogers its crazy and he played well last night as well and people are saying like is he is he gonna go on this ridiculous run of looking like the best player on the pitch in every game and not getting any returns and it is it is crazy its got to happen soon isnt it and theyve still got good fixtures left so youve got to hope that its going to drop for him soon but then the jan thing is all very weird i just dont know what they do again watkins subbed on 60 minutes last night little bit of on his leg i think hes all right hell start itll start the weekend but what does emory do with duran because durans like a immovable object at the moment you got to give him minutes havent you and were not just talking five and 10 youve got to give him a decent 2025 so i dont know does watkins come off every game and thats the only way or does he get can he get morgan rogers out wide and duran in with watkins does that even work i dont know i dont know because is playing well ramsays playing well durans playing well watkins isnt going anywhere its very tricky to know what i assume duran would start yesterday and against young boys i know it was their first champions league game in forever but i thought why not why not see i was i was quite surprised to see rogers play he got the 90 again didnt he last night rogers as well dont think he he did czy i didnt expect him to play i thought duran would start rogers wouldnt start but he just seems to youre quite right he loves rogers hes playing superbly but hes just not returning for us and i just dont know theyve got the caribo cup tie so we got to think that duran will start that so maybe that means that he doesnt have a big impact on watkins minutes at the weekend you cant bank on it i think what thats it i said that watkins is back and watkins is an option but if hes hes only ever played an hour so far in every game so like a we invest in a player thats only getting an hour because weve said before you want your striker on for stoppage time because we know the xg goes up around that period so its thats not great either is it so its like i dont know apart from harland and well see salahs had his best start to the season for a long time as well the other second tier assets just i dont know they need to do more they need to do more to make the season what we thought it would be and even jot for example j was my way about going against salah and that just hasnt and im worried about his potential to start because i thought gakpo played quite well yesterday and diaz is getting 60 70 minutes in the league almost every week as well thats not being talked about but hes hes not playing anywhere near 90 you see the comments as well from slot saying he was gonna play gakpo as well but he was tired from his min diaz flying around the world i know and jotter i dont know you talked about it last week didnt you is he is he in the firmino role and like did you see i dont know whether you saw j had hardly got the touch of the ball against for us like we shut him down completely and they just couldnt get the ball anywhere near him and apart from the one chance he did have their best chance but he was so quiet like he was just not a factor at all and so the system that slot is playing although it has got the best out of diaz and weve seen him step up ive never seen jotter have less impact than im seeing hes not playing a part in the buildup and theyre not getting theyre not getting supply to him so thats that is a worry because how long is it before gapo becomes a factor in the middle down the middle or even dare i say it darwin nunes i dont think darwin nunes is i think darwin isnt worry gone hes gone hes gone but thats one good thing to come from this season so far because we dont want any of that darwin had come off the bench and started making a bit of a case for himself i think there would be people going there but luckily its its not us gr and the goods on the screen lots of red arrows this week as you can see pra and harry both leading the way both on a red im on a green im one of four managers in the great and the good on a on a green i said i would id be happy with staying about where i was which was about 900k got a green up to 636 okay so im approaching my best rank in the last two seasons which was about 400000 last year its got to be one of your best starts for a while isnt it i think it probably is i think it probably is my best start for a while yes hopefully can build on that not so good for you we were neck and neck and now theres a what a 30 point difference between us im trying to remember the last time we did a 23 points when was the last time we did a black box where you were beating me the last episode of the end of the season one by one point i think i was beating you every week last season no i was beating you at one point because you ben to super nan right that was game week two that was the mat challenge so like youre beating me by 20 points thats thats the biggest evidence that f is broken of course right regardless of everything else ive said the fact youll beating me by 20 fbl is broken its gone gs gone late r exactly the same points48 i know and exact their teams are similar and theyve got harland like look at the start theyve had and theyve got harand so and i think they had harland from the start didnt they so like harlands not the silver bullet youve got to have a decent team around him as well and a lot of managers i think all the managers above me have got harland and salah now ready for ready for the forest game ironically a lot of people got him in for the forest game and and the games at bournemouth to come next week of this week of course so salahs not a differential for me anymore ive got to hope that son or sacka get me summit this week and then with odard out and sacka at man city probably not going to happen is it so i dont know i were talk about what im doing at the end of the show but its a grim read this even though theres a lot of harland ownership there a lot of red well shout out to seb who has got the same points as zar and late riser but hasnt made any transfers at all this season hes hes committed to this getting as many transfers stored as he can isnt he y and he got inu off the bench this week imagine making no transfers and still having inu if you are struggling if you are in the millions dont worry if you look at the table on the bottom youll be able to see that this season if you look at the great and the good average positions at this point this is the worst start the great and the good have had so i remember 22 23 that was a difficult season the average rank at this stage was 14m the average rank at this season is 2m look at it look at it in 2122 2 wow so at this stage we the average was 240k so almost every manager in the great good had a incredible start is that right wow okay i know no isnt it and team value is the lowest its been in the last four years 1005 its the transfers are about the same hit are about the same but those gw one teams just like you say havent performed and i think if you if you had harland and reyer you probably had a decen start to the season if you didnt have either of those then youre probably two or three million thats probably about how it how is right nothing wrong with being two or three million as nothing wrong with i looked back last year and i was 31m this time last year so just outside the top 10k right but i dont know i didnt enjoy last season at all despite getting 12k and a good rank i thought it was the most tedious season ever so im more im more about like is this going to be a season where its going to be twists and turns and it looked like it was going to be and i dont know i sound like a broken record and maybe its all going to perk up a bit in a few weeks maybe this week its going to turn it around sacka goes and gets a couple of goals and sun looks amazing and palmer comes good and all of a sudden everyone wants i hope so no we dont want that we dont we dont need any more of that as were about to see in a minute well well see right now so this these tables these tables are the are the starts after four game weeks the top 10 in terms of points per start so harland has led the way in each of the last three seasons after game week four he got six goals in four games last season he had six goals in four games the season before that hes got nine goals in four games this time out his points per start is 135 which is the highest probably the highest weve ever seen right it is it is there cant be players had nine in nine and four and its also officially his best four run of four game weeks hes ever had in those three seasons as well so hes beaten his personal best for that span of game weeks and hes beaten his best start ever this highlights what a strong starter we all is and fine we knew that but wow even pep said didnt he that hes surprised at what hes seen from him and its interesting isnt it that salah and holland are the top two and we were all saying before the season started well theyve had a rest theyve had the summer off and you can say its down to that it may not be but it probably was a factor in that theyre the two top scores salah on 43 points i think thats his best ever start as well i had to look at his past seasons and the scout data doesnt unfortunately have fb points right the way back to 2021 but his previous best in the last five years has been 38 points so he has he has had an incredible start as well for his by his standards he wasnt in the top 10 last season or the top 10 the season before i think he got 23 points last season at this stage and 25 the season before so hes almost doubled well not quite but hes you hes added 18 points onto last seasons tally at this stage that is amazing is it for a player as well in the last year of their contract getting on a bit in the league with all the competition around him with j with diaz with all these other amazing players and hes still 10 point 108 without harland that would be the best start freddy player in the last three years for sah but because harlands there its its equipped it diaz is on the list points of 88 that would put him that would also put him second i think to in the last two years thatd be higher than ino last year we rodrigos amazing star god i remember that i didnt get any of those any of those points but a great start for him got a shout out gabrielle and rea though i went into this with no arsenal defense whatsoever i thought games against brian games against villa game against spurs i could make do without a defender and try and get to six without one rey has just been unbelievable and the only other goalkeeper who features on his top 10 in the last three seasons amazingly is dean henderson i know forest and the irony of that because hes been bloody awful for people and ive got him in my team im looking at r who i want and looking at henderson thinking dear hes taunting you there because he saved a penalty for forest as well didnt he 22 in four games show you how difficult it is for a keeper to get in this top 10 its like hendersons in there because of a pen save and 22 saves so thats an incredible return of saves in terms of save points as well we would never expect ry to have 15 saves by now would we wouldnt expect him to have three clean sheets and 15 saves we might expect to have three clean sheets and five saves but not 15 and because hes got 15 saves hes also picked up six bonus points which again i dont know did he even get that many bonus points last season for the entirety of the season ill g have a look because gabrielle and c only got about six all season last season r got six bonus points there he go so hes already leveled his bonus points tally for last season in four game weeks thats and yet we were saying start of the season well you can forget bonus points for keepers well we were saying forget bonus points for keepers if they concede even if they make like 11 saves theyre not getting a bonus but it does look like if a goalkeeper keeps a clean sheet they are very likely to get at least one bonus point and he is they will get the most clean sheets this season but i would say hes in a team where because the other factors is shots on target and fouls one and perhaps arsenal havent done enough in those in those metrics to rival him and knock him out the bps like theyre not full of players who are having loads of shots and so well get to the attacking data later i dont think arsenal are in the top three or four teams there so perhaps and with oard out perhaps theyre not going to be maybe theyre gonna have to rely on winning games one on two nil but it works so why not shout out to mumo on here who is ninth on the list for this season with his two goals against southampton is his goal before that he was second last year after that great run before he had and that might be the move i look to do in that j to mumo move which is maybe a bit a bit earlier than i would have liked but might be might be sensible because he clearly gets off to good starts so want to one to monitor lets take a look at some team data then lets start with team data defense not huge amounts of changes from when we talked about this last week we got liverpool at the top then man city and then forest and i think talk to us about forest how on earth did they stop liverpool well i think that in ana and and moreno weve got th those two on anfield were absolutely fantastic the two of the best fullback performances ive seen from a forest team not just moreno he made six he won six of his seven tackles against salah didnt get much out of him at all and i knew at half time i was saying i think i tweeted i said i dont i just dont see sah getting anything because were just throttling them and every time salah gets anywhere near the ball morenos on him we were so aggressive we were right in their face and m movic and melo are just a great combination murillo very mobile low center of gravity milinkovic a bit of a brute strong in the air strong in the air and a leader so those two and the two fullbacks look it looks like a good defensive unit so i do think that we were top five for defensive data last season i think or top six but we didnt we didnt turn into clean sheets i think we kept one didnt we i dont know i think one or two clean sheets is all we got i think this season though is different because the whole season i think we only kept a couple of clean sheets all season it was pretty bad i think that this season though we will weve weve solved the setpiece issue with melan kovic there and i just think were growing as a team and were going to get more clean sheets and suddenly as a im probably opposite to you i dont try and talk up forest too much because i know that what are you implying what are you implying i know that as fbo assets theyre not i wouldnt advise going there right gibbs white maybe at the start of season i was pushing him but i wasnt wasnt talking about our defense even though the data was good last season but having watched that i do think that moreno at 44 oreno at 44 both of them at 44 good prospects good because i think we are going to go we havent we didnt concede at southampton we havent conceded at liverpool weve won four straightway games now and weve kept clean sheets in the last two were gonna c start keeping clean sheets at home and weve got fulham palace leicester west ham newcastle in a run there that i would say theres two or three clean sheets there potentially because i think our defense is strong enough to keep to keep fulham palace leicester and even west ham i think well get a couple of clean sheets out of that four so if youre looking for 4 five44 oena moreno probably would be my choice because he offers so much going forward and so it is probably time for me to take the nonforest blinkers off and go have a look at them as soon as you start to show a bit of faith its all its all g to go i know thats the thing well get fresh at brighton because its its still robinsons just had a price rise but he goes into newcastle forest man city villa in the next four which isnt great then everton away everton are awful defensively but are managing to score goals and then its brenford who are also managing to score whereas like you say forest around that time brighton fulham palace leicester west ham seems if i was buying a defender now it definitely wouldnt be robinson id be look id be looking an or ive just got a soft spot for moreno hes hes hes got the quality going forward as well i would say he is as good as robinson going forward he is an attacking fullback and hes probably got better delivery than robinson robinsons got that relationship down that side now and hes been in fulham for a couple of seasons and whereas moreno hasnt so hes more settled but i think moreno will flourish at forest and i think its good i think its good to talk about hes got to be someone we look at any more love for sals i think weer like the back four looks solid but the keeper is still a worry we will buy a keeper in january ive absolutely no doubt but until then you can go sales because hes going to play every week i think because i dont think i dont think theu girls ready but we are undoubtedly buy a keeper in january because i think its now the weak spot in the team so well address it and i think well go back in for kellerer i think well try again so okay but and elsewhere on his table villa showing up well arsenal in fifth its perhaps what we expect is there a defense there you expect to be higher maybe united you expect to be pushing a little bit higher newcastle havent picked up from where they were last season despite having an easy run in terms of fixtures their defense still doesnt look worth investment and what can you say about everton at the moment its theres not too many surprises i would expect brenford to be higher ahead of their good run youd expect them to climb that table right vaner bs come in four million option for us theres a slight concern about whether if he if he doesnt play three at the back whether he keeps his place but youve always been pretty hot on him havent you like 25m pounds they paid hes a good player i think hes hes hes pretty much id definitely be taking the punt on him if i could if they back four hes not guaranteed a start because collins and pinnick at the moment of the first choice i would say newcastle im surprised that being a bit i know they paid that southampton game but teams look easy to get at them there doesnt seem to be a lot of solidity there wolves carve them open time and time again they were lucky to escape that game two individual moments of absolute brilliance another share rocket although a little bit of a deflection but the bars winner was worthy of winning any game but w wolves had some good chances in that match and theyre doing well look at the if you look at the rating like we know how tough the start theyve had but theyre 11th on the on the table so credit to them i like wolves i like stran larson i thought he played well in that game theres a lot of play like a nori a lot of players who weve talked about who we might consider but its just not the best time for them nothing massively surprising the only one to talk about here is villa because k is popular but clean sheets just dont seem to be coming but the defensive underlying thats a good weve seen this before with teams like palace in previous years when defensive datas always been at the highest but just hasnt translated i dont know about coner im still not im not convinced hes a good option out of robinson and cono who would you keep thats a good question because robinsons got the attacking threat but cons got the fixtures you would keep coner out of the two if i had to pick one of the two it probably would be coner but i dont think i id pick him so id rather go for moreno or rer or who what we come on to defenders in a bit davis i think leave davis now swit his fixtures looking better i think id take a punt on him because just for a bit of excitement or sagawa youre just trying to make me say sara arent you sara good we talked about him last week but i prefer leaf davis like for me set plays and i think its only hes got one assist but we havent seen the best of him yet it which needs home games if you look at the ticker i think theyve got some fixtures coming up where youd expect them to start showing up as an attacking force their bottom of the attacking data were probably about to see that so they havent been able to flex in that way but i think thats coming i like the look of dap and i think theyve got players theyve bought well and i think of the promoted teams they for me are the one that i think could break out and give us some joy in terms of fbl assets dap was like horrible because i went to the i went to the brighton game missed the first 20 minutes because of a lot of stress but d when dap came off the whole crowd breed the side relief because he didnt offer too much but that run he went on when he just completely outpaced van heck and i thought i thought van heex either going to bring him down for a penalty or hes going to score and just off the top of the bar it was so a great option davis was shackled though he barely came forward at all in that game and it was it switch just put all the men behind the ball and just look to hit on the on the counter which is i think gavves is a hell of a player as well should have got him every ball we put in hes there just heading it away hes he was he was brilliant attack we got city at the top attack got harland putting chance is away liverpool still second despite the blank at forest man utd in third i saw was it jan batra tweeted about rashford trying to get people in invested in him what do you think i was gonna mention him later no you dont youre not i was like i was like no we cant be going near rashford a goal against the mighty barley in the cup good performance before two didnt he i we talked i moaned about what we need we need a bit of a bit of a pep and i think if rashford was to come good thats thats the thing we need right like a i dont know i everyone would flood to him i think hes so streaky though isnt he thats the trouble its like its its time in it with rashford couple of seasons ago i got him on at the right time and i ced him a few times and it turned out well for me but then i think weve seen him just collapse again and itll be good to see him back to some for and being in our thoughts again i would welcome it i think i dont know the other option is gacho but hes not starting is he because dios no keeping him but hes hes brilliant every time he comes off the bench some he scored in the last premier league game ob he scored yesterday as well i dont know how long doo can keep him out for he will be an option at 65 at some point in the season im sure he will i know youre not united fans feel is a bit of a mystery as to why hes not starting yet and until he does we cant go there but there could be options coming from united which would be nice because theyve been a bit of a its been a a derf is we havent been a to go there at all for a while defensively theyve been shaking i still wouldnt trust them defensively but if they if those two come out then itd be that would be very useful indeed viller in fourth brighton in fifth we did show a bit of a different side to us i thought in that if switch game and not in a good way which is how much we struggle to break down that low block defending deep team and weve seen that before thats been classic brighton lots of half chances dominating the game not being able to kill it off i think other than matas shot which he should have scored with we didnt create that much and i think ifwi were fairly comfortable against us because we couldnt do what we normally do which is create loads of space out wide get all wingers like cutting in hitting on the counter because there was nothing to counter because they werent they didnt have the ball so our high press high counter method didnt work so i wanted to maybe see we had like a plan b for that and against everton we maybe did we maybe looked better as the game went on but we didnt against we could have played that game for another two hours and not scored against ipswitch youre getting me very excited for sunday because id like to think were better defensively and better offensively than it witch so thats going to be interesting but will you go for it no i think well probably play a very similar game to we did at liverpool i would have thought i think well start hudson adoy but i dont think well start both of them i think we are going to beat you i think we are so i know well well talk about predictions in a bit my dad is four out of four for brighton so far hes predicted the draws against ipsw and arsenal which is outrageous and the wins against everton and man utd so he thinks were gonna win so its its very different to you the big thing is if we got pedro back r was ineffective was he that game thats good news for pedro owners it is good news im im gonna say it and i probably get slamm for it but im sure pedro comes back into the 11 if you got him no i think youre right thats nice were fifth on the table look at the bottom three though southampton lester it switch just what i was about to come to and everton as well everton southampton lester and i switch theyve got to be the four favorites to be fighting it out for promotion out relegate relegation not promotion theyre and ipswitch are the ones who i think have got the best chance of staying up i think at this point out of the four jamie vards scoring goals but hes barely having any shots and you got to think that conversion isnt goingon to isnt going to carry on but it switch right down x n p 90 of 039 that is leicester a 19th with 083 they that is incredibly low it is but i think the fixtures are king here thats why i think they will start to come out there sh i think when mckenna looked at the pictures he thought were not going to be able to show ourselves until what five or six games in so i think that theyve given a good account themselves already and i think theres enough there to make me think theres po so well see i hope so because i want be great if lee davis is goes one further than doubt he did last year for loon goes to double figures for assists that be great other thing to mention here we talked about the arsenal attack and it hasnt been on point yet which is perhaps where rya has been in the bonus where it shows there is their 12 right 125 xg on penalty per 0 im very surprised at that they again against arsenal i dont know whats wrong with i cant even speak properly against brighton they dominated the play sacka got a lot of joy down the side they had a couple of chances but nothing massively clearcut i wouldnt i wouldnt have thought even hs goal was a brilliantly well taken lob against spurs they struggled in the first 20 30 minutes to even get out i spurs played well massively on the front foot too so im im surprised in the sense that theyve got so much like great attacking like talent in the team and you think with games against wolves and against brighton they would they would maybe have created a little bit more than they have done sack are interest to know what to do with we talked about him at the start already but if odard is out and this is going to be a bit of a pattern then i think hes hes sellable isnt he well the other thing is it impacts havit as well like havit was going to be perhaps a real hope for us as an eight million forward but if hes going to play the midfield role which looks like he is were not going to gamble on tra are we as a field asset maybe we will but thats how its looking jesus is a threat to tr arlo so i look at it and think the oard injury it redu his sacks appeal it moves havocs back which jedu is his appeal trs not an option because jeesus is a threat to him suddenly its like well if you want arsenal you just go ry and a defender dont you and its like thats thats what i meant when i started the show with a bit of dear it feels like things are contracting before our very high is and the od injury is just another twist that does it the thing for watkins is another twist that we didnt expect that like who expected us to think watkins is an next mins problem no chance of that we thought it was a 90 minute player didnt we but i dont see that stopping either so its annoying its just annoying like hopefully sacka comes through it and saaka takes the mantle and goes even without od god im going to be the key man and my outputs not going to be affected but well see well see the jew is out isnt it ive just had a message from focal about the obs video resolution so ive just changed a couple of settings on obs i cant honestly everything looks fine on my screen so were using obs and were not using obs are but we are technically because were streaming it to thingy anyway ive tried ive tried a few things let me know if that stunt made any difference whatsoever maybe it has maybe hasnt but let me let me know should get some play data we can lets have a look at goalkeepers to start with i think we did a quite a big segment on this i dont think anythings massively changed too much apart from the fact that sales might be an option for us going forward but i still think youre going to go ryer or youre gonna go flecken at this point aren you i think thats the way isnt it what i interesting what wild cards do i think because of the oard injury were going to see wild cards with ry and gabrielle now which at the start of the season people have gone v has too much to pay for a keeper but its a bit like harland is it nowhere near as profitable but 29 points for a keeper is still good and im ive been on the end of ive had seasons where ive own that keeper like flecking on 12 points and started looking up and thinking i thought not having a good keeper is not a big deal but theres already 17 points between fle and martin and ryer and henderson theres 21 points different so is that 21 points worth a million it probably is it probably is isnt it so and were not talking about rea whos playing for a team who isnt about theyre the best defensive team as well so i do think were starting to come around to the idea now id be surprised if rey wasnt very popular in wild cards anyway look at henderson down in 23rd eight points ry matched him in an away game against spurs his entire season points its absolutely its amazing how that adds up how the keeper because you your perception is its the position that has the least impact on your team i think it still probably is but when there is one or two keepers racing away with it and weve seen it in previous seasons you look up and think god the gap is quite big its much bigger than i expected fen i think is a very good bet because hell make saves and they got great fixtures so four fs are still going to be an option because of fens fixtures but i do think the odard thing might make people think well i dont need two arsenal attackers so im going to go an arsenal defender and ill go ryer i think that might be what we see i think rays reay is the pick i think ray is the pick out of the arsenal defense i think rs the pick out of the goalkeepers his price hasnt gone up yet which he must be on the verge of going up to 56 hell be a six million goalkeeper by the end of the season ive got no doubt and how many points can he get hes hes on track to score the most of any goalkeeper ever surely because how many clean sheets are they going to get this season 38 games they could get 15 men i say 15 20 15 20 clean sheets the thing is hes showing to be a good keeper isnt he as well because like in pre i think last season it was like well hes a hes a top 10 keeper in a top one defense but when tested rys gonna concede goals but this season hes shown up to be pretty outstanding when they have let chances through and they have hes hes made some good saves so he deserves to be there on merit its not because hes the defender has done all the work for him he has put in shifts and made some good saves so youre getting a very good keeper in front of or behind a very good defense so but i do think four fes could still come out sales weve talked about fleen as well so its not a done deal not yet for br hes very impressive i thought he was he was very impressive against hip switch as well and when he was called into action he just looks very astute very confident i do still worry i did the forest pod today with with matt which was which was good he lets me talk about brighton when i go on there unlike you who shut me down okay very nice he asks me my opinions on brighton lets me go on monologue i must have a word him hes got it all wrong its been lovely i cant remember the point i was trying to make but it was h you worried about wor about the ball over the top thats it i dont think weve got like well exactly well you havent got any pace or we havent well not like if alanga comes on then you got to worry but i dont think hell start so hudson or against velman would be interesting he reminded me of last season we come off the back of that roma thrashing and then we played you and you put out a weird like was terrible team and we ended up winning that game and i just think surely you play hudson or danga against veltman and whos even gonna be at left back its probably gonna be kadogo id say because i dont think hoods gonna play there again kadogo got some minutes in the last game its going to be thatll be a tough matchup for him i think langer is class but you dont think hell start no i think hell play w prow and anderson and well try and win a few free kicks around the box and let war prows do his thing so well see i just want war prows is a player that when ive ever watched him for southampton and west ham ive thought to myself i wish we had a player who every time the free kick is won youre youre genuinely excited because youre expecting it to be on target if not going in and now hes in our team i just cant wait for the first fre kick we win because that anticip score this and the opposition fans are like christ its good i i enjoy having him in the team so i think for that reason hell play well see anyway lets move on to defenders so we cant talk about youre youre going right youre going on sunday ill be doing my walkout videos from brighton on sunday morning and taking some footage from the game as well so make sure you get there in plenty of time unlike yellow and i who just completely messed up our timing what happened we just we left a bit late a bit too late and it was one of those ones where we would have got away with it if there wasnt all the traffic in the world and then we got to we got to m park where you because you have to get a park and ride bus over to the stadium from the from mil road that was completely full so we had to park at the wi dean which was our old stadium and get a taxi over to the stadium we got stuck in traffic we a football match who would have fought it i absolutely outage the game had bloody started it was 10 minutes in and there was there was its however long you think its going to take you to get to the amx add another hour onto it it was funny because we walking around the like right the outside of the wood bean and i said to this is this is our old stadium she was like this was a stadium just about this is defender data on the on the screen look at that milinkovic right at the top 066 is that just because of like one good chance that one for match of day challenge where i went remember so but he second hes a threat to set plays and with james wprs taking him we could see something from him so but i still prefer the fullbacks if youre looking at forest players go ahead trent and then romero and delit as well showed up didnt he for the goals at sav anton he did lets talk about trent quickly what at what point does trent become an issue for us because were talking about him like hes completely indispensable and we wouldnt go anywhere near him thats thats fine but its still no attacki returns for him he is still seven millionish and there are going to be wild cards being played are we entering into a period where there might be a case to go without him i wouldnt personally not yet i can see what youre saying i dont know against forest he didnt c he had four chances but none of those were good were good chances but it was a difficult game for him the best is to come i still think that hes going to be youre not going to be hitting registering an average of 064 and not getting returns so we will start seeing assist soon and hell get two three four goals maybe over the season as well i still think that teams wild card teams will be buil built with him in i dont think theres strong alternatives yet city defenders vardal is there of course lewis is there but lewis doesnt cost you money and hes still an option hes starting tonight which i didnt expect so why you can go lewis to cover the city defense why would you not have the money to go trent to cover to cover liverpool unless of course youre going to go gabrielle and porro and rya so maybe like that combination means you need to bring your budget down for trent so maybe the emergence of the arsenal defense is the way to go rather than going to arsenal attackers you go to arsenal defenders that might mean people have to move money out of their defense but i wouldnt do it id stick with its four game week small sample and the data suggests that returns are coming all sack is hang on he as a season keeper last week absolutely its just one of those on like rogers isnt it like you watch rogers play you think hes close to points and it the weeks go on and on hes not delivering rogers is a five million asset you can bench but trent needs to start getting something but these stats are so encouraging arent they like 064 ex on p 90 hes creating three chances a game the second best is poro with 25 is also a good option but its its even higher than that hes hes not going anywhere hes not going anywhere from my team im keeping him and i dont think wild cards will overlook him yet youre right patience might run out but i think thats folly and i also think defensively liverpool are better this season too so youre gonna get more clean sheets anyway which makes it easier if he was eight million by now we probably see people losing patience but i think at 7even million with the with the options around him i think thats fine i think you hold him and i think he will come good and then some so youd rather have him than diaz j would you i think if youre going to pick one other than seller are the xmin theyre only getting an hour and thats a real shame isnt it i want diaz to be a thing but with gatos showing up so well last night youve got to think that its going to continue that were going to see diaz every time you get to an hour mark between 60 and 70 minutes if you own diaz or josy youre expecting it arent youre expecting the ball to go up and youre almost thinking dont kick it out try and play try play for another 10 minutes without kicking it out because its a horrible feeling ive owned those assets before and eventually you start going n lets go to an e or a gon who are gonna give me 90 minutes lewis lets talk about lewis i think i said to you last week is there a chance lewis could go to left back and we were both we were both like he could do but why would he because gavardo was there that is what happened i dont know if thats good for him or not because hes surely not going to carry on its good in the way that he can hes versatile he can play in different positions so hes got more roots into the team but youd rather he would nail down a spot on the right potentially doesnt case that hes on the right tonight hes on the right tonight and im shocked because i thought walker was back in the weekend to get him ready for tonight and then walker doesnt show up tonight i dont know if theres an injury i havent seen that but i think its clear that lewis is getting the level of minutes that lewis is getting he was off at halim on saturday that must have been with this in mind i dont know its just strange we cant yet figure it out and i think now that european fixures are here well get more answers i was chatting to luke about it and its like its almost like weve got to throw out what we know so far about peps lineups and start again and reassess and tonights lineup is interesting its not what i expected i did expect walker to be in there and lewis maybe to make way do we think lewis starts against arsenal i personally not expecting him to and ive got him benched but if i knew he was going to start i might even start him because he does offer you something going forward as well hes just the darling at the moment and at the moment i just see him st in most games would you buy him now yes i think i think you would if you wild card i think you give it another week i think you want to see what happens against arsenal if youre wild card in six its pretty perfect and most people are going to be wild card in gw six or seven now would have for unless people are going to push it right out i think you wait and see what happens against arsenal if he starts against arsenal i said doneal isnt it youve got to you got to go there i think so because eventually i think its a bit like trent the attacking data here 41 xra on penalty hes got one assist so far hes going to add to that with that in that team hes going to get more assists and perhaps one or two goals as well so you cant avoid him i dont i dont think you can ignore him yep i wanted to talk about robertson he was a bit of a darling this week i know quite a few people did gabrielle to j robber i think ben kellin did didnt he got hurt isnt it ouch it was it was it was quite a popular move do you think theyll people be regretting that now he shows up well on this hes 10th on the list 32 xg weve talked about liverpool looking decent defensively he got the rest in the champions league yesterday sim played in that so you got to think hes pretty nailed on to start i still think hes a hes a pretty good asset but i still think at six million id rather have gabrielle id rather have sber id rather have porro id rather have tren hes still quite far down the list for me i dont know if i gabrielle yes id rather have gabrielle i think there is for me if we know gabrielle and cela both start every game who would you rather have i think theres quite a gap between gabriel and civa i think we talked about it earlier in the preseason about whos going to be the threat at set plays and what we saw at spurs was he was a monster wasnt he like romero just didnt know what to do and there is a difference isnt there when the set pieces come in theres a difference in the level of threat between cra and gabrielle and i think that in the end could tell and could mean that gabrielle gets more points but is there still a naging doubt that cba is more nailed there is right so but gabriel has started its bit of a contrast to last season when he was dropped and had to fight his way back into the team he started so impressively no one scored more from set pieces than gabrielle since he signed no player and no defender scored more set pieces than gabrielle since he signed as well so he could go on and whos whos got the record for most goals for defenders probably i cant even i cant even think of it might maybe john terry got didnt he ianov he scored quite a few ivovic a few he could have a season where he gets seven eight goals thats what im thinking i think that could happen because the set pieces from arsenal look even better d than they did last season and they were scoring for fun they just caused so many issues and when youre up against a keeper like vicario who hes not going to come out and claim it very well it just its just an easy way to target points and to win the game with that is just it was funny though i was watching liverpool and milan last night and liverpool got the first goal canate from a set play and you watch the goal back and you thought my god just look at like theyve got nothing to stop liverpool at set plays like canato and van djk they look like they just want it far more than any of the milan defense and then 20 minutes later vanite scores as well same thing and it was like that arsenal spurs you saw set plays and you just think spurs just arent competing for the ball at set plays theyre just if the delivery is right its over they score and they and it happened and youve got to be strong at set plays to keep arsenal out because often the delivery is good and in gabrielle theyve got someone who just attacks the ball ferociously and its hard to stop it is so yes id rather have gabrielle over robertson because i think its going to be arsenal will keep more clean sheets and theyll keep clean sheets in difficult games and gabrielles always there its hard to predict when the goals come but they will come i think hell get five i think hell get five for sure so do i i think was it meron who said the other day he was like sometimes people just chuck up their center backs and they tr up and it theyre doing it because theyre told to whereas the arsenal center backs go up thinking theyre going to score every time they go up id be id be surprised if gabrielle didnt get five goals this season maybe they get shared a bit more between him and ca maybe the other thing is if odard is out is artetta thinking were gonna have to make more set place now because scoring goals from open play might be more difficult for us so they might even over index on them they might even put more effort in but their set play coach is first class and they and theyre scoring the patterns they run the routines they are you look at him you think god how you stop that the movement and aggression is just different level so and a massive shout out to james of planet fbl because i was listening to his ask james podcast and the questions kept coming in should i bench gabrielle do this every time james was like dont bench gabrielle do not bch gabrielle against us thing coming he was like they he was like both cra and gabriel were both have a good chance against us from a set piece i cant remember sleep having one but gabri needed one to score so we absolutely called that the question is if you had to pick one out of gabrielle and rea where would you go id want them both now i think but no thats not thats not an option id probably go reay just because you can get poro and you can get trent and you can get lewis so you dont have to have gabrielle but i think hes by far the best alternative to three now moving porro up to gabrielle probably people going to look at that i imagine look at this and robo eight ball got gabrielle off the bench for pedro disgraceful that is that is absolutely i was happy with smith row but that is next level any other defenders fair play any other defenders mention ben white hasnt shown up yet hes further down there weve talked about aa moreno isnt on this table yet but a few home games expect him to show up because he will start creating eight nor was going to be an option but wolves have gone back to a back four havent they so that takes the shine off him a little bit i think more than a little bit maybe and ive read that walls 16 games without a clean sheet now so defensively they are there to be got at so maybe we talked about him last week but maybe we need to call our boots on him a bit dena did we talk about him im only joking but he got he got the assist didnt he we slay him last week he slay he turned with an assist played again as well last night in the champions league hes matson isnt getting anywhere near the team at the moment no its just not what we expected at all was it and hes playing well the only other one i pick out is leaf davis here hes 29th on this table 16 watch him climb that lets see if he can make the top 10 in a few weeks because i think i wouldnt be surprised if hes climbing that table soon y i think focal might be on something with these graphics by the way because apparently they are a lot better okay any complaints while what i did if you care is i put up the bit rate on obs well thanks to focal for that midfielders we got gacho at the top we spoke about him a little while a little while ago 234 x non p 90 he hasnt has he started yet he started one d started all not started one game that is madness goalen assist for him we cant consider him barnes is the same isnt he you thought barnes might keep gordon out the side but turns out the other side tell you what hes got to start i when he came on i immediately stuck him in my so rare team and he got me the goal because i knew that hes going to make an impact i think hes been playing well when hes been on the pitch for newcastle did well in preseason as well i just dont see how can leave him out now because he carries so much direct threat and him and gordon i didnt think c played well again i watched the game and i was like as an eak owner first half i was like he might as well go off because i just couldnt see him doing anything know they were gon was good gordon looked lively but that was about it i just dont know whats missing from them this season the verve has gone the verve and the vigor and the i dont know have you watched them and ive just been totally unconvinced every time i think the biggest problem is losing trippier losing the amount of chances he created you think about the start of last season how effective was they were looking to get the ball to him at every opportunity they could so he could create something from the riot and now hes not in the team theyve moved gordon over to the to the other side theres just not a lot of creativity in the side so no youre right thats it so theyre asking for players to step up with individuals so its b like watching england play theres not a whole amount of cohesion be between the team so theyre looking for the big players to step up and create something out of nothing and that is what happened in the ws game but i wasnt impressed with them and theyve had good results its been a good start of the season results wise but in every match ive been pretty disappointed with them and im holding gordon wheres gordon on this list is he on the top hes not even the top 20 to 30 30 68 isnt too bad its pretty good no he has he has played well and its just its just i just something isnt right at newcastle and it makes me wonder as an eak owner how long i can hold him until weve got to we need it to click and hes another example of what we isak is a player that if you havent gone harland or you havent gone harland and salah you can hold isak and hope where he might be able to trade blows with them too but no not sign of it because nas arent playing well enough no i agree with that jotters six on the list weve been talking about him talking about him being being a bit poor the last few games but the stats are impressive diaz is third 139 ex on p for 90 jot is there with 125 and salahs in fourth at 131 sandwiched in the middle between them but even with these stats im just not convinced on jo i think i think he probably has to go for me right do you think he start bouth i think theres a risk there because of gat poos performance last night because you got to think diaz comes back in and gat post stak in a claim i think he loves joto i think and we know that slot doesnt doesnt alternate his team although he has he did say last night well we havent played midweek yet and so j starting last night would suggest that perhaps he does alternate it and lets face it hes not going to look at the forest performance and think that it worked but he was pleased last night with what he saw but then gpo played a big part in that so youve got to think gst do a start isnt he so theres a risk there for sure y i think i probably will get rid smith row 55m you sold him this hes up to 57 now isnt hes hes had a couple of price rises gold and assist for him still coming off around the 70 minute mark but ex 9 83 im happy with him easy hold easy hold i do regret selling him the only reason i sold him was because i had the money to go directly smith ro toza which meant i could keep son and on the off chance he got something at ar or maybe this week against brenford that was probably worth doing but i regret it because had i gone son to sonto id have had money to take whis out now for probably maybe even watkins i dont know id have to do the calculation but i think so it would have given me more options than my transfer this week had i done that and of course me throw out scored some but its its tough got that wrong but its it could have gone the other way as well i did expect arsenal to maybe give up more ground declan rice there but spurs never looked like scoring for me they just didnt create enough and s was ab i thought i thought he had a poor game so smith row with heavy heart and maybe if im wild carding soon hes someone i will maybe get back no classic reversal how you feeling about e now because the underlying stats are good 093 he 18 you want more you hes hes shown they seos had 20 shots and as had 18 so theyre theyre the top two for shot volume from midfield but its just not had the output just the one goal and the pens thing now you we thought that was part of the contract when we signed him and its its not now because matas maybe taking them all but so it is dependent on that i do think returns will come man united and everton next to youve got to keep him for those two because i think he will threaten united because pis will raise himself for that game and everton well theyre conceding three goals in every game so youve got to think hes in line for something there and out of the cup last night as well to southampton its bad for sean isnt it bad dear but we are g to talk about k l in a minute maybe hes the one to turn him around rogers if youre wondering is 63rd on this list is 90 isnt great 037 hes more of an eye test player isnt hes the classic hes the classic grass versus spr sheet i think he is he is grass fcs mascot now because i watch him every week and i think how the hell has he not got anything from this but he is getting a 90 is five million the villa fixures are still great its just like this week for example i probably got a bench one of smith row or rogers and that is such a difficult choice because i think the the fixtures with rogers but smith row keeps finding a way to get in bench maybe i should tell you the bench rogers because the inevitable will happen if you do surely theres a double figure return coming for rogers thats what im thinking thats what im thinking and smith r is gonna keep ticking along but im still trying to hit that double digit for rogers well i havent got that dilemma im gonna im gonna start him but i would start rogers myself but hes currently hes currently starting so well see and the only play i want to talk about was bowen he might be a factor for us in a few weeks maybe hes hes hes a bit pricey but two assists and a goal ex9 not great 041 hes 54th on the list of all midfielders i cant believe antonio is still starting for west ham surely theyve got to change that up and get full krug in or get another option i think he i think he is i think he is but theyve got they got to get him in as soon as hes fit right because antonio shouldnt be playing premier league level anymore should hes still a bit of a handful but i agree with you and i just wonder how is bing not going to play down the middle eventually well thats what im ly doesnt want to go there does he it seems so i dont know i dont know west ham come whats their fixures like i dont think they pick up that well theyre patchy still arent they its a big step to go to bing i think when inos about and okay they are theyre not bad but the next two its wheres the run wheres the concentrated run where youre expecting returns united forest everton but he can get go its now isnt its its if youre going to invest in bowen its probably now because you get chelsea at home brenford ipswitch spurs man united thats not a bad one but would you go for him over embo whos got spurs west ham wolves man united switch probably not if youre if youre only going for harland you maybe got a bit more money to play around but i do like bowen but like you say i think theres theres probably better options and the fixures arent good enough to go there i also think under ly are they a side that are going to let rip and score three or four goals they i remember them going to bright them scoring three and beating you on your own territory and under moyers every now and then they just had that performance that made you think what kudos and b in they could be options but under ly at the moment i dont i havent seen them take the hand break off and that makes me think i dont want to go there at the moment id love him to be an option though this is what we need we need those players to come through him so lets hope it happens y lets go for some forward in for crog is fit okay niger well i cant figure out then answers on post as to why antonio starting hes flagged hes flagged on f s hes got a yellow flag p n says pet was bench i think thats because of brazil right because he was he came back from that i expect petta to be straight back in but if f is fit then surely has to he has to go into the side forwards i dont think we need to talk about harland anymore i dont want to talk about pretty decent is they the only to mention here is and maybe this is a crme of comfort 73 accuracy and 45 conversion rate he cant keep that up thats not possible youre gonna be saying that every week to g we i know and i think i said it last week didnt i said that of all the players this is the one player where you think maybe it can be sustainable because hes he is a machine hence the title of this show this week but i dont want to spend any more time on watkins we talked about wia thats a cool blow got i was never going to play scor and then went off injured he was not going to get in my 11 until gw six but i bought him with that i bought him for the immediate game which he got me a return in then i thought i ben sh for a couple bring it back in six i him for the lovely run probably double up onmo heres a question for you with whist out any impact on inmo i think so because theyve got such a good partnership havent they thats thats evolved over the last over the last couple of seasons tony had the ban at the start of last season they were forced into that partnership tony came back was ineffective brenford struggled tonys out again and then bu v both started well again and hes a good player v loads of energy he can finish causes defenses absolutely tons of problems as well also it lets aumo d drift out right which hes effective at doing and coming in from the from the right i wonder ifs going have to stay a bit more central now i what happens d and sharda comes in well thats what thats where the smart money is going isnt it and i think that maybe carvalo could play a could be a factor in this i wonder whether car after last nights performance somehow found a place in that team because hes a quality player isnt he so i dont know whether some system can be built around carvalo as an option by thomas frank i just dont know but at the moment itll be shardow will start down the middle with and bumo playing off him and maybe cal comes in into a midfield role but well get one this is if youre wild card in wild card six i dont know if youll have enough information to make a decision on brenford in terms of is vandenbberg an option is sharder an option is cavalia an option maybe we need a bit more data before we can commit but you can move to them when it sorts itself out theres no doubt though the brenford run is so strong that you want get on it though right is sher an option at 54 in midfield i think so i think that if youre brave and you commit the wild card this week or next then its worth going for i think because so the fixes is just so good hes not a prolific goal scorer hes not a central striker in my opinion two goals is the most the most hes ever had in the league it could be worth going for because i think that itd be nice i think you can take a risk on a couple of gambles and how big a gamble would it be because i think he will start and i think hell start down the middle for a team with good fixture so i like it i like the idea of it youre getting a 54 out position midfielder with lets say lets say you wild c in six with west ham and wolves at home theyre man utd and ipswitch if youre going to take a punt on someone and then move off a highly owned player like smith row even rogers someone like that then he might be someone to consider kevin sharder look at i was talking about him xery i was impressed with hes fourth on the on the list he how he didnt come away with a return against southampton i dont know he looked lively and interesting but again im not sure were going to be risky how much is he in fbl is he about six million six and a half he was he started his season at seven million i he didnt turn up with the reputation as a prolific goal scorer hes more he plays he play a role in the buildup hes hes somewhat creative as well and i think that hland is the goal scorer and zeri is just a different option and i think we can see that right i dont i dont think hes going to attt investment when theres midfield options from united thats the problem i it was one of those games all right i saw the highlights of it and its just every highlight seemed to feature zury in some way it was we dont fully trust him yet but hes someone who might emerge for us a bit later in the season hes someone ive now put on my radar when i hadnt thought about it but maybe it was just the like southampton effect and we need to be a bit be a bit less warm on it anyone else you want to talk about here was well every time we got to talk about weve got to talk about calv lein dr david 1963 hes very popular 59m im seeing loads of transfers in for him just to come back to the fixtures again the fixtures for everton are unbelievable b leicester crystal palace newcastle both at home ip switch fulham southampton west ham brenford man united wolves thats right up to gw 15 dont play any top six teams until game we 15 its crazy isnt it and they will have to score goals and to be honest like in attacking terms they have had spells long spells in games where theyve looked convincing him and mcneil there is no reason why you shouldnt consider them with that run of fixtures mcneil i dont think we touched on in midfielders hes 54 i believe and so could be an alternative in that no players created more chances in the league 17 chances so those two we should talk about them my only fear is the levels of confidence in the everton camp and how long is it before it starts to tell on the output of the attackers as well c l on pens as well though so it sound were scratching round at the moment are we with the visa injury that does seem to be the most obvious replacement chris wood could be as well though because i do think forest to grow in as a force and weve got decent fixtures and he could score you were you were last week why not in that bracket and the other player to mention is inia because i do think hes 59 maybe if you dont have eza its an option i dont know if i double up on ezza and cer but united and everton i think its only he got his first goal for the club last night its only a matter of time before he scores in the league so hes another option so there are there are choices there to move visa out to evan nilson as well maybe in that bracket too yep none of them none of them are gotos none of them are obvious and maybe calv l is the most obvious because of what we know in the past and the fixtures so im im behind it but i think if i was wild carding id probably look to probably go with watkins and harland and a four five probably if is what i do i dont know if id go fre strikers i think i still think j pedro is the one if hes if hes fit 5 five i still think thats incredible value theres a moon is problem for a lot of people who started with him after his what 40 shots and no goal of all the players weve talked about today you can have patience with players and seb still got in kungu so you never know what might happen but moes is the obvious sale for me if youve got him because him has came in and scored and you have got options now to move you could move down to caval you could move to vardy for example you could move to pedro if you havent got him evan nson like you mentioned there were options around that bracket so if youve got moones i think thats quite a quite an easy sell if i had mes id be taking a pun on cavalon although hes is ill at the moment thats it the thing is with c as well its the fitness isnt it is he just finds a way of breaking down and so you can look at that fix run and think well hes going to be great for that fix run but you cannot take anything for gron with his fitness because weve seen it year after year havent we daps going to be an option for us at some point this season i like him i like him and when i switch gets some slightly better fixtures i think hes gonna start scoring some goals i reckon hell get im gonna im gonna go optimistic im say he gets 12 goals this season what for c lein no deap dap maybe but between 10 and 12 goals maybe get double f its very difficult for a promoted striker to get double figures but you rate him do you i like him i like him i thought was built was buil as the as the goal scorer maybe but dap may be more as a battering r but maybe hes looking very direct hes got a lot of threat pace and strength so its whereever its which can make the most of the better fixtures but i think between eight and 10 might be ambitious minutes are a bit of a concern as well because he was again he was subbed early against brighton just a lot just a lot to like about him right anything else on forwards we move on no i will say that the data has been wrong tonight so it has been spotted in chat and i spotted it as we go so the xgi column is not correct so i dont know whats gone wrong with that so apologies and i will post the proper calculations post podcast so sumits gone wrong in the calculations they look right no theyre not theres no way harlands got 228 xgi non penalty per 90 right so somethings gone wrong there so the order is right in terms of probably the xgi tally but not the totals in that column its not been right for any of the table so apologies for that oversight very difficult very difficult to get it right after work sometimes when you when youve got up against it so i will check them and put new tables out on twitter post release to get when i say they look right like they look logical like none of them look they look logical but the numbers arent right the calculations so somethings gone wrong in the xl calculation so ive been spotting it all night thinking that cant be right and its been spotted in chat as well so apologies for that but i dont think anythings misleading i think like the order of the players is probably ab thats what and the other data is its just the xg non penalty per 90 column i dont know whats gone wrong i need to look at it so apologies for that nigel hes fuming on mute no marks gone to beat up nigel poor nigel he doesnt he doesnt deserve that thats it for forwards while mark is gone i just want to talk about sleeper who the sponsor of black box this season interesting one this time out if anyone listening to this is looking at becoming a form of content creator for their club or has any interest in making social media posts making videos doing all that thing s got a paid opportunity to do that its called the 12 voice theres a link in the description into this video and essentially you can fill out an entry form you can send over to sleeper and theyre looking for people or fans who are of clubs to do social media posts to to do videos to do all different content around their own their own club i debated entering it for brighton and then thought im already doing enough cont know youre the same mark theres no way im doing because i do forest focus as well and planet fbl correspondent but its good and well see well see who comes forward hopefully some of the fpl community volunteer for that because itd be good to see some of the some of the names representing their clubs we know there knowledgeable people out there for their club so lets see who comes forward so and is like as i said i did the forest pod talking about brighton and talking m about the match up and if you if a bit about your about your club theres nothing better than just getting a platform to talk about them and talk about your views and things so give it have a look at the link fill out the application if youre interested and you might be the next content creator for your for your club lets take a look at some fixtures then this is our predictions for the week coming up they all pretty similar again mark were getting a bit i know i not too bit too similar with these i think you moved the you moved the garden center game from forest brighton up to west h i think youre probably right i know well i believe you made the garden center game forest i was take that went straight off when i saw that no chance i do think the the west ham chelsea game is probably the better option ill give you that well well start with them we start with west ham chelsea they are the garden center game im keep that logo on for the whole time were talking about it i might just move over a bit because its a bit not center it annoys me hang on but what would you make of this i this is one of the few ones weve gone different ive gone for a west ham win in this one i bournemouth i dont know how bournemouth lost that game to chelsea it was a real dingdong of a match 14 bookings 14 yellows i was like and it wasnt a filthy game it was like little niggly fouls but he just it just ran away with him full te bookings and it did take the edge off it was a horrible game to watch palmer i was watching throughout thinking come on come on convince me convince me i need pay attention of you and no just wasnt there and chelsea a work in progress managed to get through it a bit of quality bournemouth again were unlucky not to get more from the game and i thought they deserved at least a point from it so chelsea smash and grab a bit and kungu ironically off the bench and i dont know i dont know what to make of chelsea how long is it going to take before we start in them i think its going to be weeks yet isnt it the player i was most impress with sancho when he came on i thought that is that is what man utd have been crying out for ever since you signed and i havent seen any performances from him in the man utd shirt like the 45 minutes he put in for chelsea for his quick feet direct creating loads of chances defenders couldnt get near him half the time so been to see if he can if he can nail down a spot in the team but did you hear him after the match it was moresa talking about hes like ive said to enu and mada and sancho and just listing all these players and none of them are guaranteed like jesus christ 12 players youve listed mentioned ju hall who hasnt got a sniff either and its like its its got to be a bit of a mess isnt it mesas probably g got to put a front on but its its horrible and i just hope palmer can come through it and be what we need him to be because hes a and i love him hes a great player and i dont think hell hit the heights in next se last season but hopefully he can still emerge from the chaos that is there and be an option anyway thats our guarden center game ive gone for a west ham when youve gone for a one0 leicester everson big game theres two big relegation teams two relegation matchups this week ive gone for a leicester win 21 youve gone for a two if leicester do win this d could be packing his bags you think so already well could be i think theres a very real chance they could win it youve gone two1 ive gone two all i think that i can only think as a game of goals i dont trust i defense i think evan got enough in attack to cause leicester problems and you dont need much to cause everton problems it seems defensively why are they playing michael keane all the time when theyve got obrien i just dont know thats not helping ds calls because the everon fans can see it and kean was at fault for the watkins goal and i dont know and d knows keane from his bernie days so is there is there too much faith in him there i think you might be right theyre are theyre starting to ask questions arent they but u it depends on the nature of the defeat if they lose two or three nil then yes but squeaky win for leicester you still hope that d has got enough in the bank to keep his job true liverpool bournemouth liverpool looking to bounce back another trip to another trip another trip another game at anfield for them to bounce back against the bourn side who were going to play very differently to forest much less focused on defense i think its going to be again quite an open game for them which i think will suit liverpool ive gone for a couple of goals to bournemouth ive gone for three2 here youve gone for 31 whats behind that you just you just think theyre going to allow goals all of a sudden i think the i think the liverpool defense is strong i think bournemouth have got a lot going forward and in terms of pace and power they could maybe catch liverpool so i think they might get one and ive gone 31 i think they will bounce back i its hard to believe with the quality theyve got that they wont that theyll fall foul again and get a negative result which will be a negative result be a draw but i do worry like i came out came out the forest win delighted but also concerned that are they going to be our teams going to be able to repeat what forest did and thered be a lot of teams looking at that and thinking well theres a blueprint there that we can copy and there are possibly teams better equipped than forest to do it as well so i dont think bfar no i dont think bfar gonna do that no theyll press theyll press and theyll try and use their pressing to win the ball up the field i think that of all the i think ive seen data recently that shows that bournemouth the bre you had the most success pressing in advanced areas this season so theyll rely on that to try and get them chances and it might it might work but i think liverpool are good enough to play out of that and catch them so ive gone 31 yep youve also gone 31 in the southampton ips switch game we both gone for an ip switch win youve gone for three goals for ip switch ive gone for two and just the one for southampton again tricky one to call i just think ive been more impressed with it switch so far despite the fact theyve had quite tricky games theyre going to be better at keeping it at tight at the bat because se hampton are just too a side at times trying to play out from the back and if have got that threat up front but three 31 would be a real marker for rip switch i think in this in this one i just think theyve got it in them and i worry about southampton i just is what we thought the moment russell martin doesnt appear to be changing things up and he tried to go back four against united still got turned over by three goals and i just dont think theyre good enough theyve lost stevens now to a suspension so howard bellis will come back in i look at their defense and just ramsdale has made a difference and will make a difference and will keep that try and keep their goal conceded tally down but i just think hes got to thank this task i dont think defensively theyre strong enough and theyre exposed i do like flyn downs i think theyve got some good players around him but they havent got enough and ive seen what it takes firsthand to stay up and i look at southampton and just think i just dont see it i dont think theyre strong enough i know its a bit less important for us now what because in previous seasons when we known that were going to wild card in six say you dead end your team dont you make sure you use a transfer so you dont lose it whereas you dont lose it this time so you can bank and then and then wild card but if i was den ending the team this week i think leaf davis would be someone that id id look at because ive got robinson at home to newcastle i think newcastle score in that game looking at 45 asset i think you could go for one of suara or davis dont mind it going forward davis prob be the preference definitely i do think id make it switch the favorites for this game and both of us have gone for a way win and so if i was going anywhere that be be that be where i go i go leaf davis but there are there are home games to come thats where it switch and lea davis are going to be most effective just faned him because i just think theyve got more about them than sampton and i just worried defensively about sampton yep villa wolves the midlands derby ive gone for a 31 villa youve gone for a 2 nil so both expecting it to be relatively routine you never know whats gonna happen in these sorts of games though its just what impact is the european fixtures gonna have on villa they put a strong side out last night they won the game hows is that going to impact them but i think the quality theyve got and weve talked about the wolves defense they will win the game its whether or not wolves can catch them at the other end but we saw villas defensive data as being pretty strong so ive gone two nil i think it will be routine so watkins surely comes away with something from that then youd hope it depends if he can get it in the first hour l doesnt it get thats a trouble right so good point i think hes a decent captain option this week because youve got youve got obious got the liverpool bournemouth game with salah looking so good but there isnt a lot of other decent options i dont think from because harlands playing arsenal not going to go for either of those i wouldnt have thought although if he didnt have salah i probably would be tempted just to stick it on stick it on harland but who else is there maybe son at brenford if youve got him like you do might be an option maybe he comes out well in the in the alos is the 60 minute thing a problem maybe were putting too much into that 80 he got 80 against last night 60 okay fair enough so maybe but he got 80 because they were chasing the game though the thing the game state was suggest so i dont know does it put eye off the c i know that james on planet fbl captain him did well and he matched highland so maybe you just ignore that and hope that his ex mins goes up but duran you cant hes not gna leave jan on the bench is he thats the thing so its a problem but not cameras made the cameras a bit bigger for why not fullam newcastle youve gone for a newcastle win 21 ive gone for a one all i was quite surprised you went for a newcastle win as youve been quite down on their performances i just think barnes will start i think theyve got enough in attack and again i think the quality will win out but i im not hopeful of like an eak hall or anything here i just want to see them playing with a lot more rhythm and fluidity and that bit of verve and you are right perhaps it is just a c ity gz jo linton is there creativity youd think garez is creative enough but the trippier did bring so much youre absolutely right he was he was such an outlet for them in terms of their buildup play and his delivery was first class and the liento doesnt bring that so is that what theyre missing you might be on to something i think what you want to see if with liento and hall or whoever is okay they lose a bit of creativity but are they like a better defensive unit are they more solid i dont think they are either i think teams still feel like theyre able to get at them particularly when theyre playing away from home so ive gone for a drawing that spurs brenford ive gone for a 31 but spurs are struggling to score goals theyre struggling to convert the chances thats do pretty dominant displays against leicester where they couldnt score dominant display against arsenal in the first 30 minutes couldnt put the ball away slanky got 90 minutes but son looks a bit off it madison hasnt been performing ive gone for three but maybe a bit mb hope ful than logic i think they squeak it i wouldnt be surprised see bren forgets on it though and anie is just like going further and further into despair isnt he with every game he was very post match give it a rest please youve got to be i dont know i think you say a lot dont you people you tell a lot about someones character in adversity and the minute spurs started struggling his postmatch and his the way he treated his media just went downhill from what it was i loved his arrival at spurs and what he brought and some of the character he showed and some of the things he was saying then he lost all that the minute spurs started struggling and its carried on this season hes been so sour postmatch and dont know why you have to be like that i get it that hes its a very difficult job to do when you just lost a game to go in front of the press and the media but other managers manage it right i saw our manager steve cooper have to do it every week because we were losing many games and he never treated a media like that and i know perhaps hes not under the same pressure but there were degrees right and i dont like it and it makes me think well if hes like that for the cameras and the media which were all seeing what is he doing behind the scenes that we dont all see and its not good its not good and im starting to worry that hes job is isnt n secure because i would never have said this six months ago i thought he was doing a fantastic job and he was the player a manager to take spurs forward but theyre struggling arent they and some of the stats coming out now about his win rate and the recent run starting to be worrying so they i think theyll do enough here but an needs to get more from that team theres no doubt i saw i saw quite a good post about him which said when he first joined a lot of the media treated him almost like a bit of a ted lasso character like hes that plucky underdog hes come from australia hes inherited this team hes going to turn them around and all this and he hasnt he isnt playing up to that or doesnt want to play up to that or whatever because like you say the way he talks to journalist sometimes he did he does get asked some stupid questions and but the way he responds to them i dont think is a good way of is a good way of responding to them and like you say you talk about cooper i thought cooper was very classy the way he responded to the media and posu hasnt got the reputation to be able to get away with the way he talks at times no because pep does it doesnt he pep can be a little bit spiky with the press and when hes asked a silly question he makes it known its a cly question well i just dont i dont it makes you feel uncomfortable and if you support spurs do you want your manager to be like that do you do you laugh it off or do you start going being a bit of an isnt he it would start to worry you i think because you think well if hes like that there its getting to him he hasnt got the resolve to take defeat and take adversity and not let it show in how he comes across and as a leader and as a football manager thats a thats a weakness i would say so its a its worrying i think the way he talks in terms of its my second season i always win things in my second season look at the stats the way hes defensive about himself you dont tend to see too much you dont klopp had his moments where he was a bit of an but it wasnt in the same defensive way you marinho because he was very arrogant with things and when he got questioned but i havent seen that with many other managers so have to see how he how he turns around its not a great trait to have is it no its not i me weve seen it with a bit of slot as well a bit of arrogance he said about hes talking about losing to forest being a disgrace its like we are that was that was that wasnt great that wasnt a great look anyway palace man united ive gone for my im sure i get slated for this ive gone for a palace win here two1 man united one all youve gone for a draw i was just impressed with the e and kea mata com i liked it i think it looks like theyve been playing together for for years not and ketcher coming in for his first game and i think thats just given them the lift that they needed theyve dealt with the gaye stuff now thats all done results havent been great but now theyve got eneter in and hes giving him that extra bit which they lost when they lost to lisay i think they have a little bit too much for manu in attack theyre still b new defenders few injuries could be right you could be right i think that itd be good if that clicks im love eddie i think hes great i wish forest signed him so i do wish him well there and i think he could click in this game and the first goal is around the corner like i said so i can see i can see palace tur them over i think it is the fixtures where you the home style end get behind palace theres a big atmosphere there and theyve got goals in them for sure what united can do at the other end ive gone a draw but maybe sit on the fence i do like the 21 next to the big one its the big one next the black box derby black box derby chris phillips says an arrow brighton win as phillip says an arrow brighton win mark suin what a surprise says a forest win i dont know i you couldnt score against it witch so why do you think youre going to score against forest thats what that would be the simple question but i do think we can catch you as well i think weve got some threats and i do youve got threats but the trouble is you talk about matoma but weve just seen how well moro dealt with salah so i dont necess think mata is going to be as dangerous to us as he can be against other teams so i think defensively our fullbacks are good in good form and our center backs are great as well we got caught one n at your place with a ridiculous setpiece goal last time out i dont think well get caught like that again and i do think going forward were were got we got some confidence and some weapons there so i think itd be a good game i hope it is i think its i think its going to be a decent game to watch i dont know why i made it the garden center game im in a im going to madrid this week and i know no we tried to get tickets but it wasnt it wasnt possible i think we were offered to go to athletico to see atletico play but id rather id rather see real madrid and i dont want to miss as pathetic as it sounds i dont want to miss brighton v forest i dont want to miss man city b arsenal youre gonna watch the games when youre out there but you gonna be there with your like noted hany and your union jack boxers in a in a pub watching the football no ill be in my brighton ill ill be full bright kit full brighton kit god as abroad do i want to know i know its not great anyway thats the black box st thats always a good one shane we still havent been to see one in person no we cant do it we got to make sure we get to one and then we can do a vlog when were there so i think its february the 1 foresty brighton right make sure you make it yes definitely well get you a seat dont worry well do hospitality as i said well get hospitality in the new weve got those new have you seen it the new container things weve used shipping containers we turn shipping containers into a new hospitality suite its pretty old its as good as it sounds right but its like 300 quid and im thinking id do that for the black box i was about to say as a joke probably with the all owner to be about 300 quid and it say exactly how much he was 300 quid a ticket and im like lets give it a go im curious as to what its like what in a match inside a shipping container it attach like a massive crane that like spins around thatd be fun it ill send you pictures its not pretty theres pictures of what its going to look like but it doesnt look like that at the moment and its in the corner i dont want to sit there for the black box stby we should do it for a laugh it be quite funny okay im in sounds good final game of the week is man city v arsenal weve both gone for an on the fence draw i come for a nil this just both teams dont want to lose nil youve got thats it isnt it because its early in the season and my feeling is that arteta will go there and think okay were were rice is back but od guys still out would he take a draw there youve got to think he would right youve got to think you got to think this is a must not lose for both teams to because its about its about the psychology of what that would mean for the winner and so if theyre both going to go home thinking what its i must not lose the likely outcome is a nil isnt it ive gone one all id like to think there is a goal in it but you could be you could be right if i was picking the fixture thats most likely to be nil it would be that one i think i agree you could maybe argue like sthampton ipswitch as well is a similar must not lose but i think both teams will mistakes i think i think i switch will fancy the chances against so might attack a bit more and and mistakes like you mentioned was it which game was it last season when arsenal absolutely dominated city and then still managed to lose it was that at the etti had or was that the city arsenal i dont dont i dont know what i dont know where it was i cant i cant recall i think i think it was at the ettihad i think it was aral went there and should have won it and ended up losing it and that was ultimately what cost him the leag so id love if arsenal got a result i would and i think it would be good for the premier league as well because i think that the pace at city is setting is already a little bit worry and its a bit its bit like i said about fbl its like we want it we dont want it to be we dont want city to run away with it so the last result we want is a city home win arsenal out push back and then with the odard injury that could impact them and psych psychologically as well losing this game so the best result for the neutral probably would be an arsenal win yep if you want to get involved in the blackbox predictions you can you can join our patreon theres still time to get in patreoncom blackbox weve got a website where we track all the predictions of all the members and ourselves we predicted 40 matches now mark is currently in the lead but only by two points you get one point for a correct outcome three points for a correct score very close ive got slightly better out comes but youve had i think one or two more correct scores so theres not much it look at hottin though ian we talked about him last week crazy 73 correct outcomes blood l is absolutely ridiculous what is he hopefully i dont want dont wish anyone to gamble but hopefully he makes some money out of his of his predictive powers because thats crazy get involved if youre interested in that there still time also join the sleeper pick him league as well thats correct outcomes too and monthly prizes or prizes worth up to 500 a month completely free to play link in the youtube description below al an overall prize for that but get involved in that if you havent already captaincy as i said interesting week this week harland is top of all the metrics no surprise but has the hardest game the daya is wrong in this as well the xgi is still wrong in this by the way we wont mention that we dont need i figured out what i did i figured out what i did by the way in my workings i added xg to xgi rather than xa to xg so the columns were wrong and that was caused by the cost tab malaky that i spoke to you about so i will correct it i will correct it updated tables so off it wont happen again and i know exactly why its happened and apologies every week i hear about that cost that cost tab in scout its caus you no end of problems isnt it its fine its its fine ive sorted it now its on the chart anymore dont worry dont wor its fine its salah isnt it is there a conversation here around that most managers now have got salah even with harland there in their team most have moved that way as well if you dont salah you probably would go harlem wouldnt you lets face it i think its watkins harem salah thats the three do you sal what have we got what have we got in the matrix for this week bring that up lets have a look i think i probably had those three as well son okay so salah watkins son i dont know i dont know if we saw enough on son though no you think his spurs win son should get a return at of that because hes on pens and he is central to their attack hes not central because hes playing out left but i think its its because of what harlands done so far if you dont have sal its its very difficult not to say that harlands not the second choice right next week as well we havent got harand highlighted here he probably is entering into that bracket but salahs got sacks got leicester watkins has got ipswitch again thats a three great you would think that those three are stronger captain c options in harland in a normal env situation but its just what weve seen so far is just ridiculously crazy and then look at that run though look and gw seven onwards its hard to question captain in maybe brighten away but you are definitely going to captain harland fulham wolves santon bournemouth i would bri away there you go so this is why the i havent got harland yet ive got to think about wild cards in i game week six or certainly game week seven i think because of that run and the damage he can do in that run is pretty considerable i thought and when where did you go to the captaincy you get to game with kate and its a problem this is your team for the next game week you mentioned the wild card as well you got that on the on the radar but let me know your whats your thoughts what you thinking well i think i dont think i do anything this week i dont necessarily need to un unless i hear isach or xia pedro are out because i think that im not booking in the wild card game week six if i was i dead end something into game week six it might be that id take two transfers into six and then get watkins and mumo in for son and wiissa right which i could and then go without harland at newcastle and hope that sacka covers the captaincy which he could do so i think what ill do is not ill probably hold this so its reyya coner trent pedro poo sacka e salah son rogers isak and jal pedro if that 11 are fit ill probably just go in with that save the transfer and then decide whether i wild card next week and take the extra transfers through or whether i make transfer next week and wild card ahead of seven y but i could ive looked at wild card this week i dont think its worth it i dont think i want to move to harlem when hes got arsenal so its more likely i do it in six when hes got newcastle or seven when hes got fulham at home i think hes hes probably the likely outcome so i dont see a transfer here i could do wher to calv lein ive got not one in the bank but then who do i who do i pull out maybe xia pedro if hes not going to be fit theres talk that he wasnt training today again so i dont know what you what do you make of that what would you do there i think if theres doubts around lak and pedro going into the weekends i think i would probably look to move wher out and have that as a good because you dont your team no offense isnt looking that strong this week and if g pedros gonna miss out and robinsons gonna come in id think id much rather have an option of a calv lein or a vardy in case that was that was going to happen but its the thing is the only major difference between my team and other peoples is harand playing arsenal because most harland teams have got well they most harland teams have got salah but they havent got sacka so its only looking i dont dont know i dispute the fact it looks weak because in a all week it would because harlands got gna score goals but its not true and there not so i dont think it looks weak because its as good as any other team the only thing thats missing is harland playing arsenal which i dont know you could say well thats a major problem but id like to think it isnt because of all the games against arsenal i would say that could be the one where i can think well hes only gon to get one goal maximan so i dont think its weak i think its okay but the problem ive got is my differentials are sacka and son and i dont see necessarily see son getting me anything and sacka probably wont do anything either because hes playing city so i dont have anything there thats going to help me make up ground because people have got har got sol so i might get a green arrow but its not going to be its not going to be a game which helps me make up ground so i accept that but i dont think im going to lose ground unless haren goes crazy sur which he could this is it he could so i think that it all depends on whether those flags come off i think saaka will be fine because hes playing tonight right so i think isaks fine because just blur vision so i dont think thats a problem unless it was concussion and its xia pedro and if if shia pedros out im tempted to do it anyway because i dont necessar think brighton are going to score many goals against thats what i was about to say are you not tell just to get rid of the whistle problem and bring in another cheaper striker its caval zill though isnt he so youve got that so hes flag as well is or its v or its who was the other or would bringing bring you bringing in chris be the ultimate turnaround i just i just think id rather have the two transfers next week and then decide that gives me the option to wild card or not whereas i they use a transfer this week ive got a wild card next week i think thats true because id be going s in bumo and having three million in the bank and i dont want to do that whereas i if i have two transfers i can go s and bumo wier to watkins and that is then a team where i can go well maybe i can go about harlem one more week and hope that sacka watkins they will be differentials or salah could be a differential because you think that many teams are going to go salah to sacka dont you so i could have a decent team with two transfers next week that makes me think i havent necessarily got go harland but he could destroy newcastle can he this is the thing hes like it hes dominant and its a shame because it does limit our possibilities a bit now well im im in im in a similar dilemma of when im going to when im going to walk card as well cuz i think my team is all right for game week six i probably wont have s well i wont have sacka unless i sell but i can get to an arsenal defender so ive got henderson in goal with trent porro and robinson salah captain jotter gordon rogers harland mateta who was a problem i thought might be a problem for me hes now i think quite a good asset out nowhere and g pedro and then ive got smith row on the bench who can come in if pedro is out my first thoughts were to were to roll earlier in the week and then i could do salah to sacka and tedson to raya for two threee trans for two free transfers that means losing salah against wolves but gets me two arsenal players at home to its southampton first isnt it and then and then lester which i like the look of but i am thinking that jotter is a problem so i could do jotter to mumo and then id still have the money to do porro to next week next week so i would i would role this youre playing robinson at home to newcastle which is probably the only weakness here cu if xia pedros not fit he got smith row so theres not theres not any other weakness there i would say other than maybe jotter but we just dont know how thats going to go do we its he loves him but there is a threat there now for sure do i do i give j one more week or do i bring in inoma who im going to want anyway from game week six well you give j this week i think you think ill give him this week i would because hes g to get a le half an hour true and boomo at spurs could he could he could do well at spurs thats the thing its but i would i would probably hold jota for this week see what happens i do like the idea of getting ry in for henderson because then that gets rid of that goalkeeping problem gets me gets me the arsenal defender who i want the most selling salah isnt ideal but im getting in saaka whos lets be honest a pretty good replacement with the two home games hes got so but then im still on to j so if js then a problem from next week then it might be wild card time because thatll be three transfers and i can get rid of robinson i can clear up my bench a little bit you got johnson there when are you gonna play it if you dont play it next week i know so it could it could and i like the fact that i could i can keep the two three transfers and still play it now and still keep those two three transfers was in previous years id be decid id need to make a transfer this week and then wocks i couldnt hold and then and then wild card so its leicester before southampton first so its a slightly not its the slightly worst game of it two but still pretty good im probably gonna roll anyway both us rolling brilliant both us rolling fun all that all that all that analysis and were both were both rolling thats pretty much it from us weve got a couple of super chats to answer it weve got this is just a message from super duper fc whos been a member for 30 months of the youtube channel thank you he says yellen and marks vlogs are the weekly entertainment yellers are good i like some of her transition she uses very clever shes got lots of ideas and its good its good i enjoy doing i think like we both got the same camera arent we so we both use the same god she loves it she hasnt got the drone though ive invested in a little drone to help me do the gta type shots behind me which is cool but so ill be doing it ive got to find a spot in brighton on sunday morning so im looking forward to doing it in brighton see where i can do didnt have she didnt have any time when she went because we were so late so theres no footage god no its the only thing about it is it means i spend monday night editing the video which means tuesday night im rushing doing the data and then i get the xg data wrong so thats my fault so i need to sort i keep say teach me how to do the tables and i can help out but i know i know well sort out so i thats rattled me tonight getting that wrong because its the first time its happened i dont think weve ever had the data wrong like that so apologies i will get correct we have thanks because you were rattled then its very rare dont get me wrong but it has it has fair its its exel its so easy to break it is y new member atab boy thank you new member nigel the crab dont understand that left and joined again left and joined thats a understandable heroic doses thank you for the super chat i get the rule but triple sub here we go triple sub 5920 jotter gets one because hes off first diaz gets three because hes off at 605 imagine they were defenders fbo equals a clown show it is a ridiculous rule ridiculous i think it should be when the ball goes up thats the minute 100 100 because then it then its about like who walks the quickest or who furthest i was saying to pra well thats great marginal game because diaz is on the wing so therefore jos has willing the sh distance but it shouldnt come down to that should its absolutely crazy did someone say its just poor like x steps or x grass thats youre right the swing for a defender would have been massive wouldnt it and like imagine trent and robertson and robertson is over there and trents nearest so trent goes off sooner robertson makes it a bit of a distance and he gets a clean sheet that it could happened because hes taken them both off he took them both off at his didnt he i think at the end he did so it they wouldnt go off on 60 minutes maybe but it is still a very silly rule so do it when the ball comes up not when the player steps over the line its got ive won ive won two leagues in the past by one point one against you and one when i was in the cash league years ago i know thats the point thats the two points and i was robbed of that because of the edit an assist did you have to bring that up again i thought that was awful on saturday no harand got that second goal and i thought who got the assist bloody edison of all they rubbing it in they gave it straight away as well ming around no doubt course maliky fox thank you hi as a mark jackson to calv lein for a hit not for a hit no id keep i wouldnt want jackson particularly but if youve got him id keep him not for a hit i just dont think like i said the dcla gets the fitness its longterm i worry about him getting match after match after match and so i think hes good for a couple of weeks but as hes ear already so whats behind that i want to you need to get a bit of that before for sure but its the hit its the four points youre putting pressure on to score one straight away which hes not that prolific that you can do that yep no i agree not for me and the final one is from p lassen again thank you for the super chat should i do vardy to wood or hold wood longterm it means wood to vardy or hold w no id keep wood so i i think that aan is still some time away from being the starter and i think wood can cause you a few problems and well create for him hes not brilliant in the buildup but hes there to finish things and well create for him and we got some good fixtures to come so hold him for sure y at boy says like the stream lads and gals is a small effort but for as mark very helpful y if you havent liked already do give us a like do drop us a comment and if you are listening on podcast give us a festar review if youve enjoyed it because again those this is the place im reliable xg data so where else would you rather be than watching two men talk about wrong xg days some grand people moaning that fbl is broken because he had a bad game week thats what you want right thats it well i dont like your team this week so i dont think youre going to be that happy next week thanks a lot i dont know i dont understand who what team looks much better than that mil it sorry i dont think its no watkins maybe could go off i know to be fair is i dont think its going to be a very high score scoring week so youll probably get away with that no probably not it depends how that arsenal city game goes doesnt it because we are reliant on those assets reliant on those assets without ry and sakur have done awfully without harand lot of managers would have done awfully so it shows you how alarm weve become on arsenal and city already this season so well see i think salah will come good i think i think therell be points in that game for everyone whos on salah but im not holding my breath for summer returns but well see stranger things have happened they have well and i would say good luck in the black boox derby but i dont mean it get i will be messaging you so make sure you get your phone sorted out in madrid because i want to be able to send you photos on the ground of us celebrating and i wish we go together good game a good game nice that its getting closer between the two teams because when we came up the thought of sharing the match with you watching forest getting beaten but now i think by the time we get to it like you come to the city ground i think thats going to be i think its tight now between our teams so yes do i am proud that forest have made progress and closed the gap a bit and you never know you made the europa league maybe we can maybe were not too far away either well see i think matt said to me where do we think we finished and i said probably like ninth and 10th its probably realistic good be right with that mark absolute pleasure as always ill see you again next week enjoy the game well i hope so unless i have another miserable game week then i might retire and no dont say that have to do it bloody handy that this all good its all good thanks right ill see you again good night for me night everyone,25096
16,fplblackbox,W7RXnwehNsE,FPL Not Enough | GW4,2024-09-16T20:07:27Z,[Music] [Music] [Music] it's game week four it's Sunday morning it's absolutely glorious Sunday morning and I'm still very much riding the high of forest 1 n win at anfield yesterday I'm just a little worried that when that high wears off I'm going to wake up screaming and bursting into tears at the fact that Harland again wrecked my game week with a double figure return it's just absolutely incredible I don't know I mean obviously I'm beginning to near the point where I'm waving the white flag on Harland I look at it now and think probably enough couple of game weeks is all I can go more on that and a set but let's look at the stats from City 2-1 win over brenford it went how I thought it would to be honest close game in terms of result brenford took that shot lead through V's goal I had him on the bench third on the bench of course no luck there um but um yeah I was never going to start him at Man City over Robinson at home to West Ham so I forgive myself that and harand got the brace of course um XG have w 1.11 six shots in the game he's now had 20 shots over the season that's almost double ever any other forward and 73% of his shots have been on target 45% of them converted into goals that that's not sustainable Mark of course that's what I keep telling myself that's what I told myself in blackbox this week if you saw it but he just keeps delivering he's an absolute machine and if anything City without foden um without other goal options in the side really and foden does provide the other main source of goals I would say it's just all about Highland it's all about feeding Harland even more than we've seen before and he looks in Peak physical condition absolute you know the fear he's causing in defenses I mean pincky just pushed off the ball for that second goal it wasn't great defending but that's what you're going to get against harand he's just a beast and it's Arsenal at home Newcastle way so I guess I can take some consolation that perhaps I can wait two game weeks before I have to make the move but then the game we seven definitely eight I need to get in there because of City's fixtur so it's getting close to the moment where I have to kind of concede the feat on that and see if I can ride out the next two game weeks elsewhere in the game kdb again showed up well but um came out of it with nothing 3.38 xgi now for the season that's the most of any midfielder uh and in terms of Team selection Lewis did start he started on the left and inverted even though Walker was in the side bought back on the right but um then he was subbed at halftime leis Fardo and this is what we're going to see now I think with European fixtures on the agenda for Pep he's going to play of his lineups more and everything we thought we knew about their team which looked quite settled we're going to have to relearn a bit now that the European fixtures are are with us as for brenford wher picked up the injury and that's a blow for early adopters like me who need in for game week six onwards when brenford fixtures really turn we'll have to see how bad that ankle injury is what does that mean it could mean starts for Sharda who replaced him up front it could mean LS poter plays there does it impact in bmo's output could do this would be a big loss let's face it so we'll have to get the prognosis from Frank on that and then the other thing of not set vandenbberg is he going to be the for in Defender that we need I mean brenford fixtures are great people are presuming now that he's got that start but they do play three at the back against the harder tires so against easier opposition the type of opposition you want a brenford Defender for it's not certain that vandenbberg starts I think he I think he probably will claim start because he's a quality player and I might if I was ward in now I might take a risk on him but we need more info we need a couple more games before we can be sure for brenford run that Vandenberg could be the formula option of choice if he does drop in that' be great for [Music] us see if Salah had delivered it wouldn't have been so bad for me and and certainly for for others who have backed Salah over Harland but obviously Salah got a lot of traffic going into the game week as well but I watched The Forest game and Forest just contained him and Diaz really well I mean the fullbacks were outstanding Salah was very quiet he had three shots Diaz had one but neither really threatened that much Diaz had that one chance that Yates gave up which perhaps he could have done better with but a blank for the Liverpool attack uh and for Trent obviously with the H and Ado goal Trent created four chances and you know it's just a bad day for Liverpool there's no fear going into Bournemouth walles Palace and Chelsea that Liverpool assets won't reward us but I think what I saw in that game was real concern that Salah could so could so easily be shut down if you like I mean for has played well but there is certainly much more chance that Salah is going to be stopped than Harland it seems based on the evidence we've seen so far um and Forest I mean maybe I'm underestimating them and I'm trying not to be biased as a forest fan and and back Forest too much but defensively we were excellent and that's two clean sheets now and SS with five saves as well Moro made his full debut now if I was going a forest Defender it probably would be olena um because I think you know the fact that Moreno played left and Ana moved to the right that's a sign of things to come I think Ana has got the right back slot and he's more natural out there but Moreno his attacking qualities are going to be really tempting if he can now down that start and he was outstanding I just don't see um I don't see him giving up that left back birth now so Forest could be worth a look they they're up there with the defensive date last season they're up there this season and maybe I need to like not do you know not do them down because I'm a forest fan but actually see them for what their potential is in fbl which is perhaps a very solid defensive unit uh let's touch on a player that did deliver and that was OE Watkins I mean we went into this period of fixtures for Villa thinking that Watkins would be a target for us we were put off by the fact he's been taken off on 60 Minutes in in most of the games not so this time I mean Villa had to push they went two nil down to Everton Everton again letting that twoo lead go um but um yeah Watkins played his part with a brace of course um and then Duran with a wonder goal Watkins had six shots 1.25 xgi um and it's what we expected really over that period of those fixtures but we were just hesitant weren't we but now going forward um the fixtures remain good for Villa um and it's walls in its witch next and you got to think that yeah would you move to Watkins I guess he could be an alternative now certainly the captaincy for those who did were brave enough to put him put it on him got rewards um certainly you're going to hold your Villa assets aren't you and that includes Rogers who who is turning into somewhat of a troll it's ironic that the the classic troll Dina got the assist for the first goal and then we got Rogers in the team who just seems to be flirting constantly with with returns in fbl without actually delivering um I think he had three shots one chance created looked impressive again but came out of the game with absolutely nothing Elsewhere for Everton not too much to say really defensively they remain a real noo so pford just isn't going to be doesn't look to be an option for us and at 5 million perhaps he wasn't anyway the only other thing I note for ever is C becoming an option 5.9 they've got Leicester Palace Newcastle and that's a good run um if we need a 5.9 Striker maybe Cal L is someone we got to consider but at the moment confidence in that Everton Camp's got to be a concern [Music] [Music] enough a blank for eza and um heartbreak for me because he was my transfer in for first Smith row uh again he flirted with returns 0.80 his XG in the game but came out with nothing um he's had 18 shots for the season I think that's second only to seeno um from midfielders but no returns and significantly didn't take the penalty that maretta converted to get his brace very painful for me that with as having Mareta of course um so I mean after the game glasner said that they've got two penalty takers and they decide on the pitch so that's a lot of use to us isn't it but as an EO owner expecting to get penalties a part of his appeal that that is a little bit of a concern now but of course his data remains fantastic maretta um got four shots on the day 0.58 XG excellent performance by him but overshadowed in terms of the data by enet who made his debut with with six shots uh 0.57 he looks promising and the three of them as a front three look you know really quite potent uh are going to cause people problems and I think you know you're going to be holding your Palace assets going into these next two games it's Man United and everon they should be out of profit and score goals in those games whether they K clean sheets though is another matter Henderson a very popular four five option at start of the Season that fought for the first goal um and yeah I think the defensively Palace don't look sound at all it's in attack that we're going to remain [Music] invested Bruno owners get a return at last in the 3-0 win at sampton um five shots one chance great the data was there again for Bruno 0.57 xgi in the game but I guess that the early adopters are are looking to move away from him in wild cards now because the output just hasn't been there for him and United as a team um you know just not attracted investment at the moment Z she was the uh top performer for XJ 1.17 but came out of it with nothing gacho got a goal Off the Bench the6 chances created so the data is there but I just think in terms of attacking assets we're not going to look at United at the moment I it's Crystal Palace Spurs and Villa so the fixtures really aren't in their favor either um clean sheets maybe they've kept two now so maybe the defense with theit of course getting the goal um so maybe defensively that's where we would go on United but with those fixtures probably not yet as Southampton the the headlines for them if there were any were around the budget assets 4.5 diblin made his debut in Midfield looked really Lively won a penalty that was missed by Archer uh and he could be an answer if you're looking for a far five option maybe you go him over Winks but of course from a 4 five mid you're looking for a short start and I don't think we can say that much yet diblin is a good player I think he will break through and now down to start because he did look their most exciting prospect and most creative um Outlet in the game I would say until he was subbed elsewhere har Bellis was um benched which was a surprise as Russell Martin moved to for at the back and I guess that's a concern now although he has got stay of execution cuz Steven's got the red card he'll be out for free games so if you are a haror Bellis owner you're okay for now you're getting the way of it for now but um I think his future as a 4 million asset for us is in doubt if it wasn't already given how many goals they're conceded [Music] [Music] [Music] strange game at Bournemouth um Chelsea got the the win bit of a smash and grab with a late goal Redemption Arc for in kunu and for jayen Sancho I guess Sancho getting the assist for inu's goal obviously be flooding out of teams in recent game weeks due to the expected minutes but came off the bench of 18 minutes to go took the goal well um but just a bizarre game overall not a lot you can take from it I mean I was on pal watch but really disappointed by what I saw no shots one chance created um and this is the problem like if if Harland isn't going to dominate as a captain we're going to need players like Palmer to step up and that wasn't really a good audition for our teams what we saw at Bournemouth and just some stats based on this season versus last minutes per xgi this season 1 94.4 compared to 98.4 last season and okay that includes penalties but let's look at touches in the Box it's it's 1.8 this season so far compared to 4.1 last season so we're not seeing as yet data or the it test to convince us that Palmer is going to be a second tier asset that can make it worth spreading the funds if you don't have Harland and Salah um so yeah I'm I'm concerned about Palmer at the moment I'm not going to make the move West Ham Brighton Forest next so you're going to you're going to hold on to uh to your Chelsea assets but um I don't know uh I want more from Palmer for sure as for Bournemouth seeno and tavanir still remain good 5.5 targets um seeno had three shots in the game it just wasn't bourus just bourus night was it and Chelsea managed to grind out the result Sanchez the leading perform on the night with the penalty save 15 points well done if you if you move to Sanchez in the wild card or before uh and perhaps defensively that's where we're going to look at moresa side at the moment but only just one clean sheet it's early days and like I've been saying in all these videos that's a work in progress and I'm just not going there [Music] yet so F and one westand one was a more predictable result uh in the game week I I don't think so I exactly what I expected really um no massive standouts from it Smith row came out with six points got the assists for the goal and of course I went into the game we excelling in Forza so I lost out there but yeah's he's doing exactly what we'd expect from a 5.5 asset he showed up really well three shots three chances created was subed again on 73 minutes so his his expected minutes is a bit of an issue but he's clearly the the best asset for Fulham at the moment and um alongside Robinson I guess in in defense Robinson had his clean sheet cruy taken off him um by that last minute goal or late goal by Danny Ying set up by boen um and I guess the other point of note was munes was dropped to the bench and it's not surprising really he 43 shots of had a goal he had been struggling I think he he'd had um he was second to Harem for shots I think he still is even without playing yesterday um but R jenez came in got his goal and I think it's it shirt to lose now while he stays fit so that's a problem if you got on munz as your six million Striker option I think you've got to move off him now um elsewhere West Ham not too much to attract to attract to us to them at the moment I mean boen is going to be a differential over the season at some point but just not yet I don't think it's Chelsea and brenford and the fixtures just haven't been great for West Ham for us to consider them the final game was was Brighton and itswitch which we expected to be a comfortable home win but itswitch put up a a real strong away performance to get another valuable point and um the goals just didn't come atoma did okay fre shots 0.67 he was the top xgi performer out of the game um but Brighton just couldn't couldn't break through that that rear guard and um it was dap who hit the post fit he's showing up okay as as a cheap Striker by the way and when the fixtures now turn for it which maybe him and Davis are worth a look as for Brighton no Jal Pedro was the headline of course came back from International Duty we thought he was going to get some minutes but didn't even appear he's got a knock I don't think it's serious and and of course the fact that Brighton didn't take their chances didn't score it should bode well for him to come back in against forest provid and of course that injury isn't more [Music] serious all right I'm going to go back join the family and then get back on watch the north London derbyan wolves Newcastle next I've got four players yet to play son sacka Reya and isaach oh God I need something from them I mean best case I would be what 20 plus points worst case scenario eight or nine really need them to come in for me otherwise it's going to be one of the worst game weeks I've ever had I think I'm ranked like 9 million or something in the game week at the moment and as he's living it up after his Harland Hall and maretta points so yeah it's going to be a miserable Black Box in the week for me unless I get something today so let's hope that best case comes in eh 19 points in not what I needed but good enough I suppose in this game week was so many blanks about um sacka was seven points Ry with nine and then just a couple was s then one from isach talk about that in a minute but yeah sacka came in with the set piece 0.40 he was top X dve performer on the day but it's not enough for him he's a 10 million asset I need more and then the same than son one shot one chance created 0.17 XT that's just not good enough I mean with hard being so dominant we need more from those assets to really justify not just going har and Salah so yeah it's a problem for me that's for sure and I've got to look at what I do with son long term as for sakur he got a knock but I think he'll be okay I don't think he's made of tungsten and he he's going to be fine he plays 90 minutes most of the time and and Arsenal flog him so I'm sure that he's going to he's going to be fine for game week five um what else in the game yeah Gabrielle exploiting the set peace threat um really hurting know who benched him or even sold him for this game I can see why people did low and played porro for example porro you know he's second to Trent for chances Crea for defense he's he's top for shots so the attacking threat was there but against this Aral defense just they never looked like breaking through did they and so yeah Gabriel with 15 points of that that probably hurt quite a few people out there that I've seen um and then Rya I mean what would I do without Riya again clean sheet and two bonus five saves he's with turned an average of two bonus points every time Arsenal kept the clean seat so far which wasn't what we expected but I thank my lucky stars that he is in my team because he is really plugging the gaps at the [Music] moment suay concluded with walls one Newcastle 2 real real again Newcastle not looking great but managing to get the result um thanks to Barns coming off the bench and hitting a wonder goal at the end um I guess the the headline act here is that he that was off at half time he took a blow to the face and and how said after an eye injury he'd already gone down overnight to uh to 84 and and now another price drop could be on the card for him I think I think I have to hold him and and hope that game week five he be fine for the for the Fulham game that's a fixture where he could do okay and Newcastle just finding a way despite not playing well but it's like I've said before it's these teams Chelsea Spurs Newcastle these are teams that are giving us Assets in that mid to second tier bracket they need to be playing better than they are um because until they do find some form and some fluidity we can't expect the light to vak and son and Palmer to make the contributions that we need them to at the price bracket they are so I'm going to look at more of that in Wednesday's blackbox we'll be doing blackbox on Wednesday a bit earlier not looking forward to it cuz I go into blackbox for the first time in ages being behind as by 20 points it's it's a strange feeling I don't I don't like it um so a is going to be celebrating I'm going to try and keep the show short so I'm going to go off now and watch that Hudson Ado go another 15 times to cheer myself up don't forget to like And subscribe and see you next time,3919,its game week four its sunday morning its absolutely glorious sunday morning and im still riding the high of forest 1 n win at anfield yesterday im just a little worried that when that high wears off im going to wake up screaming and bursting into tears at the fact that harland again wrecked my game week with a double figure return its just absolutely incredible i dont know im beginning to near the point where im waving the white flag on harland i look at it now and think probably enough couple of game weeks is all i can go more on that and a set but lets look at the stats from city 21 win over brenford it went how i thought it would to be honest close game in terms of result brenford took that shot lead through vs goal i had him on the bench third on the bench of course no luck there but i was never going to start him at man city over robinson at home to west ham so i forgive myself that and harand got the brace of course xg have w 111 six shots in the game hes now had 20 shots over the season thats almost double ever any other forward and 73 of his shots have been on target 45 of them converted into goals thats not sustainable mark of course thats what i keep telling myself thats what i told myself in blackbox this week if you saw it but he just keeps delivering hes an absolute machine and if anything city without foden without other goal options in the side and foden does provide the other main source of goals i would say its just all about highland its all about feeding harland even more than weve seen before and he looks in peak physical condition absolute the fear hes causing in defenses pincky just pushed off the ball for that second goal it wasnt great defending but thats what youre going to get against harand hes just a beast and its arsenal at home newcastle way so i can take some consolation that perhaps i can wait two game weeks before i have to make the move but then the game we seven definitely eight i need to get in there because of citys fixtur so its getting close to the moment where i have to concede the feat on that and see if i can ride out the next two game weeks elsewhere in the game kdb again showed up well but came out of it with nothing 338 xgi now for the season thats the most of any midfielder and in terms of team selection lewis did start he started on the left and inverted even though walker was in the side bought back on the right but then he was subbed at halftime leis fardo and this is what were going to see now i think with european fixtures on the agenda for pep hes going to play of his lineups more and everything we thought we knew about their team which looked quite settled were going to have to relearn a bit now that the european fixtures are with us as for brenford wher picked up the injury and thats a blow for early adopters like me who need in for game week six onwards when brenford fixtures turn well have to see how bad that ankle injury is what does that mean it could mean starts for sharda who replaced him up front it could mean ls poter plays there does it impact in bmos output could do this would be a big loss lets face it so well have to get the prognosis from frank on that and then the other thing of not set vandenbberg is he going to be the for in defender that we need brenford fixtures are great people are presuming now that hes got that start but they do play three at the back against the harder tires so against easier opposition the type of opposition you want a brenford defender for its not certain that vandenbberg starts i think he i think he probably will claim start because hes a quality player and i might if i was ward in now i might take a risk on him but we need more info we need a couple more games before we can be sure for brenford run that vandenberg could be the formula option of choice if he does drop in that be great for us see if salah had delivered it wouldnt have been so bad for me and certainly for others who have backed salah over harland but salah got a lot of traffic going into the game week as well but i watched the forest game and forest just contained him and diaz well the fullbacks were outstanding salah was very quiet he had three shots diaz had one but neither threatened that much diaz had that one chance that yates gave up which perhaps he could have done better with but a blank for the liverpool attack and for trent with the h and ado goal trent created four chances and its just a bad day for liverpool theres no fear going into bournemouth walles palace and chelsea that liverpool assets wont reward us but i think what i saw in that game was real concern that salah could so could so easily be shut down if you like for has played well but there is certainly much more chance that salah is going to be stopped than harland it seems based on the evidence weve seen so far and forest maybe im underestimating them and im trying not to be biased as a forest fan and back forest too much but defensively we were excellent and thats two clean sheets now and ss with five saves as well moro made his full debut now if i was going a forest defender it probably would be olena because i think the fact that moreno played left and ana moved to the right thats a sign of things to come i think ana has got the right back slot and hes more natural out there but moreno his attacking qualities are going to be tempting if he can now down that start and he was outstanding i just dont see i dont see him giving up that left back birth now so forest could be worth a look theyre up there with the defensive date last season theyre up there this season and maybe i need to like not do not do them down because im a forest fan but see them for what their potential is in fbl which is perhaps a very solid defensive unit lets touch on a player that did deliver and that was oe watkins we went into this period of fixtures for villa thinking that watkins would be a target for us we were put off by the fact hes been taken off on 60 minutes in most of the games not so this time villa had to push they went two nil down to everton again letting that twoo lead go but watkins played his part with a brace of course and then duran with a wonder goal watkins had six shots 125 xgi and its what we expected over that period of those fixtures but we were just hesitant werent we but now going forward the fixtures remain good for villa and its walls in its witch next and you got to think that would you move to watkins he could be an alternative now certainly the captaincy for those who did were brave enough to put him put it on him got rewards certainly youre going to hold your villa assets arent you and that includes rogers who is turning into somewhat of a troll its ironic that the classic troll dina got the assist for the first goal and then we got rogers in the team who just seems to be flirting constantly with returns in fbl without delivering i think he had three shots one chance created looked impressive again but came out of the game with absolutely nothing elsewhere for everton not too much to say defensively they remain a real noo so pford just isnt going to be doesnt look to be an option for us and at 5m perhaps he wasnt anyway the only other thing i note for ever is c becoming an option 59 theyve got leicester palace newcastle and thats a good run if we need a 59 striker maybe cal l is someone we got to consider but at the moment confidence in that everton camps got to be a concern enough a blank for eza and heartbreak for me because he was my transfer in for first smith row again he flirted with returns 080 his xg in the game but came out with nothing hes had 18 shots for the season i think thats second only to seeno from midfielders but no returns and significantly didnt take the penalty that maretta converted to get his brace very painful for me that with as having mareta of course so after the game glasner said that theyve got two penalty takers and they decide on the pitch so thats a lot of use to us isnt it but as an eo owner expecting to get penalties a part of his appeal that is a little bit of a concern now but of course his data remains fantastic maretta got four shots on the day 058 xg excellent performance by him but overshadowed in terms of the data by enet who made his debut with six shots 057 he looks promising and the three of them as a front three look quite potent are going to cause people problems and i think youre going to be holding your palace assets going into these next two games its man united and everon they should be out of profit and score goals in those games whether they k clean sheets though is another matter henderson a very popular four five option at start of the season that fought for the first goal and i think the defensively palace dont look sound at all its in attack that were going to remain invested bruno owners get a return at last in the 30 win at sampton five shots one chance great the data was there again for bruno 057 xgi in the game but that the early adopters are looking to move away from him in wild cards now because the output just hasnt been there for him and united as a team just not attracted investment at the moment z she was the top performer for xj 117 but came out of it with nothing gacho got a goal off the bench the6 chances created so the data is there but i just think in terms of attacking assets were not going to look at united at the moment i its crystal palace spurs and villa so the fixtures arent in their favor either clean sheets maybe theyve kept two now so maybe the defense with theit of course getting the goal so maybe defensively thats where we would go on united but with those fixtures probably not yet as southampton the headlines for them if there were any were around the budget assets 45 diblin made his debut in midfield looked lively won a penalty that was missed by archer and he could be an answer if youre looking for a far five option maybe you go him over winks but of course from a 4 five mid youre looking for a short start and i dont think we can say that much yet diblin is a good player i think he will break through and now down to start because he did look their most exciting prospect and most creative outlet in the game i would say until he was subbed elsewhere har bellis was benched which was a surprise as russell martin moved to for at the back and thats a concern now although he has got stay of execution cuz stevens got the red card hell be out for free games so if you are a haror bellis owner youre okay for now youre getting the way of it for now but i think his future as a 4m asset for us is in doubt if it wasnt already given how many goals theyre conceded strange game at bournemouth chelsea got the win bit of a smash and grab with a late goal redemption arc for in kunu and for jayen sancho sancho getting the assist for inus goal be flooding out of teams in recent game weeks due to the expected minutes but came off the bench of 18 minutes to go took the goal well but just a bizarre game overall not a lot you can take from it i was on pal watch but disappointed by what i saw no shots one chance created and this is the problem like if harland isnt going to dominate as a captain were going to need players like palmer to step up and that wasnt a good audition for our teams what we saw at bournemouth and just some stats based on this season versus last minutes per xgi this season 1 944 compared to 984 last season and okay that includes penalties but lets look at touches in the box its its 18 this season so far compared to 41 last season so were not seeing as yet data or the it test to convince us that palmer is going to be a second tier asset that can make it worth spreading the funds if you dont have harland and salah so im im concerned about palmer at the moment im not going to make the move west ham brighton forest next so youre going to youre going to hold on to to your chelsea assets but i dont know i want more from palmer for sure as for bournemouth seeno and tavanir still remain good 55 targets seeno had three shots in the game it just wasnt bourus just bourus night was it and chelsea managed to grind out the result sanchez the leading perform on the night with the penalty save 15 points well done if you if you move to sanchez in the wild card or before and perhaps defensively thats where were going to look at moresa side at the moment but only just one clean sheet its early days and like ive been saying in all these videos thats a work in progress and im just not going there yet so f and one westand one was a more predictable result in the game week i dont think so i exactly what i expected no massive standouts from it smith row came out with six points got the assists for the goal and of course i went into the game we excelling in forza so i lost out there but s hes doing exactly what wed expect from a 55 asset he showed up well three shots three chances created was subed again on 73 minutes so his expected minutes is a bit of an issue but hes clearly the best asset for fulham at the moment and alongside robinson in defense robinson had his clean sheet cruy taken off him by that last minute goal or late goal by danny ying set up by boen and the other point of note was munes was dropped to the bench and its not surprising he 43 shots of had a goal he had been struggling i think hed had he was second to harem for shots i think he still is even without playing yesterday but r jenez came in got his goal and i think its it shirt to lose now while he stays fit so thats a problem if you got on munz as your six million striker option i think youve got to move off him now elsewhere west ham not too much to attract to attract to us to them at the moment boen is going to be a differential over the season at some point but just not yet i dont think its chelsea and brenford and the fixtures just havent been great for west ham for us to consider them the final game was brighton and itswitch which we expected to be a comfortable home win but itswitch put up a real strong away performance to get another valuable point and the goals just didnt come atoma did okay fre shots 067 he was the top xgi performer out of the game but brighton just couldnt couldnt break through that rear guard and it was dap who hit the post fit hes showing up okay as a cheap striker by the way and when the fixtures now turn for it which maybe him and davis are worth a look as for brighton no jal pedro was the headline of course came back from international duty we thought he was going to get some minutes but didnt even appear hes got a knock i dont think its serious and of course the fact that brighton didnt take their chances didnt score it should bode well for him to come back in against forest provid and of course that injury isnt more serious all right im going to go back join the family and then get back on watch the north london derbyan wolves newcastle next ive got four players yet to play son sacka reya and isaach god i need something from them best case i would be what 20 plus points worst case scenario eight or nine need them to come in for me otherwise its going to be one of the worst game weeks ive ever had i think im ranked like 9m in the game week at the moment and as hes living it up after his harland hall and maretta points so its going to be a miserable black box in the week for me unless i get something today so lets hope that best case comes in eh 19 points in not what i needed but good enough in this game week was so many blanks about sacka was seven points ry with nine and then just a couple was s then one from isach talk about that in a minute but sacka came in with the set piece 040 he was top x dve performer on the day but its not enough for him hes a 10m asset i need more and then the same than son one shot one chance created 017 xt thats just not good enough with hard being so dominant we need more from those assets to justify not just going har and salah so its a problem for me thats for sure and ive got to look at what i do with son long term as for sakur he got a knock but i think hell be okay i dont think hes made of tungsten and hes going to be fine he plays 90 minutes most of the time and arsenal flog him so im sure that hes going to hes going to be fine for game week five what else in the game gabrielle exploiting the set peace threat hurting know who benched him or even sold him for this game i can see why people did low and played porro for example porro hes second to trent for chances crea for defense hes hes top for shots so the attacking threat was there but against this aral defense just they never looked like breaking through did they and so gabriel with 15 points of that probably hurt quite a few people out there that ive seen and then rya what would i do without riya again clean sheet and two bonus five saves hes with turned an average of two bonus points every time arsenal kept the clean seat so far which wasnt what we expected but i thank my lucky stars that he is in my team because he is plugging the gaps at the moment suay concluded with walls one newcastle 2 real again newcastle not looking great but managing to get the result thanks to barns coming off the bench and hitting a wonder goal at the end the headline act here is that he that was off at half time he took a blow to the face and how said after an eye injury hed already gone down overnight to to 84 and now another price drop could be on the card for him i think i think i have to hold him and hope that game week five he be fine for the for the fulham game thats a fixture where he could do okay and newcastle just finding a way despite not playing well but its like ive said before its these teams chelsea spurs newcastle these are teams that are giving us assets in that mid to second tier bracket they need to be playing better than they are because until they do find some form and some fluidity we cant expect the light to vak and son and palmer to make the contributions that we need them to at the price bracket they are so im going to look at more of that in wednesdays blackbox well be doing blackbox on wednesday a bit earlier not looking forward to it cuz i go into blackbox for the first time in ages being behind as by 20 points its its a strange feeling i dont i dont like it so a is going to be celebrating im going to try and keep the show short so im going to go off now and watch that hudson ado go another 15 times to cheer myself up dont forget to like and subscribe and see you

17,FPLFocal,USzbfmj7ID0,FINAL FPL THOUGHTS | GW5 | INJURY NEWS ⚠️,2024-09-20T13:12:47Z,welcome back for another video final video of the week then we're going to recap all the latest news from today's press conferences and we're going to answer all your biggest ffield dilemas and questions for gami 5 let's get into it help mbappe win with his fantasy football team and let's prove that FPL managers are the best fantasy managers anywhere in the world so rare is a free-to-play fantasy football game it's kind of similar to fpl but he pick five players every match with a few twists mbappe's got a rivalry gun of his little brother the prizes are actually insane right now when shirts signed by your favorite players VIP tickets to match is so rare cards to use in games or if you can score 400 points you can meet mbappe himself so I'm just doing my team now since I know the Premier League better than other leagues that's how I'm going to do my team mostly so Allison in goal I'm going to go with Trent as my Defender Salah is not a midfielder in so rare so I'm going to go with Bellingham he's home to espanel and then uh I've got a limited Salah card from a couple of years back so I'm going to use that and then I'll go with Robertson as my extra so all in on Liverpool basically and then Salah Captain this week click the link below to play free and enter a team now I've played years and it's an awesome game that complement FPL nicely first question from Fabian who ask who the best replacements for munes are which is also a good opportunity to discuss the best budget fors in general right now I've got three Replacements all of which can be afforded in one move Cal L vard and Welbeck Cal did miss the leag cup midweek of illness but he's back in training so he's definitely an option and he does have the best fixtures of the three vard's got two goals in four as well but he's only taken three shots while kav L's taken six while Becka's got two goals one assist he's got the best best underly numbers of the three but the worst fixtures of the three but obviously in the best team of the three long term my favorite would be Calvin Lon for 5.9 mil my got feeling is they'll get a result away at Leicester and win the game and although two and four is impressive for vardy it's from three shots as we said and you could argue the fact that it's 37 is a factor as well well Becka like only if you're going to Wild on gamei six so essentially one Meek replacement but it should be pointed out how good Forest have impressed defensively who brighten the playe they're third after Liverpool and Man City for expected goals conceded if asked to rank them in order it'd be Cal Le and vardy and then Welbeck I've seen dap mention a few times as well he does look a real talent but his minutes have been a bit all over the place he didn't make it to 60 last match Casper asks who to start between Gabriel cono and Robinson now Gabrielle off the back of a 15p pointer conso with the best fixture and Robinson with a bit more attacking threat this one's a close one but I'd go with conso the three if you've got a Defender Dilemma on the FPL focal app you can go on the menu and then go to fpl odds and you'll get the clean sheo and goal scorer probabilities every gameing from check the chance it's completely free it's quite helpful when you've got these Defender maybe even goalkeeper dilemas and obviously captaincy as well with the goal scorer odds obviously sometimes your own intuition is needed though if one defender's got no attacking threat while the other's got loads Villa have got 36% chance this week fham 22% so I'd back the probabilities here Robinson first on the bench so one piece of news today is eak how said he's taken a knock to his foot and we'll find out more today and then I'll make a decision and he says hopefully it's not too bad so Jordan asks what to do with isak the problem with how is he's infamously the worst at telling us anything helpful in his press conferences like there's every chance he's already been ruled out but it's also possible they are going to make that late call and he could start if you've got a strong option first on your bench and I'll keep him otherwise I'd cut your losses and sell him if you've got the money Watkins is a standout replacement but you're going to need not. 5 mil to fund that if you watch the experts video some of those were going eak down to a budget forward from that first segment and then Saka to Salah and then Captain Salah so let's discuss that sacka to Salah one then time is an illusion asks is sacka to Salah with gaming five captaincy worth a minus four here this one feels like a really tight call and it could have a huge swing as well if you've got isach and sacka then i' just about go for this one last season Arsenal versus City had the total of one goal across the home and the away games whereas Salah tops the goal scorer probabilties this week and the gameing projections plus you're selling isak who is a doubt I actually think harand to Watkins and sacka to Sal is also a tight one but it's a very aggressive move obviously sending Harlem with such high ownership that one I personally wouldn't do but I could definitely see it coming off if you're an aggressive FB manager as last did keep Haring quiet last season Watkins does have walls and he's showing good form now Simon asks is this real life is this just fantasy I've looked into this one unfortunately we're caught in a landslide there's no escape from reality Bernie asks if wild card in gamei 6 is a necessity it absolutely isn't as the catchphrase goes it is very team dependent while caros are going to be building towards a core of triple Arsenal bumo harand maybe Palmer maybe seeno if you've already got most of that core on your team then it's not necessity using my team as an example here in gameing six I can sell Salah and Smith Row for Palmer and bumo or I could sell Salah and Cannon for bumo and havers nether team is screaming for a wild card to be used but obviously if Shia Pedra is an ongoing problem plus if any other issues pop up in addition to Quanza already being one of my bench then it will be tempting to use it to clean up the team and to get Triple Arsenal which both are lack him gami 7 is also good C window fade Force asks about West Ham from gemi 6 onwards he says it looks like a good run of fixtures to GMI 20 so he's looking at Bowen Kudo and mavropanos yeah West Ham another one that the gaming six wild cards are no doubt going to be looking at theyve not really been in our thinking for the most part from the start of the season because of the poor fixtures but from gami six it's brenford ipswitch Spurs man united Forest Everton and Newcastle I like Bowen more than Kudos and I'd pay the extra 1.1 mil for that in defense wild CS could go for ariela and Fabian which gives you a guaranteed keeper for 8 and a half mil Emerson would be my pick of the Defenders rather than MAV Panos assuming his knee injury is not serious he's yellow flagged at the moment in right back there's Waker and soual competing so that's a nogo whereas Creswell probably won't get sniff all season in left back some other important FBO news J Pedro will train today ahead of gameing five with a late decision to made on his involvement I've got the full quote here which is he will train with the team on Friday then we'll have to see how it's going if he can train fully if he can all the movements we won't take any risks but he will be part of training H is turning into another hell here it's not particularly helpful information it's quite open to interpretation he wasn't in their league Cup squad midweek and I do wonder if we might see him benched or perhaps not even in the squad I've moved him to my bench from now my team and start a concert I'll run through my final team in a moment let us know in the comments what your feeling is on xia Pedro I ran a poll on Twitter as well and the results were as follows 39.6% say he starts 50.9% say Ben 9 and 1 half% say not in the squad at all so if there's any wisdom in the crowd here is one to think about if you had him starting in your team I'm sure in some cases you'll have no choice but to play if there's no good option on your bench but if you've got a 50/50 call like coner and Xiao Pedro which I do then using that bench is a consideration in case you missed it sackur is fine after his injury substitution last weekend he started in the Champions League against Atlanta which ended in a nil-nil draw RI saved a penalty to clinch the point he saved four of the eight penalties that he's faced now by the way Sterling came on for sacker at 7 3 minutes so sack is in line for a start against City slots revealed that Allison's a doubt for gamei 5 reported hamstring tightness and he's going to be assess today now this one's a real headache as well cuz if you've got him it's not definitive if you've got him keep an eye for some early team news tomorrow we'll be covering it as usual on the deadline stream so make sure you subscribe we have a good chance of knowing before the deadline if he's in the squad or not and if there is no news I think I'd just keep him in fact on that subject keep an eye for Liverpool news in general just in case slot benches one of Jos R Diaz a Gak played really well in the Champions League and Slot said himself he would have started him in gamei four if not for his heavy involvement over the international break and he's been saying a lot of good things about Darwin as well he's yet to get his first League start Watkins came off early in the Champions League as well and there were some fears of an injury but emry said he's working well he played well and I decided to change him like another player he's okay de bruy came off in the Champions League as well with an injury in his case there were rumors that he's out for the game against Arsenal he was asked in his press conference about Katy B and he basically gave nothing away he said he's a bit better and he said they've got training later and he was pressed on his involvement and he said he could be involved so I finishing up with my final team then it's henerson in goal it's Trent dunk porro and coner in defense Smith Ro Rogers sacka e Salah in Midfield and it's Harland up top on his own so as it stands I've bench sha Pedro for cona now if there's any early team news that quansa starts and I'll swap him in for coner instead Salah Captain harand Vice the plan is to roll the transfer this week and then spend them both in game six or wild card and take those two free transfers over with to gami 7 sck is the only one on my team with an away fixture this week which is promising thanks for watching if this video was helpful hit subscribe we'll be live here for the deadline tomorrow as well see you then,2092,welcome back for another video final video of the week then

gaming six wild cards are no doubt going to be looking at theyve not been in our thinking for the most part from the start of the season because of the poor fixtures but from gami six its brenford ipswitch spurs man united forest everton and newcastle i like bowen more than kudos and id pay the extra 11 mil for that in defense wild cs could go for ariela and fabian which gives you a guaranteed keeper for 8 and a half mil emerson would be my pick of the defenders rather than mav panos assuming his knee injury is not serious hes yellow flagged at the moment in right back theres waker and soual competing so thats a nogo whereas creswell probably wont get sniff all season in left back some other important fbo news j pedro will train today ahead of gameing five with a late decision to made on his involvement ive got the full quote here which is he will train with the team on friday then well have to see how its going if he can train fully if he can all the movements we wont take any risks but he will be part of training h is turning into another hell here its not particularly helpful information its quite open to interpretation he wasnt in their league cup squad midweek and i do wonder if we might see him benched or perhaps not even in the squad ive moved him to my bench from now my team and start a concert ill run through my final team in a moment let us know in the comments what your feeling is on xia pedro i ran a poll on twitter as well and the results were as follows 396 say he starts 509 say ben 9 and 1 half say not in the squad at all so if theres any wisdom in the crowd here is one to think about if you had him starting in your team im sure in some cases youll have no choice but to play if theres no good option on your bench but if youve got a 5050 call like coner and xiao pedro which i do then using that bench is a consideration in case you missed it sackur is fine after his injury substitution last weekend he started in the champions league against atlanta which ended in a nilnil draw ri saved a penalty to clinch the point he saved four of the eight penalties that hes faced now by the way sterling came on for sacker at 7 3 minutes so sack is in line for a start against city slots revealed that allisons a doubt for gamei 5 reported hamstring tightness and hes going to be assess today now this ones a real headache as well cuz if youve got him its not definitive if youve got him keep an eye for some early team news tomorrow well be covering it as usual on the deadline stream so make sure you subscribe we have a good chance of knowing before the deadline if hes in the squad or not and if there is no news i think id just keep him in fact on that subject keep an eye for liverpool news in general just in case slot benches one of jos r diaz a gak played well in the champions league and slot said himself he would have started him in gamei four if not for his heavy involvement over the international break and hes been saying a lot of good things about darwin as well hes yet to get his first league start watkins came off early in the champions league as well and there were some fears of an injury but emry said hes working well he played well and i decided to change him like another player hes okay de bruy came off in the champions league as well with an injury in his case there were rumors that hes out for the game against arsenal he was asked in his press conference about katy b and he gave nothing away he said hes a bit better and he said theyve got training later and he was pressed on his involvement and he said he could be involved so i finishing up with my final team then its henerson in goal its trent dunk porro and coner in defense smith ro rogers sacka e salah in midfield and its harland up top on his own so as it stands ive bench sha pedro for cona now if theres any early team news that quansa starts and ill swap him in for coner instead salah captain harand vice the plan is to roll the transfer this week and then spend them both in game six or wild card and take those two free transfers over with to gami 7 sck is the only one on my team with an away fixture this week which is promising thanks for watching if this video was helpful hit subscribe well be live here for the deadline tomorrow as well see you then,2074
19,FPLFocal,9rhIEl1QeqI,FPL GW5 EXPERTS TEAM 🚀,2024-09-19T11:34:17Z,welcome back for another video we're back with the experts video as we look at what the top managers are doing with their teams this week they transfer playing as Captain see in the experts team between them all they finished first in the world once top 100 four times top 1K 44 times and top 10K 367 times so hit subscribe to benefit from all this data every week this season kicking off with the manager highlight and Gams moved to top of the experts league with a score of 76 points which takes him up to 40K overall he's also the big score in the league last game the average score in the experts League was 50 points it's been overall challenging and unpredictable start to the season Lucas s f analytic makes really interesting charts plotting how the elite thousand do each season which is basically the top thousand alltime managers and this season they've started the slowest since he started recording the data with an average rank of 2.2 mil but you just know in about 15 game each time they'll have caught up in fact if we look at last season that was the previous slowest start ever but they still had the best average final rank in the top 000 managers averaging 30k between them all so the climb is on if you keep making good decisions eventually the variance will swing your way so don't get Reckless with your decisions or go on tilt so what's the plan this week then 68% to Rolling the transfer 20% to making one move 12% of making two transfers no chips active this week among the experts it is a good week to roll if we're able to because of the fixture swings coming up in game6 FPL is all about trying to stay ahead of the curve double or triple arsenal when the home to Leicester is huge upside gameing six and theom is going to be a very popular move as well given their fixture run and obviously from gami s Man City have got full and woles Southampton Bourn and Brighton if you haven't got Harem then you'll need those transfers and it'll be a priority then many are eyeing up a gaming six wild card but now that we can roll transfers into wild cards taking two or more to the other side of it it's going to be very powerful so which players are they buying and selling this week the top transfer in is Salah 13% of the experts have bought him if you've got an easy route to Salah it seems worth it where it gets trick is whether it's worth harand to Salah if you're going to walk on and game six anyway as that's two moves for a one we play basically and you're sing the most own player in the game which obviously carries a lot of risk though there is huge upside in the play like that Salah non-owners let us know in the comments whether you're going to be getting him or not and if you're doing it how are you doing it 14% are selling sacka who's The Logical one though he has assisted every Arsenal goal this season besides the one he scored himself and he's yet to blank away at Man City though so it is a sound move this week 11% of B and vardy 7 % to buy calv Leen both of these teams are hitting a decent stretch of longterm fixtures and they both got two goals to their name Cal L's also got an assist and all of his returns coming in the last two games I prefer him to VY personally but it's pretty close vy's taken three shots and he scored twice so those aren't really sustainable numbers I do recognize he's a poacher Cal L's taking six shots if you are looking at Cal Leen wait till the press conference is as he been a sickness bug sweeping through the Everton camp and he did miss out midweek in the League Cup 7% to B Watkins this week who is a player on the rise after a slow start to the season a brace last game and he's still got good enough fixures to buy him he's got wolves I switch man united fulman Bournemouth so isak's the most sold player 14% of selling him very unfortunate for owners last game he took a ball in the face and he had to come off cuz he apparently had an issue with his eye you'd expect him to be fine and recovered for game five against Fulham though lots of those buy and seller are going isach to one of those cheap forwards so there's calv Leen vardy Welbeck jaia Pedro Archer Wheatley and then they're making the second moov sacka to Salah which players have been delivering the most promised after four Gams a day to them harland's 5.03 expected goal bom is highest in the league so far and it's de bruy Salah Watkins and seeno de bruy owners have been really unlucky so far and on top of that he was taken off at Hal time in the Champions League to keep an eye on that if you've got him he might have a knock we're still waiting for foden to get going as well having been used pretty sparingly so far we saw just how good the upcoming fixures are and if he does start against Arsenal then he could be an option for gaming six or gamic seven if you want to wait and see if he starts against Newcastle seeno leaps off the page here given how cheap is relative to the other players near him he's got Southampton home in gamei 6 leester away in gamei 7 5.6 mil McNeil also a notable one here given those upcoming games 2.57 expected goal involvement he's created Five big chances which is the most in this list bum's 3.43 expected goal involvement also impressive given that they faced Liverpool and City already all the data tables here are available in the Scout members area use a link L below to get 40% off and take advantage of all the other tools there as well no chips active this week but a very quick chip overview then so 75% have still got their Wild Card 100% still have their free hit unsurprisingly 98% still got the bench boost and 88% still have the triple Captain I wouldn't be surprised to see 30 or maybe 40% wild card in gamei 6 to catch those fixture swings let's move straight on to gami 5 captaincy then there's actually five names this week which caught me by surprise however it's still very one-sided 80 5% to go with Salah against Bournemouth and then it's Harlem with 7% Watkins 4% Palmer 2% son and vardy Captain by one each as far as the anytime goal scor probability salah's top this week he's been given a 45% chance of scor in anytime then it's harand 39.5% son Watkins both on 37% so what do reviews projections say this week then it's got Salah comfortably ahead on 7.7 points and then it sun on 6.4 Palmer 6 Harem 5.6 despite the blanking gami for Salah still enjoying his best ever start of the season for FB points after four games that's crazy when you think about it given that it's his eighth year at Liverpool and he started better than when he broke the all-time record for FB points with 303 moving on to the experts team which is comprised of the most owned players across all their teams for the template team basically it's Henderson in goal it's Trent coner and POR in the back three the Midfield five is Rogers Salah e j and Smith harand is jaia Pedra up top so Salah Captain harand Vice how many players have you got from the team this week there are a few issues starting to emerge obviously Henderson and Go's been really disappointing mun has lost his spot up top it's almost certainly going to be himz again isak does actually have higher ownership than Moonis but to keep the team with budget we've got mois in joshu and Diaz is expecting minute to decline in as well gakpo was unbelievable in the Champions League when he started ahead of Diaz J started and he came off early didn't have a great game and of course there's no Arsenal players here ahead of game6 either so we'll see a huge number of wild cerss active on next week's edition so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss that onto the experts final thoughts and tips for gami 5 here's what they had to say this week Joe Jenkins says most likely move for me is Moon is but I might end up taking a hit or even deciding the Wild Card depending on the press conference updates regarding isak and KY B injuries and possible jot rotation I don't think it's a great week to wild card but I may have my hand forced meaning I'd have to just get a wild card six Squad a week early most likely FPL cholo has taken a onewe punt he says calculated Risk by bringing in son to Captain I don't have and I can't get to him without a hit so I'm hopeful that sun can match or better Salah and Harem this week planned wild card in gamei 6 Benny M90 has sold harand and Gibbs white for Salah and salanki and he says this might be the time for a trip to DFS to buy a bigger sofa for us harand sellers this week FB addict says I often find people panic immediately after a bad game League especially if they've just played a wild card my suggestion is don't forget what made you buy a player in the first place additionally I think the five free transfer rule will benefit those who stick to a good strategy allowing them to store transfers and mini Wild Card multiple times throughout the season Panic selling players will hurt your ability to do that Brian's been W up selling Munos for a one week pump but decided against it to carry the extra transfer over on the wild card and he says I'm rolling so I'll have three free transfers off to Wild Card six unfortunately I don't think it's worth the transer moving Muno to another sub five mil Defender this week so double crystal palace defense will be minimal points thanks for watching as always and thanks to the managers for sending their responses in every week see you soon for the next one,1810,welcome back for another video were

22,alwayscheating,PV0vRLn_cRk,Josh&#39;s Wildcard Passes the Point of No Returns Plus Our GW5 Preview,2024-09-16T13:28:55Z,"and and we are live now Fully live Fully live okay Heil cheaters welcome to the aam podcast my name is Josh Landon here with Brandon K Brandon how are you I'm good Josh we've got a lot to talk about you coming off your wild card I think I had this idea that I like kick things off with a little Holland talk um but I feel like we'd alienate like some very sensitive listeners right off the the bat I mean has has the time come for everyone just to make peace with earling Holland Are We There Yet I mean it's a weird week for it right because he's now on the you know it'll be what it was nine goals in the first four matches and yet I am actually planning not to Captain him this weekend in place of a player who blanked this last weekend um so it it is a little odd isn't it like uh I you know it's it's just a funny thing because I do feel like he's kind of like break the Premier League thank goodness Arsenal won today just regardless of your thoughts on North Lanta Derby and like fandom aside right like kind of feels like if Arsenal lost that like the title might have already been kind of I don't know people like hate when I say this it's very interesting actually because it's a it's a real American versus British thing in my experience like Americans we operate in a place of like this is like as a as sports fans at least like this is it actually funny because I feel like the the British national character in general General is kind of Ry very defe perhaps yeah yeah exactly kind of sarcastic but when it comes to sports or Sports as they say take off the ass there's sort of a feeling like Hope Springs Eternal and if I say stuff like the Premier League is over four weeks in there'll be people get extremely mad at me for saying that right whereas in America it's sort of like a thing you do right like the Tigers was it a better example like a Lions lost today right like you know this is what happened in NFL right so they're one and one and so as like well yeah season's over I guess uh I guess we're not we're not a Super Bowl Contender this year that's just the way you talk you know about about sports and it's sort of um you're trying to you have to go to the ex right yeah right and uh to make yourself sort of feel better you go to the extreme like maybe it is outlandish that I'm saying that the lion season is over maybe I'm overstating it therefore the lion season isn't over it's sort of a reverse Jinx exactly and it's it's but it's like not even in the moment I it's not a conscious thing right I I sort of um I really actually hate the intentional reverse Jinx you know I I have been accused of this before on our our Twitter but to me it only the reverse Jinx only works if you're truly not trying to do it right if you were if you were genuinely in a in a place of usually it's like a place of Anguish like FPL related anguish where you're like nope this is not going to happen there's I'm not going to get anything out of whatever you know ex player this week and then then you get the the Glorious R like George castanza said it is it's not a lie if you believe it exactly so that's where you're at with the reverse J all right so um yeah I think it was a very International Breaky sort of game week and I think basically just looking at the past completion of mosala is that post International break feeling in a nutshell uh it was it was crazy watching him and and many other players in Liverpool's Sabas Li was having this issue as well and this was a very it was just a very underbaked performance by Liverpool but credit to Forest Ana what probably for me had the best performance of the weekend he was unbelievably good in that Liverpool match and at 4.4 suddenly I'm Ana curious yeah I mean we we talked about Forest a little bit uh like right before the intern I guess it was like our pod after gameweek three before the international break and about how we thought they they could give um Liverpool a little bit of trouble uh this this upcoming weekend just because there's there's a lot of quality on that like you know it's like it's a team that's for all of the kind of um they felt like they were like a kind of Proto Chelsea a couple of years ago right where it was like they just kept adding more and more players to the squad but it's sort of like they kind of shed the ones that didn't work and they found the a combination that does and and there you know I think it's quite quite a easy team to like now uh but I thought they but yeah I I agree I mean I actually was surprised that Sabas got the full 90 uh I guess there's not like a fantastic replacement for maybe but I thought he was terrible I thought he had a like a really poor match and uh the announcers felt that way too it was like I think AG yeah everyone agrees not a great match uh no the the real comedy of that match was uh Diaz and Joda both getting subbed at the same time and Joda taking 10 seconds faster to get off the pitch which meant that Joda got off the pitch at 5957 and Diaz got off at 607 or whatever it was and uh it was like J had ordered an Uber from the center circle was like I I got to keep my festar rating and I can't keep this guy waiting it was brutal because you saw it it's it's it's such a fantasy moment because you you saw the three players lined up right and when they they showed them all line up and they said they're they're right by the the you know the fifth official right and so you know it's like it's it's going to come or fourth official whatever it is you know the official what is it is the fourth fourth official yes fourth official right because you got the two linesmen I guess would be two and three and then this the uh onfield red ref right right see the this is the fifth official and uh oh yeah yeah what am I think like The Fifth Element I don't know where I am yeah so fourth official they're they're lined up and so you see that and you're like okay and you kind of already knew like Sal is not leaving the pitch right it's like it's got to be it's got to be Joda and then you're like yeah maybe Diaz as well and then then they kind of I think they actually even announced so the announcers knew the change that so they knew what was happening then you see the ball in play right and so you're like all right we just need an extended stretch here where where the ball doesn't go out of play little bit of Head tennis maybe yeah and it was like I I it's so funny I remember this so well from yesterday and it was like and I think Forest got the ball and somebody on Forest immediately Uncorked like a 35 yard screamer that that you know missed the net by 27 feet and uh and at that point it was like you know 3922 and I was like well like there's no there's no way we're getting this like these guys had to be like at the extreme end of the pitch for this right very very Frau too because uh Bradley was coming on and so there was an assumption that Trent might be coming off clean sheet then he stays on and you must be thinking great we lock the clean sheet in I don't know I don't know about locking the clean sheet but but certainly I was like at least I get more chances and like now I get Trent Feld right uh but no in the end he ended up with exactly one point he could have gone at 59 or he could have gone off at the end either way he ended up with a one pointer just a weird uh match from Liverpool um I it does feel like I I was listening to like the totally football show or something like that and they were actually like the worry now is they were almost too good in the first three matches and it gave people a sense that they might be further along in the kind of restarts or you know retooling whatever you want to call it uh with with Klo out and uh I think I I mean it's hard to say right because in some ways this team is fundamentally the same as as last year right I mean who is who would even be the kind I mean like some players are more beted in I suppose but it's I mean even Spas was there last year right I can't think of a single player in the starting lineup who was a new sign yeah yeah exactly so um yeah so I don't know you know it's sort of um it I mean the the real issue for me and I I've shared my screen here although actually while I'm on the transfers page for some reason I think I was literally just absent mindedly hitting buttons as I was talking to you um yeah I mean I wild carded in um all these Liverpool players and uh and you know it just it just it really obviously didn't work out if I had just gotten the clean sheet I would have felt okay about it right but um I did think Trent had a pretty good game all things considered and he is in the zone clearly right now he had a great International break and there was a a corner in which he went for goal basically he went for olympico and he was like well within his rights CU he's just so dialed in so as far as sh shelling out the money for Trent you still have to feel pretty good about that I mean I don't feel good about it because it didn't work out and I and I wild card out of a better team to to so like yeah sure I have these players now like maybe eventually they'll be good quickly run through the team for people listening no you know I think it's fine I I you know I have uh Kaa stunk lost the clean sheet right away way uh Trent got one point uh Robinson lost it like what the 90th minute and 30 yeah like 90 plus three or something like that it was like the like the last boot of the game basically lost his clean sheet uh Henderson uh lo you know conceded two to Lester awful performance yeah it kind of feels like Lester are just gonna score one or two in every single match like I actually they might I I honestly feel like unless they get a point penalty like a massive one I I think they're probably gonna end up staying up this year because there's just they're just they just have enough like they can score goals I I I always you know this is just like my like my like rule of thumb which is that if you have a bunch of teams that are all kind of near the bottom of the Premier League table and like any one of those teams that they're capable of scoring goals is going to be the team that stays up versus the uh the other ones well it ain't Southampton I can tell you that much no poor Southampton it's like you know they almost feel like an example of a team that got promoted like like a year or two early you know it's like they weren't quite it's like it's sometimes it isn't good news to get I mean obviously it's good news from like a bottom line standpoint but as a fan and honestly I'm not even from a bottom line standpoint You could argue that there's there's there's a case for waiting like trying to keep your you know powder dry or something like that right I mean there's always the risk that you just don't ever get up right and that is the that's that so you always have to of course go you know go all out to to get promoted but it does feel like there are times when it's like you need to go to back down to the championship reset right like I mean Fulham we talked about this before but like Fulham like it was like the third time was the charm with them right like you know and they seems like they have a lot of stability now it's a real Alchemy particularly when you're working with a lot of Lone players and there's you you have to have some level of continuity uh in in addition to some elements of luck etc etc so um I feel like when we looked at your wild card team when we did our patreon pod on Thursday night I was struggling to find any issues with it yeah I thought it looked really strong in every position yeah decent rotations no real weaknesses I mean Matt Turner as your backup goalkeeper is the only guy who's probably not gonna get 90 um in this in this lineup totally and I and I you know so I rolled out a 352 I got uh blanks from every one of my Defenders my goalkeeper and every one of my midfielders uh yeah an 0 for nine uh from those and one of my starting forwards didn't play Jaa Pedro and uh I sort of lucked out because I definitely lucked out uh because Johan Wisa came on uh scored 24 seconds into the match got two bonus even though he subbed off in the 45th minute so um so that feels like a stroke of of Good Fortune kind of you know and then of course I had had Holland and Captain him so all told I wild carded and I'm down like 550,000 spots uh so clearly um you know a disaster but um you know it's like a house it's like you know it's like buy an old fixer upper I like the bones of this wild card it's got good bones so I just need I just need it to turn into um you know points eventually but yeah it's I mean it's a bummer I'm four weeks in now you know 1.5 million overall and I think the worry now is is this another season like last season where I feel like I I like the team that I've put together and then every week um it all goes you know um right you just end up Treading Water really yeah yeah exactly but it's way too early to think that like I know I was talking earlier about being pessimistic I but I don't feel overly pessimistic I just um you know Rogers again it's like another match Rel looks good and but I mean there's nothing happening with him you know it's just it's he's not I don't know it's like if it's if I I don't know forgive me if I'm if I'm mentioning this again um on the podcast but there's this Tik Tok feed I like where it's all of these um they're all like French guys I think and they all take turns uh scoring like they all kind of like it's like they all do it's like they all like it's like a kind of Challen right and so it'll be like a um you know top bins and then it'll be like two touch volley you know and if you get it you get a check mark if you don't get a whatever right um and so these guys it's like no one in the world is better at hitting the crossbar or the post than these guys right and it's like they're incredible at it occasionally they do go in but they are Masters that accidentally like you know hitting the crossbar but getting so close yeah and it's like but it's like they're all just these dudes and it's like kind almost feels like the difference between these Tik to that guys as like the Premier League guys like the Premier League guys somehow know how to get it in you know sort of and I'm just like it's Morgan like Morgan Rogers like if you're if you were capable of scoring you should have scored by now you know I don't know it's like at some point like it's it's more than just bad luck right it's like he's kind of I don't know it's like the Gabriel Jesus thing like do we is Gabriel Jesus on a 10-year run of not being able to convert chances or is it just that he's not very good at scoring you know I don't know Morgan Rog is like to beat another metaphor to death feels a little bit more like when you first get the new FIFA video game and your virtual pro is just has like no skills and you have to slowly build them up like Morgan Rogers like his aim was either directly at the goalkeeper or off to the side there was a great moment where he could have just teed up Ali Watkins for a tap in and the pass was just so Off the Mark um yeah so it had a one one he yeah he had a one-onone he couldn't convert weird match for Watkins too I mean he has the brace uh first goal he scored I thought was a really good goal second one was was was I I suppose a bit lucky right it sort of I think it takes a tough touch off the defender and kind of loop straight into his path he almost can't he he almost couldn't miss uh with the second goal and then uh uh but then he missed some like really big chances and then uh you know D is it Duran or Duran Duran yeah Duran um you know Duran comes on and uh and scores a great goal uh we actually a lot of great goals this this whole weekend I I was watching the highlights from the um I had some play date related responsibilities St so I couldn't watch the um the Newcastle Wolves game har Barnes incredible but all all three of the goals were great yeah every single one of the goals scored in that match was was fantastic um because even the Wolves goal was great because it had this great kind of um like a like kind of dummy on the on the goal it was really really cool um so um yeah so this is sort of there was a question uh that we had for this week's pod I think I had it down at the bottom but um you know it's uh Jimmy uh ragd dog Town asked what I'm enjoying about this FPL season so far and I would say again for me what I enjoy is is watching the Premier League and and then fantasy is like the it's like the thing that I sweat through in order to give you know it's like I would say from a fantasy perspective I it's more um it's like I don't know I'm not always having a great time from a fantasy perspective for me like watching the matches perspective I am almost always having fun like yesterday there's so much going on it's very stimulating it's really fun and I and if I didn't have fantasy I would um I just don't think I'd be you know was watching as much right you know it's like I wouldn't be carving out the time for it and I but it really does bring me a lot of Joy watching these matches every day you know every weekend it's a blast FPL is like somebody in a dark alley that's like hey buddy you like watching Premier League well have you ever watched Premier League like this exactly you ever smoke this and watch the watch the Premier League yeah exactly yeah I mean that's I think that's that's kind of true I mean from a from an actual FPL perspective I mean this is a bad week for me to answer that question I think um you know the the thing I always love in fantasy like like everybody I think is to have um you know have players that nobody else owns who Who deliver and so um I did have a little version of that I had Johan vissa this week and um I'll take those seven points and uh and and that'll be my little bit of Joy this week for my own Squad right is the the Visa bench boy so I will stop talking about my team now why don't you talk about yours because you it's funny actually because I was thinking about this earlier today and how I was like I'm gonna say something to Brandon it's gonna sound insulting but but I don't mean it this way uh or not not completely at least uh but I think that you really like this week was you showed the benefits of sitting on your hands right there there are times when making no decision is the best decision right and I think that that's um something that you um yeah that you can you know first first I was like did you get 70 points this week I was like d dang I ended on 55 points so yeah you and I you and I talked on the main podt last week and you had triggered your wild card and I was like go with God that's not for me uh I've got my Newcastle guys maybe I'll get lucky with the north London Derby then we talked on Thursday and I was losing my nerve there was the international break injuries to odard to CL rice I was like what what performance are we going to get out of Arsenal this weekend conso had this little bit of a doubt even though he was uh past fit on Friday uh and I just had this insane fomo not having a single Liverpool guy so there was this inkling that you know I was as you said Josh being passive so in fantasy you can be one of two things you can be patient or you can be passive and the difference is like patience is I'm trusting the plan that I've set forth and you know even though I'm going to be tested let's just carry it through and then there's paity where you're just not recognizing the situation that you're in you don't make the necessary changes and you get you get destroyed because of it and I was fearful that not getting any Liverpool in in particular was going to mean that I was managing passively yeah so do you think it's like an eye of the beholder thing one man's passive is another man's um patience well it's it's a it's a hindsight thing I'm able to say that it was patient because it worked out for me that's that's what I mean leading from behind you know I think that's really um you know but now you've got now you've got two transfers and uh and you I I think very very very likely I would say you ended up with a better Squad by not making a wild card right like your wild card team would not have had 55 points would be my guess for sure no definitely not and like we had talked about I was thinking of going double Liverpool defense so like I would have just been like destroyed when that when that clean sheet got got wiped out so I do feel like I'm in a stronger position now I have to answer the the question lingers of like well so what am I going to do with Liverpool now I at least have the opportunity I doesn't look like the uh Price Market is going to be really fluctuating too much this week while we've got these Champions League fixtures that are starting and there's also the efl cup so guess I'm just looking for minutes rotation any injury concerns with Liverpool with Arsenal and all these guys what's up with Saka I mean y I can't believe they FL why why what's the point of flagging Saka anymore it will make a difference always being rolled off the that is a yeah I I don't want to get away from your team but I I'll just this a quick reminder that the uh European Manch kickoff this week uh we have um Aston Villa play on Tuesday uh away to uh young boys at the wankdorf as we as we talked about last week wonderful uh and uh I think it'll be very interesting to see whether Watkins or Duran starts that match I think I think we might see Duran start it uh which would I suppose be good for Watkins owners I think you'd want him to to start that match if Watkins starts at midweek then I think we could see a Duran start on the weekend yeah um and and then Liverpool also play on Tuesday they they go to AC Milan so like you said we'll see what we see you know we'll see we'll see what we see but well you know I think I think the fact that it's Tuesday means that everyone should be fine I would love to see Joda um not start this match that would be kind of Ideal um so we'll see there I actually was very I was kind of leaning towards making the Joda to um uh to um Lis Diaz move and um was kind of going back and forth but on Friday and then I missed that Diaz was set to price rise and it's sort of like I was like ah fine yeah I I was I was debating between the two anyways and the price rise I was like I'm not gonna spend the extra point. one now uh when it was a lateral move I was kind of okay with it um yeah so um and then Wednesday Man City host uh Lil uh and then Thursday uh because there there's no Europa League or european conference League this week it's all Champions League it's spread it over three days on Thursday Arsenal go to um Italy and they um they visit at Atlanta uh and so um those are all again I have absolutely no idea how the scoring works this year in the Champions League I don't know like there's even if there's yeah if there's even a table like it's not clear to me how many of this is going to work but uh but regardless they're they're playing and uh uh so I think this will be it'll it'll be a lot of fun um just from like an individual game standpoint anyway so yeah um but Brandon I want you to talk a little bit more about your team and while you do I am going to run and get a glass of water because I am a little part I'm going to give you I'm going to give you the free rain here for a second I'm going to Vamp here all right go for it yeah so the the front line I felt like the edge that I might have is the Newcastle away wolves you know say what you will about newcastle's away form having the double up with Gordon and esok felt really good to me now there is a huge concern with esok he's now flagged in the game Eddie how after the match said that um esok mentioned he had blurry vision in the locker room at halftime and they're not quite sure at least at the time of this pod what's going on with him and hopefully it's not serious but it's it's very concerning and um who knows what his Fitness is going to be going into gameweek five so suddenly is esok to Ali Watkins is ESO a make way to get cash to make it easier to get Salah in and keep Saka because right now the Assumption with my team was always the only like the easiest way for me to get Salah in is to get rid of Saka and Saka Fitness prud is just in uh terrific form he's returned in every game we so far we'd love to see a few more goals from him but um I I think there's no way I can drop him even though the Man City fixture in gameweek five is really worrying uh so I guess Josh this is this is I think a big piece of our looking ahead to gameweek five and potential transfers is can we just take the City Arsenal match on the chin in recent memory it's been nil nil very tetchy not high-scoring I can't imagine Holland has every chance of scoring in in this match and Arsenal's performance in the north London Derby was harrowing I thought I thought they worked their butts off yes yeah and then they play on yeah it's I think they're in a tough spot too playing away um in Italy on Thursday um maybe you talked about this while I was yeah the schedule is brutal because then they they play on Sunday in the City match so arteta's real challenge here is protecting some of his players who had to work really hard in the north London Derby yeah can't imagine odard is fit for the City match because they had mentioned he's probably out for three weeks y I mean at least they'll have Delan rice back and watching the north London Derby I thought if rice were on the pitch for Arsenal that they would perhaps even have greater control I mean maybe what's to discuss is what's going on with an ball and why has it just like not been working for the last six months yeah I know and uh yeah it's it's it's just a weird thing with them because I continue to think they look good on the pitch and I can't tell if that's like if it's just an aesthetic thing like I just enjoy watching this version of Spurs play you know and and yet you're right I mean the results are not there right it's like they're they're playing enoy enable brand of of football I think but it's just not like necessarily translated into a team that feels like they're even remotely close to Champion you know to challenging for for a champion spot maybe when you know Solani can can um level up uh I thought he actually had some moments in the in the derby where he uh I mean he hasn't played in a few weeks right I mean Morgan Rogers did up a little bit he did Morgan Rogers it a little bit that's true yeah but my my my small moment of Joy my whs a moment was Emil Smith row coming off of my bench with seven I I had thought maybe benching J Pedro uh in favor of Smith row but thought I think it's gonna be a tight between West Ham and Fulham it turned out to be the case but heck I will take it and as as uh fantasy owners of jaia Pedro you'd love to see it not if you're a Brighton fan but Brighton couldn't they couldn't score goals hey yeah we need Jia Pedro it's j Pedro team also classic classic premier league right the the classic um unannounced injury right just absolutely no obligation to ever I this is like my like my biggest Bugaboo and I bring it up all the time but it's just CRA like why would anyone ever tell the truth why would a premier league manager ever like I mean they could just go out there in a press conference on Friday and be like Osaka's injured he's out for three weeks uh you know we uh you know uh celba won't play for us again there's no downside to that right like what is the what would be the like would you even get in trouble for that like you can literally say anything and there's no there's absolutely no obligation because no one tells the truth everyone hides all the all these injuries it happens again and again and so Xiao Pedro has a knock like no you know who who knew not not us you know so yeah it's a little tricky so what is your what is your plan right now then I mean uh you have you have these two transfers uh so presumably you're not leaning towards a wild card at the moment because no you know no the plan the plan was prior to this game week that I'll probably shift Saka to Salah and now I just feel like Saka is immovable I'm just so enamored of his form and and Arsenal interesting yeah um So the plan is I think like the easiest move just based on like knee-jerk is ESO to Watkins or the alternative would be I can do Dogo jot to moala if I use my second free to move ESO down to somebody who's 4 or I'm sorry 5.4 mil or cheaper is there anybody Jamie VY okay I mean that's interesting is you can get vardy for 5.4 yeah he is 5.4 there's also Ral himz who looks like he's won maybe I mean it's one match um but I think against West Ham he offered more than I think Rodrigo mun has been offering at the start of the season so R gimenez is kind of interesting but I yeah Bard is 5.6 by the way he's gone he's gone the wrong way he's I mean as well he should he should have R it in price I mean he's Sublime song all of a sudden um yeah going the wrong way so can you can I see uh and we'll we'll say it out here because I don't again I don't want people listening to to not know but I'm just curious what what your squat oh actually no before you make any transfers I'm just curious what your team looks like what's your what does your bus team look like right now hit by a bus uhhuh my bus team looks like this I'm benching Emil Smith row who three flags yeah so did you see this news about esok I was just talking about this while you're getting water but the blurry vision it's really worrying double double vision yeah it's a was that song right like with my double vision at forer I think of I'm your huckleberry uh oh yeah yes exactly Kilmer and Tombstone Doc Holliday yeah yeah um So the plan the the plan could be drop esok and and get hins and then maybe Roll Another transfer the plan could be that double move I was mentioning where jot becomes Salah and I downgrade ESO but I think what I like I just I'm I'm liking having this flexibility up front with a M like a upper mid tier second forward that yeah gives me like I wonder how you're feeling because you to go with the the strong Midfield you yeah can't seamless easily get to a player like Watkins I mean yeah that that is true although it's not it's not impossible it's two transfers so You' have transfers yeah um yeah and I and I would like to have him but I I I'm like sort of okay with not having him just because of all the Champions League stuff and and the fact that he now has such a quality backup option what about another move so just looking at your squad I mean I think your defense looks great right you've got Kap poro and Robinson back there uh Henderson and go fine uh I mean f whatever they're all bad every every Keeper's a bad except for except for ederson who gets us like he got his one assist a season you know so congrats to him for that Sanchez for Chelsea had a excellent game this weekend but you know we don't need to talk about that's he did actually that's true yeah credit to him he saved a pen and and uh they kept a clean sheet although they really shouldn't have kept a clean sheet I thought Bournemouth were I thought kind of unlucky in that one but yeah yeah they they do they dominated for stretches for sure yeah so good good with the defense yeah but then in the middle you've got you got Rogers who at this point you know it's just like whatever he's 5 million like there's no point in getting too mad about a 5 million player it's the only joke is that we keep starting him in the face of these returns but I mean like you know like you got Smith row on the bench like I actually probably play Smith R over I feel like that's pretty obvious I'm going to make that switch right now I agree I guess I guess your bus team um had him on the bench last week so that's probably what it was um I mean I actually think in some ways the could you move Gordon in down to a 4.5 fiveish player and then and then turn Joda into um um into into um Salah yes I I I believe I can do that I have 2.4 mil in the in the bank let's you know let's just try that for for fun if I move jota to Mo and I drop Gordon how much do I have in the bank I have 46 so that's actually not bad I mean you know it's I mean you could get a player who actually starts at least at 4.6 like not like just a a straight up like like someone who moved to you know um Saudi Arabia or something you know and they're just like they're like red flag for the rest of the season yeah this is the question different routes to Salah is that what I need to do and well I feel like you can't let uh one that one performance against Forest just put you off Liverpool like we still have those first three matches in which they looked amazing as did Salah Salah just like if Salah was actually able to complete a pass against Forest he probably looking at some fantasy returns and I don't think we're having this conversation so it does still still feel urgent to me it's a little bit like the Holland thing like the non Holland owners are now having to have like real talk of just like am I gonna persist with this strategy in the in the face of logic yeah absolutely and I think the the problem um I was just thinking about your your specific team you know part of the problem with those movies we just discussed is even if you made those you actually still have three flag players that would be starters right uh in ja Pedro isach and Saka now all three of them should start right but like you're sort of like you know it's like if you multiply 0 75 time 75 time it's like you're started you're you're kind of in a position where just something's goingon to go wrong you know and it's like do you want to like get rid of all of your kind of cushion of of bench players you know so yeah I think I think it's I I don't really know I mean that you know and I can see why moving Saka now maybe does make a little less sense because if you look at Arsenal's fixture run you can just survive gameweek five with Saka right it turns into can you see this on my screen I can yeah it turns into a you know a spectacular Trio of fixtures right from game weeks 6 through eight where they host Lester followed by Southampton away to bour they're almost too good where it's like if it was someone besides saki you'd worry about rotation but that artetta refuses to rotate Saka so we should be fine with him and so like in my case my plan is to not make a transfer this week if I can avoid it right like barring some Champions League injuries so that I can bring in Saka myself starting in game week six um and so uh in my case it would it would also be Joda that I would be shipping out to fre Cas for that yeah it's interesting uh what's going to happen in the midweek and the midweek is further Complicated by the efl cup you've got Everton Southampton brenford fham Palace man united uh Brighton wolves and Spurs all play in the efl cup midweek so have your antenna up for rotation injury Etc and yeah I guess I guess like you've you've pinpointed it with Watkins is with Duran and such good form how much of a transfer Target is Watkins if he starts and plays 90 in the Champions League and I I would be surprised if Watkins doesn't start in the Champions League because this is a dream moment for his career yeah I think I think that's right um yeah it's they it's an interesting Squad like are they part of me is like I actually think they probably are good enough like I mean like are they deep enough to like because for a lot of squads that when you especially the champions league but even like the Europa League for some teams right this kind of happened to Brighton a couple years ago where it's like it really can kind of upend your season right because they just don't have the the depth to to rotate um because there's just too many you know even when they try to rotate those can be matches that they then lose which means then you have to play everybody right and then suddenly you're playing your best 11 twice a week for on and off for three months right and that's when that's when your form comes to dip but I think they do have enough depth it just kind of depends on uh um yeah I mean I guess the question is just how much is that even Morgan Rogers right like I mean it's not like there's no reason for us to think that he's so locked in that he couldn't get uh get rotated this this coming weekend sure and it's almost like him being left on for the full 90 uh against Everton it's sort of like Amry is like you're not part you could read you're part of the Champions yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah let's let's let's hope I think um all right so let's uh oh I wanted to because we actually had a proper game week where everything ended on Sunday I wanted to quickly shout out the always

$500 gift card so big thanks to bluewire for that all right Josh game week five it's time to put the disaster that was game week four in the past yes exactly I I'm surprised that I'm not feeling more I'm actually feeling kind of fine about how gameweek four went like it was not a good one but um I don't know doesn't the I feel like the first game we after wild card it's like you you look at your squad going into the the game week you always feel good about it and it never quite works out right and so sometimes it's like it's it it takes two weeks for a wild card to really like settle in um and so I think that's that's that's how I'm feeling about things and I think when it comes to gameweek five the big question I I you know I I would say arguably the biggest question right because it's it's the place where you can get double points right is what do you do with Liverpool and you and specifically mosala versus Erland Holland right so Erland Holland is uh I think masking some deficiencies in this man City squad right now like you know we started to get into the top of the pot and I think we got distracted but I it really does feel like he is so good that it it's like it's hard to even tell how good man city are it's like it's very clear how good Erland Holland is right and um like because I felt like like brenford had like they could have scored three goals in the first half of the match they not they were not pushovers in that match for sure not all a couple of crazy moments and I think by the end of the match brenford kind of ran out of gas and that's the thing with city is they just have a really deep bench and can keep their foot on the gas for the entire 90 minutes absolutely this this is what unlimited money buys you and I think that's fine you know and we're not going to get into that on this issues yeah exactly exactly but I do think um from a fantasy standpoint uh the fact that there's one player who is so good that the flaws of their I mean obviously Man City are are when I say flawed I mean that only in the sense that like they haven't dropped a point this season and and maybe there maybe there's a you know you're comparing them to the heights that they hit you know the last decade basically exactly it does not feel like they are um it feels like they are maybe slightly lucky to to be on 12 out of 12 to start the season and so yeah and I really hope and I I worry a little bit now that um with with odard with odard out and uh Arsenal playing away in Italy on Thursday uh Man City play a home match in the Champions League the day before against what I was probably an easier opponent as well in Lil versus Way Atlanta I think Atlanta's gonna give them a Arsenal really tough match I'd actually be surprised if Arsenal won that game um and so I think that it's you know it's gonna be a tough um so they're going to be coming you know coming off of that um and you know I think it's going to be a real OD pill battle for them um does that translate into lots of returns from earland Holland well I don't know about that right like I mean I think that um we saw with Arsenal today in the north lond Derby right like Arsenal they know how to limit chances they know how to limit chances their defense is incredible David Rya he had another spectacular save in this one and it's just incredible like some of the best saves I have seen from a keeper like that the I thought the saveing Thea Derby and the saving the uh Villa match um just like the best saves the season and uh so like even so it's like even even even though I also think like you just sort of organizationally they're really strong it's a really stable back line I mean I guess the left back spot has has had a lot of different people in there but uh but in general it's like they're just so solid and then that like you said before they have duckin rice back and so uh do I think the man that score in this match yes do I think they score more than two goals no right uh but I think they probably do score two and and then if they score two then well yeah I mean if they score two then Holland's going to he's going to score one of those two goals right and then maybe maybe both and uh and so it kind of feels like again I like to talk about these like kind of floor ceiling things when it comes to captaincy right so the ceiling for Holland I think would be around 13 points uh right two goals and three bonus that's just I mean obviously I'm just guessing but like you know that's like a reasonable rule of thumb I think um heuristic Brandon is that's what that's the that's what I'm going to use for this um yeah and uh but I think uh his floor I guess it's a blank I don't know it feels hard to believe doesn't it let's say I can't I refuse to give him that low of a floor I'm gonna give him a goal and no bonus so his floor is six points I would say his range is six is six to 13 roughly uh and then if we go to Liverpool uh bounceback game clearly I I can't imagine the play is poorly field again Salah had by far his worst match the season he was Irrelevant in the match basically um just a weird one from him I I I don't like you know he wasn't really creating chances for other people it was just one of those weird matches kind of it was like one of those matches from last season where he just like he wasn't involved and um I mean I don't I mean like I I'm I'm sure he had a couple of moments but I mean I watched all you know 90 minutes of that game you know and I don't remember I just don't remember seeing him really like you know there's always moments when they're in the box and things like that but it just didn't feel like he like took control of that game if anything I thought um Diaz was was the one he had that amazing moment on the touchline yeah where it looked like the ball was going to go out and he won the ball like maybe he should have passed it but when they when they showed the the replay you can see he's got clear space near post right there and he puts it right off the post I agree exactly yeah inside post too it was like it was really really my thoughts on solah in that match were particularly toward the end it felt like he was just trying to do it for him and yeah mo mo is playing for Mo and I think that's what has traditionally made Mo such a special player as he's just like I'm going to do my thing and it's gonna be great but y you know to be sort of conspiratorial uh or read try to read too much into this performance is this a pivotal moment for Arie slot and does he do some weird stuff um does at doesn't the attitude change at Li pool cuz Arie doesn't strike me I'm I'm going to call him Arie I think that's fine yeah um he doesn't strike me as a guy who puts up with BS and he kind of he's trying to really exert his this is the impression I get from his press conferences and the postmatch interviews the impression I got another great song turned into a great try to knock on wood um more singing on the always anyway so I think Arie slot's in an interesting position here and how he resp response and it's kind of like good for Liverpool and for slot that they have the Champions League fixed year to shake that rust off deal with whatever that's that's a very you're right and that it's sort of interesting like in Arsenal's case you maybe don't want this match on Thursday but in Liverpool's place in Liverpool's case they probably do want a chance like they they want a big match right away right you want to G of get the taste of that Forest match off of you so yeah I think that makes sense um and I think they're going to look a lot stronger on Tuesday I think the big question and the reason why everyone should be holding their transfers um as long as possible this week is um there's you know I mean Liverpool have made a couple of depth moves um over the last uh you know like the last month or so of the Season like do we you know do we see some of these players come on I mean like there's some there's some quality players in that side who have like barely played so far this season right like yeah like kesa has kesa gotten on the I think don't think maybe yeah I was trying to like remember if like got the Premier League at least I don't yeah he's he's still in zero zero minutes so uh obviously he joined late into the into the window too but yeah so kesa has barely played Darwin has barely played gakpo has barely played um and and these are quality I mean Cody geko is arguably you know like well he was in the I would say in the in the first 11 of best players in Euro 2024 right he was absolutely fantastic uh he basically plays in the Louis Diaz spot I think when he's at his best right as a sort of classif as a forward actually in the game but I I think he kind of plays I think he's I don't know I think he's very strong in the left he likes to come from Deep right yeah and he's I mean he's a Dutch player right so he can like he's you know he could play anything from Center back to yeah executive forward but um you could see him I think starting in place of Diaz or possibly Joda um you know midweek for sure it probably probably deserves to honestly Darwin I'm not as sure about like would you roll out a Darwin uh a Darwin gakpo double front line I'm assuming that salid will start just because yeah you know just I I can't imagine him not starting this one yeah Sol is just so fit that's not a concern I have he will play 90 forever for eternity uh Darwin does seem like nobody respects him at that club for maybe some of his teammates to but I don't think slot showing him a whole lot of respect I don't think he's going to get a start no yeah I mean Darwin's in that category remember that those those French ticktockers I was telling you about before you know he's the ultimate oh man this guy would kill on there like the way the crossbar would rattle when he was trying to score in this uh these challenges oh my goodness he'd knock it right off the tumble over you know backwards yeah I would I would love to see that actually um so I think uh yeah so what is salah's range of returns uh this weekend I think his floor would be like Five Points like it' be think he gets some kind of like an assist Maybe uh and I think his ceiling is pretty high honestly I think I think you know a couple goals and an assist and Bon it like I do think that like that's a possibility like just I just think he's got a higher ceiling than than than um Holland does right uh this weekend um and so I think um you know so if the if the floors are roughly the same and the ceiling is probably a little bit higher if you have both of them I I think that would I would tip towards um Captain inala over over Holland I don't think I don't think the argument is that strong like it's not open and shut in my opinion right like given Holland's like form like just given the form that he's in you can make a case that you can literally just cap him every single week and never said those exact words uh earlier in the week too yeah yeah yeah exactly and I and I don't mind that I just think because I have Salah it feels it just feels silly to me not to not to Captain him for what is so clearly an easier fixture um and he's obviously capable of returning as much as you know as much as as much as if not more than Holland and so so this is kind of an interesting question I think for a lot of listeners who don't have both you when you triggered your wild card was there ever a moment in which you thought you would not have both Salah and Holland no and I wouldn't have wildcarded if I didn't want Salah right like the Salo was the inspiration for the wild card right right so I guess the question then is as we look at the captaincy for gameweek five if there are managers out there who don't have both holla Holland let's call the let's call it like a like a c yeah yeah if they don't have the double up with Holland and Salah is this a problem going into gameweek five um no I don't think so um I I don't know I mean I I think that like it's not like a it's not like a minus four minus8 like level I think if you can like in your case you can get there but not quite easily enough to probably justify it right um like given given the way you just explained it to me before sure I I'm weakening my team in another position to get Salah so the math is am I strengthening my team enough just by getting Salah in that it's worth weakening my third my second Striker position I mean honestly if you could if you could do it with like if you could if you could have still afforded vardy then I might have been like in favor of it yeah because didn't you say that you needed you had like 5.4 available it made me that I just Mis remembered how much uh vardy cost I'm going to try to make these just like see if I can make these transfers right now I'm going to bring VY in for ESO yep uh and then we'll see if I can afford Salo vardy is right there just below Nico Jackson 5.6 and jota I have now 12.7 in the budget and Mr Salah how much does he cost it's got to be less than that right 12 126 he cost 12.7 exactly I have exact money and Salah so I think that's that's I'm interested in it 100% And and VY um Lester host Everton uh as well uh so the problem is you're you have exact money but I would be really reluctant to to use two transfers before all of the champions league and efl Cup matches this week right sure yeah I don't want to do that either agree it may be a Gordon downgrade situation in that case right yeah that's true yeah uh but I do think that um I think that I think we should be probably talking a little more about vardy um as a as like a a third as a as a you know as a third forward option I just think that he is uh I thought he was I honestly thought he was watched and uh and now now I'm not so sure I don't know like I mean he's it's I mean like it doesn't feel like he should be able to keep it up right like he's 36 or something like that and he's but he is clearly the it's like it's like he's it's he's like in One Last Ride territory right it's like this is this is it you know this is like the uh he's 37 he'll turn 38 this coming January so he'll be 38 before The Season's outred it's amazing right and so like but he's 37 he's got two goals it feels like he could have even more right it's like he's sort of he he's just he's exactly the same player he always was right like give him half a chance and he's probably going to score and it's like I mean God like imagine if I I don't keep keep I don't need to keep negging these guys imagine if Morgan roggers and Darwin were just able to hang out you know Shadow like like a work training program if they could just Shadow you know B for for a week just like ring their with so much red bull and Skittles yeah exactly that's true it might only work for him really you know it's it's like that yeah it's like it's like someone's got like a weird style at like like in your office right and it's like they're kind of disorganized and they deliver you're like well it works for him yeah exactly I don't like it but it works for him yeah um all right so I think that um are there any other Captain option SE Captain options besides um besides those two yeah maybe MAA I think that you know you you know how much I love Jo mcneel gold and assist this weekend what's the deal people are now like sniffing around Everton how does that performance while the the McNeil performance was really really strong no no shots at him but yeah what Everton are doing this season is just a disaster class and I don't I don't think I could justify going near them well no I mean I I think it would just be the uh I mean I I you know having just wild card I I have to say I really was not tempted um to have I me they do have a nice run I I mean I I gu I mean dway McNeil is probably fine it's just the problem is like dway McNeil is like a pretty you know what I'm I'm I forgot I was sharing my screen here but just out of curiosity I'll pull up Dwight mcneel here um I mean he's a pretty known commodity right it's not like he's been around for many years now and uh I mean this is what his if we count this like one minute that he played in 2018 let's not count that we'll just say one two three four five six this is now his seventh year in the Premier League right so I I don't know that he's necessarily like leveled up in terms of you know what we should expect from him going forward I guess I should reset what I said there about Everton because fantasy is not always about the scoreboard it's not about the end result you'd be happy to have DC you'd be happy to have uh uh dght mcneel after this game week even though Everton continue um to drive off of a cliff so you know I guess it's it's a little more nuanced when it comes to Fantasy yeah yeah exactly I think that's the yeah yeah yeah more and less weirdly um so all right let's get to a couple questions here Brandon uh Mar B says uh which preseason Hypes can we debunk now that we're 10% into this season got are we 10% into the season I guess we are um he says I'm looking at you guys uh Barco well Barco left so I think uh uh Gordon what do we think is is the Gordon hype I think like if I were Gordon owner as yourself included must be looking to uh hit the eject button there right it's not been fun there was an interesting moment though when uh and shout out to our friend run in the YouTube chat who mentioned that that ISO got a poke in the eye uh at the very end of the first half so that I have something to do with the injury but when esok came off at halftime Anthony Gordon was moved into the number nine slot he was playing forward basically and that's yeah so the appeal is that if if ESO continues to not be able to see we might get we might get something out of out of yeah I don't know I mean I don't I I it's an interesting one Gordon could go off like he's he has leveled up in the way that mcneel hasn't necessarily leveled up I do think when Gordon got that move from Everton to Newcastle everyone was like okay but I don't really understand this and he's risen to the occasion he's putting great tot for England so but the yeah the fantasy returns have been garbage yeah and that is very frustrating mean it does make me look at Manchester United as well that they were much hyped sort of like coming into the season thinking ah they're they're making some interesting sort of like smart signings for once and that I mean Del came in and uh look very feisty this weekend but still they can't they're they're struggling to score goals and be at that like top six level Squad so I think like we can definitely debunk any like Bruno uh garnacho can't even get a start yeah I think the encouraging thing from a manett fan perspective is at least they're like they are integrating a lot of players that are interesting and young and like I actually think as frustrating as it's it must be for them right now like it's I actually think there's a lot of um I don't know like there sort of uh it's funny because I was talking earlier about how there's like I would say the Manata fans are the ones who are who actually do kind of embrace the pessimism like more than than anybody else I think I think the first the first like 10 years post Ferguson there was a lot of Hope and and then recently they're like H like I don't know I don't know anymore I guesso is that like optimistic player for United right now and as a fantasy pick kind of interesting yeah I mean there like there's just no one like more than Morgan Rogers is he yeah well everybody is he has like m r has literally no returns so far in this season yeah I mean I think uh I mean Kobe minu I think is again not not a player like I I'm recommending but like he's you know because he hasn't I mean he might be like a little too deep but like he's a he's a really good player as well and like so I don't know like I don't know uh yeah but anyway I don't think there's anything uh we don't need to name gu yeah why did we start talking about man united yeah exactly um all right so um yeah es I mean isan is is quality like it's just that um I don't know like I him like I don't think he's overhyped or anything like that it's like I I'd be very surprised if by the end of the season you didn't have 20 goals right or something very close to it just not worked out for Newcastle game week one got that ridiculous red card against Baron Diaz and that southton match ended up being like not really a big fantasy Affair and then isach comes off with this freak poke in the eye situation against wolves so it's been really we just haven't gotten the right scenario for ESI thus far yeah yeah yeah amazing for sh to come out and uh uh what what a season for him you know uh yeah um yeah so I think that it's uh I think I don't think like he's overhyped I just think yeah like it hasn't really worked out with him I I certainly feel more confident in isach than I do in in Gordon um let's see who else is in aar's list yeah gardial I mean yeah didn't even start this weekend uh probably like I don't really know I'm not sure if that was a uh you know if that was like kind of well it's still hard to say because rodry didn't start either right and so I feel like we still don't kind of know what's what's going on there I uh I was surprised to see Lewis start over him and the left back spot but um yeah yeah it's just like the whole thing I'm just like I don't yeah exactly I don't want any part of anyone that isn't uh that isn't Holland on that Squad unfortunately even even ederson I mean if ederson were 4.5 million sure right but yeah uh but he's never gonna be anywhere close to that jeep uh let's see who else uh Munos well yeah sadly Muno so for him yeah unfortunately unfortunately uh could turn around of course but yeah not not looking great uh then the roll him and a score too so it's like it's even yeah it's a little scary there for him um gayi I mean I almost put him in the esok camp where it's like gay is a really good player and he has been a totally reasonable perfectly fine kind of fourth defender in fantasy in the past right and that's kind of where I would still put him like he's what is going on with the palace team and the palace defense I don't know why why did they let their why did they let like a bunch of the best players go Brandon like Riddle Me that and like why and a center back like right before the season started they were just so fun there was there it's like that buccaneering aspect of them under Glassner seems to have gone away weirdly will it come back I don't know it's hard to say I mean it we kept thinking it would with Derby remember you know Brighton and uh and never did so I don't know we'll see and then uh Kaa I don't know what to say about that I mean it's I think ever asille is Midfield is Onana has had some really Stellar moments and he's a great player but yeah I think they've got a lot of work to still do in order to control of the games and I wasn't really impressed with the Midfield uh during that uh that match this weekend against Everton yeah I mean this was this was the worry I guess right is is when when Douglas Lise left that it was going to kind of make them like a little less like Rock Solid to the middle they've gotten away with it more or less so far I suppose I mean they did lose at home to Arsenal but um but yeah conceding two in the first half to ever they just seemed a little I don't know if incipit is the right word just like just kind of like weak you know you know to put it in the Simeone terms of like no coones uh from this side this weekend I don't know I mean they did come back and win though so you know give credit credit where it's due I suppose everybody everybody uh I mean you know it's everybody spots Everton two goals because they know that the next three are coming this make this fun for everybody yeah the pattern for everyone this season uh all right so uh oh we talked about Jimmy's question about things you're enjoying FPL so far um I like the way we we kind of ended up on that question though which is basically um try to find one thing it's like one one fantasy thing each each week one thing that that brought you a little bit of Joy um John Clovis says um well okay here we go this is a another Newcastle question I guess this is really where a lot of people are though right because L people went heavy on Newcastle and um the reason I added this though was because of his his what what he was asking at the end says I went heavy on Newcastle with burn Gordon esok but none have been uh that great I think that's true like we've had a couple of returns from um from everybody I guess but yeah um with a hard fixture coming up do I need to sell them all and suck up a minus eight so the reason I added this brand was because to me my feeling is if you're considered a minus eight this far into the season and you still have your wild card I would go ahead and just play the Wild Card I I don't really like especially because game week seven makes makes a lot of s or gameing six makes a lot of sense for for wild cards already I would just do it a week early and I think it's fine and I I think there's you know I do think that like there's a very good chance that Saka gets some kind of return this weekend right he has literally every single game we so far this season um and there's no reason for to think that he wouldn't right I me he's gonna play the full 90 most likely unless unless it's a blood bath um and uh I love that yeah and so I mean and if if Arsenal are gonna do something he's proba going to be at the center of it right so um yeah but with a triple Newcastle I find just like getting rid of them you know like Andy defra and sha Shank Redemption style like dropping little little Pebbles little grapp yard a little bit of time yeah I think that makes sense just one guy in the yard bits here and there yeah I I think that's right yeah I think I think I think I I'm inclined to agree with that U yeah yeah so um yes I think it's kind of um yeah I think that um I think I'm with you there I would not drop them all and if you really decided that you and also like the fullam match is not great but it's not a horrible match like I think a pretty good chance they score like who do you think is a better start this weekend uh I think I know the answer but I'll get anyway Anthony Robinson at home or William celba Gabriel away to um Man City I guess it's Robinson because he's just getting so far forward and sort of being a part of the attack whereas you know we know what we're getting with CBA so does feel like celba is banging on for a two-pointer this weekend feels like both are going to concede but yeah totally there's something about a little bit more fun well it depends on your taste if you if you enjoy uh sort of like imperious headers uh and and a well-kept you high line or go with CBA if you like marauding left backs go of Robinson I brought in I I I guess I brought IP switch's Greaves uh in on my Wild Card the only the only Defender who got a return but of course he was third on my bench this week and uh so yeah would you start I don't I don't think I'll actually do this but it would be tempting to start him over both of those players and they because if Swit play away to Southampton and uh that match has some strong nil-nil Vibes to it doesn't it would I do it yeah I don't know if I would but I will say it does sound fun to if you're not g to play Greaves in this match and I guess you don't have a player like gaves because you're ever going to play him right but four million fifth Defender but it's not bad yeah if they were home if they were hosting Southampton uh he'd be an auto start I think this week the thing with Southampton though like ramsdale doesn't have a reputation for being great in the air plus you know Jack Stevens got a dumb red card like the Southampton defense is a bit weakened I wonder if Greaves is a good shout for a setpiece goal against well and you know what's what's fun is you know they I don't know I don't know if everybody knows this but one thing they do in the Premier League is is it's a it's a full when they reverse the fixtures of the second half of the Season every fixture in a game week is the fixture they play in the reverse fixture so I know Brandon that there will be a week when Arsenal and Man City play where IP switch will be hosting Southampton so I will have my chance to start Greaves over over my Arsenal I love that you're committing right here on this episode of I'm going have yeah just to just to just St true to my word here it yeah all right well let's uh let's wrap things up with a couple final thoughts Brandon um how about this if you could only watch one match this weekend what match would that be Spurs brenford feels like a fun one these These are uh like you pulled that one out of a hat like that's a a shocking answer I don't know like it's it's kind of fun to bag on Spurs and they've got their issues but they have so many good players and um when they're playing well they can be really fun and the same could be said of brenford now yeah I'm curious about brenford because Momo is also on my short list of players to get in the next few weeks yeah and he like similar to Anthony Gordon was moving Central after Visa came off the halftime so what kind of uh how does zomo fit into a Visa Liss yeah brenford and then you've also got Fabio carvalo who's not seen a ton of minutes and is a really interesting attacking player for brenford and uh I so there's a lot of scouting to do in this match okay all right you you've convinced me that there's there's there's there's something there I think um the West Ham Chelsea match I think could be interesting uh just because West Ham have uh they're not it's not really like even a fantasy thing but I'm just sort of interested in how this match shakes out you know it's a little bit of a you know I mean it's it's a it's a I suppose it's a South London Derby in a way I mean they're they're not that far from each other we U you and I saw West Ham and Chelsea when we were um in in London last time yeah I guess what chelse are West London by the letter of the law I'm sure there's a fair enough animosity there some energy yeah people are like throwing things at the their phone right now as they as they hear that but um but I I think actually I think Crystal Palace Main United could be a fun one that is the final match on Saturday uh it is the 12 us 530 um UK match I think that genuinely a difficult match to handicap I would say right I think uh a lot of results are on the table here like I that feels like the kind of match that could absolutely like a Neil nil does not feel on the table like it feels like a 32 one way or the other feels very possible in this one uh unfortunately for us Dean Henderson owners but I think maybe e does something uh you know I think uh interesting like the there there was some drama about penalties with E and mateta but then uh was class trying to yeah and Mata was kind of like this is my pen and uh and and then they scored so it's hard to argue with the result but uh but it was a little bit of drama there and so um uh yeah I don't know it feels like maybe um I don't know I just I it feels like sa is one of those players who's due for like a big big explosion and so maybe maybe it in this match I think it'll be a fun one though and I mean obviously you have Man City host in Arsenal on Sunday but what's the fun in picking that as our one like that's the OB I feel like whenever we say one match to watch this weekend there is the completely obvious match and then there's the kind of other like the the fun other ones and the fun other ones are why you do fantasy at all right it's like we were talking about earlier if you didn't play Fantasy you would probably find a reason to say yes to that lunch plan with your spouse right but because of fantasy you can be like I'm sorry I've got to I've got to see whether whe uh sellur partk can be a fortress uh on you know on Saturday my wife asked me the uh we were out having dinner this weekend and she was like um yeah so like you watch like you try to watch all the games I'm like yeah I love it she's like you you love it I'm like yeah it's like my favorite thing to do and she was she was kind of like flabbergast and just like wow that's a thing that you just like love doing like like 10 years doing this uh does she think you like that you you just like the like uh uh the like tiny amount of like ad Revenue that we get from yeah it's just part of totally mercenary yeah this this is a true labor of love this that's why you should be supporting the podcast on patreon by the way patreon.com always cheating to support this uh this quick sotic uh labor of love that that is this podcast um so all right I think I think we get in things there Brandon um if I had to I guess we can do the ex dog at him to which player do I think has that dog in him this week oh okay actually I've got a good one um Leaf Davis uh the leaf inator Mr assist himself the leaf blower the leaf blower I think that he blows his way into some kind of attacking return uh away to uh Southampton um I know I said this well let's just say return because I did say that nil nil was on the table there so I think I think the floor for for Lea Davis is Five Points uh on uh on Saturday I'm going with uh inku I think inuko uh I think he starts I think he's going to demand minutes just like that was such a well taken goal and the the entry pass from sancha was was great too so I like the looks of of him against W yeah it's kind of funny it's like you can see maybe it's it's like a it's like a a soup de version of the the the U the forest thing we were talking about before it's like you can see a version of this team that's really good it's just like whether they can I mean the real question is whether they can shed the people who are it's not working for right you know like the the which I guess they kind of have done right like M seems like M played his last match you know kind of played but like it started at least know I think mesa's got the right attitude just in terms of you know just making hard decisions and being unafraid of being a a jerk about it so I could see it happening for them this season all right do you have an ex dog and him for uh for game week five yeah yeah we're going with we're going with in cucko um oh right I'm sorry you said that already y sorry about that I don't I don't want to uh go back on that pick be funny if you forgot you said that like I forgot you said it and you just came with a brand new one like on the spot that would have been would I was also think conversation yeah oh again yeah we hav really heard he he's overdue for an outside the box you know screamer so uh all right well thanks everyone for listening we'll be

Thursday uh you can find us on the Discord and we'll talk to you soon bye",16035,and we are live now fully live fully live okay heil cheaters welcome to the aam podcast my name is josh landon here with brandon k brandon how are you im good josh weve got a lot to talk about you coming off your wild card i think i had this idea that i like kick things off with a little holland talk but i feel like wed alienate like some very sensitive listeners right off the bat has the time come for everyone just to make peace with earling holland are we there yet its a weird week for it right because hes now on the itll be what it was nine goals in the first four matches and yet i am planning not to captain him this weekend in place of a player who blanked this last weekend so it is a little odd isnt it like i its its just a funny thing because i do feel like hes like break the premier league thank goodness arsenal won today just regardless of your thoughts on north lanta derby and like fandom aside right like feels like if arsenal lost that like the title might have already been i dont know people like hate when i say this its very interesting because its a its a real american versus british thing in my experience like americans we operate in a place of like this is like as a as sports fans at least like this is it funny because i feel like the british national character in general is ry very defe perhaps exactly sarcastic but when it comes to sports or sports as they say take off the ass theres a feeling like hope springs eternal and if i say stuff like the premier league is over four weeks in therell be people get extremely mad at me for saying that right whereas in america its like a thing you do right like the tigers was it a better example like a lions lost today right like this is what happened in nfl right so theyre one and one and so as like well seasons over were not were not a super bowl contender this year thats just the way you talk about sports and its youre trying to you have to go to the ex right right and to make yourself feel better you go to the extreme like maybe it is outlandish that im saying that the lion season is over maybe im overstating it therefore the lion season isnt over its a reverse jinx exactly and its its but its like not even in the moment i its not a conscious thing right i i hate the intentional reverse jinx i have been accused of this before on our twitter but to me it only the reverse jinx only works if youre truly not trying to do it right if you were if you were genuinely in a in a place of usually its like a place of anguish like fpl related anguish where youre like nope this is not going to happen theres im not going to get anything out of whatever ex player this week and then you get the glorious r like george castanza said it is its not a lie if you believe it exactly so thats where youre at with the reverse j all right so i think it was a very international breaky game week and i think just looking at the past completion of mosala is that post international break feeling in a nutshell it was it was crazy watching him and many other players in liverpools sabas li was having this issue as well and this was a very it was just a very underbaked performance by liverpool but credit to forest ana what probably for me had the best performance of the weekend he was unbelievably good in that liverpool match and at 44 suddenly im ana curious we talked about forest a little bit like right before the intern it was like our pod after gw three before the international break and about how we thought they could give liverpool a little bit of trouble this upcoming weekend just because theres theres a lot of quality on that like its like its a team thats for all of the they felt like they were like a proto chelsea a couple of years ago right where it was like they just kept adding more and more players to the squad but its like they shed the ones that didnt work and they found the a combination that does and there i think its quite a easy team to like now but i thought they but i agree i was surprised that sabas got the full 90 theres not like a fantastic replacement for maybe but i thought he was terrible i thought he had a like a poor match and the announcers felt that way too it was like i think ag everyone agrees not a great match no the real comedy of that match was diaz and joda both getting subbed at the same time and joda taking 10 seconds faster to get off the pitch which meant that joda got off the pitch at 5957 and diaz got off at 607 or whatever it was and it was like j had ordered an uber from the center circle was like i got to keep my festar rating and i cant keep this guy waiting it was brutal because you saw its its its such a fantasy moment because you saw the three players lined up right and when they showed them all line up and they said theyre theyre right by the the fifth official right and so its like its its going to come or fourth official whatever it is the official what is it is the fourth official yes fourth official right because you got the two linesmen would be two and three and then this the onfield red ref right see the this is the fifth official and what am i think like the fifth element i dont know where i am so fourth official theyre theyre lined up and so you see that and youre like okay and you already knew like sal is not leaving the pitch right its like its got to be its got to be joda and then youre like maybe diaz as well and then they i think they even announced so the announcers knew the change that so they knew what was happening then you see the ball in play right and so youre like all right we just need an extended stretch here where the ball doesnt go out of play little bit of head tennis maybe and it was like i its so funny i remember this so well from yesterday and it was like and i think forest got the ball and somebody on forest immediately uncorked like a 35 yard screamer that missed the net by 27 feet and and at that point it was like 3922 and i was like well like theres no theres no way were getting this like these guys had to be like at the extreme end of the pitch for this right very frau too because bradley was coming on and so there was an assumption that trent might be coming off clean sheet then he stays on and you must be thinking great we lock the clean sheet in i dont know i dont know about locking the clean sheet but certainly i was like at least i get more chances and like now i get trent feld right but no in the end he ended up with exactly one point he could have gone at 59 or he could have gone off at the end either way he ended up with a one pointer just a weird match from liverpool i it does feel like i was listening to like the totally football show like that and they were like the worry now is they were almost too good in the first three matches and it gave people a sense that they might be further along in the restarts or retooling whatever you want to call it with klo out and i think i its hard to say right because in some ways this team is fundamentally the same as last year right who is who would even be the kind like some players are more beted in but its even spas was there last year right i cant think of a single player in the starting lineup who was a new sign exactly so so i dont know its it the real issue for me and ive shared my screen here although while im on the transfers page for some reason i think i was just absent mindedly hitting buttons as i was talking to you i wild carded in all these liverpool players and and it just it just it didnt work out if i had just gotten the clean sheet i would have felt okay about it right but i did think trent had a pretty good game all things considered and he is in the zone clearly right now he had a great international break and there was a corner in which he went for goal he went for olympico and he was like well within his rights cu hes just so dialed in so as far as sh shelling out the money for trent you still have to feel pretty good about that i dont feel good about it because it didnt work out and i and i wild card out of a better team to so like sure i have these players now like maybe eventually theyll be good quickly run through the team for people listening no i think its fine i i have kaa stunk lost the clean sheet right away way trent got one point robinson lost it like what the 90th minute and 30 like 90 plus three like that it was like the like the last boot of the game lost his clean sheet henderson lo conceded two to lester awful performance it feels like lester are just gonna score one or two in every single match like i they might i honestly feel like unless they get a point penalty like a massive one i think theyre probably gonna end up staying up this year because theres just theyre just they just have enough like they can score goals i always this is just like my like my like rule of thumb which is that if you have a bunch of teams that are all near the bottom of the premier league table and like any one of those teams that theyre capable of scoring goals is going to be the team that stays up versus the the other ones well it aint southampton i can tell you that much no poor southampton its like they almost feel like an example of a team that got promoted like a year or two early its like they werent quite its like its sometimes it isnt good news to get its good news from like a bottom line standpoint but as a fan and honestly im not even from a bottom line standpoint you could argue that theres theres theres a case for waiting like trying to keep your powder dry like that right theres always the risk that you just dont ever get up right and that is the thats that so you always have to of course go go all out to get promoted but it does feel like there are times when its like you need to go to back down to the championship reset right like fulham we talked about this before but like fulham like it was like the third time was the charm with them right like and they seems like they have a lot of stability now its a real alchemy particularly when youre working with a lot of lone players and theres you have to have some level of continuity in addition to some elements of luck etc so i feel like when we looked at your wild card team when we did our patreon pod on thursday night i was struggling to find any issues with it i thought it looked strong in every position decent rotations no real weaknesses matt turner as your backup goalkeeper is the only guy whos probably not gonna get 90 in this in this lineup totally and i and i so i rolled out a 352 i got blanks from every one of my defenders my goalkeeper and every one of my midfielders an 0 for nine from those and one of my starting forwards didnt play jaa pedro and i lucked out because i definitely lucked out because johan wisa came on scored 24 seconds into the match got two bonus even though he subbed off in the 45th minute so so that feels like a stroke of good fortune and then of course i had holland and captain him so all told i wild carded and im down like 550000 spots so clearly a disaster but its like a house its like its like buy an old fixer upper i like the bones of this wild card its got good bones so i just need i just need it to turn into points eventually but its its a bummer im four weeks in now 15m overall and i think the worry now is this another season like last season where i feel like i like the team that ive put together and then every week it all goes right you just end up treading water exactly but its way too early to think that like i know i was talking earlier about being pessimistic i but i dont feel overly pessimistic i just rogers again its like another match rel looks good and but theres nothing happening with him its just its hes not i dont know its like if its if i dont know forgive me if im if im mentioning this again on the podcast but theres this tik tok feed i like where its all of these theyre all like french guys i think and they all take turns scoring like they all like its like they all do its like they all like its like a challen right and so itll be like a top bins and then itll be like two touch volley and if you get it you get a check mark if you dont get a whatever right and so these guys its like no one in the world is better at hitting the crossbar or the post than these guys right and its like theyre incredible at it occasionally they do go in but they are masters that accidentally like hitting the crossbar but getting so close and its like but its like theyre all just these dudes and its like kind almost feels like the difference between these tik to that guys as like the premier league guys like the premier league guys somehow know how to get it in and im just like its morgan like morgan rogers like if youre if you were capable of scoring you should have scored by now i dont know its like at some point like its its more than just bad luck right its like hes i dont know its like the gabriel jesus thing like do we is gabriel jesus on a 10year run of not being able to convert chances or is it just that hes not very good at scoring i dont know morgan rog is like to beat another metaphor to death feels a little bit more like when you first get the new fifa video game and your virtual pro is just has like no skills and you have to slowly build them up like morgan rogers like his aim was either directly at the goalkeeper or off to the side there was a great moment where he could have just teed up ali watkins for a tap in and the pass was just so off the mark so it had a one he he had a oneonone he couldnt convert weird match for watkins too he has the brace first goal he scored i thought was a good goal second one was i a bit lucky right it i think it takes a tough touch off the defender and loop straight into his path he almost cant he almost couldnt miss with the second goal and then but then he missed some like big chances and then d is it duran or duran duran duran comes on and and scores a great goal we a lot of great goals this whole weekend i was watching the highlights from the i had some play date related responsibilities st so i couldnt watch the the newcastle wolves game har barnes incredible but all three of the goals were great every single one of the goals scored in that match was fantastic because even the wolves goal was great because it had this great like a like dummy on the on the goal it was cool so so this is there was a question that we had for this weeks pod i think i had it down at the bottom but its jimmy ragd dog town asked what im enjoying about this fpl season so far and i would say again for me what i enjoy is watching the premier league and then fantasy is like the its like the thing that i sweat through in order to give its like i would say from a fantasy perspective i its more its like i dont know im not always having a great time from a fantasy perspective for me like watching the matches perspective i am almost always having fun like yesterday theres so much going on its very stimulating its fun and i and if i didnt have fantasy i would i just dont think id be was watching as much right its like i wouldnt be carving out the time for it and i but it does bring me a lot of joy watching these matches every day every weekend its a blast fpl is like somebody in a dark alley thats like hey buddy you like watching premier league well have you ever watched premier league like this exactly you ever smoke this and watch the watch the premier league exactly thats i think thats thats true from a from an actual fpl perspective this is a bad week for me to answer that question i think the thing i always love in fantasy like everybody i think is to have have players that nobody else owns who deliver and so i did have a little version of that i had johan vissa this week and ill take those seven points and and thatll be my little bit of joy this week for my own squad right is the visa bench boy so i will stop talking about my team now why dont you talk about yours because you its funny because i was thinking about this earlier today and how i was like im gonna say something to brandon its gonna sound insulting but i dont mean it this way or not completely at least but i think that you like this week was you showed the benefits of sitting on your hands right there are times when making no decision is the best decision right and i think thats something that you that you can first i was like did you get 70 points this week i was like d dang i ended on 55 points so you and i you and i talked on the main podt last week and you had triggered your wild card and i was like go with god thats not for me ive got my newcastle guys maybe ill get lucky with the north london derby then we talked on thursday and i was losing my nerve there was the international break injuries to odard to cl rice i was like what performance are we going to get out of arsenal this weekend conso had this little bit of a doubt even though he was past fit on friday and i just had this insane fomo not having a single liverpool guy so there was this inkling that i was as you said josh being passive so in fantasy you can be one of two things you can be patient or you can be passive and the difference is like patience is im trusting the plan that ive set forth and even though im going to be tested lets just carry it through and then theres paity where youre just not recognizing the situation that youre in you dont make the necessary changes and you get you get destroyed because of it and i was fearful that not getting any liverpool in particular was going to mean that i was managing passively so do you think its like an eye of the beholder thing one mans passive is another mans patience well its its a its a hindsight thing im able to say that it was patient because it worked out for me thats thats what leading from behind i think thats but now youve got now youve got two transfers and and you i think very likely i would say you ended up with a better squad by not making a wild card right like your wild card team would not have had 55 points would be my guess for sure no definitely not and like we had talked about i was thinking of going double liverpool defense so like i would have just been like destroyed when that when that clean sheet got wiped out so i do feel like im in a stronger position now i have to answer the question lingers of like well so what am i going to do with liverpool now i at least have the opportunity i doesnt look like the price market is going to be fluctuating too much this week while weve got these champions league fixtures that are starting and theres also the efl cup so guess im just looking for minutes rotation any injury concerns with liverpool with arsenal and all these guys whats up with saka y i cant believe they fl why whats the point of flagging saka anymore it will make a difference always being rolled off the that is a i dont want to get away from your team but ill just this a quick reminder that the european manch kickoff this week we have aston villa play on tuesday away to young boys at the wankdorf as we as we talked about last week wonderful and i think itll be very interesting to see whether watkins or duran starts that match i think i think we might see duran start it which would be good for watkins owners i think youd want him to start that match if watkins starts at midweek then i think we could see a duran start on the weekend and then liverpool also play on tuesday they go to ac milan so like you said well see what we see well see well see what we see but well i think i think the fact that its tuesday means that everyone should be fine i would love to see joda not start this match that would be ideal so well see there i was very i was leaning towards making the joda to to lis diaz move and was going back and forth but on friday and then i missed that diaz was set to price rise and its like i was like ah fine i was i was debating between the two anyways and the price rise i was like im not gonna spend the extra point one now when it was a lateral move i was okay with it so and then wednesday man city host lil and then thursday because theres no europa league or european conference league this week its all champions league its spread it over three days on thursday arsenal go to italy and they they visit at atlanta and so those are all again i have absolutely no idea how the scoring works this year in the champions league i dont know like theres even if theres if theres even a table like its not clear to me how many of this is going to work but but regardless theyre theyre playing and so i think this will be itll itll be a lot of fun just from like an individual game standpoint anyway so but brandon i want you to talk a little bit more about your team and while you do i am going to run and get a glass of water because i am a little part im going to give you im going to give you the free rain here for a second im going to vamp here all right go for it so the front line i felt like the edge that i might have is the newcastle away wolves say what you will about newcastles away form having the double up with gordon and esok felt good to me now there is a huge concern with esok hes now flagged in the game eddie how after the match said that esok mentioned he had blurry vision in the locker room at halftime and theyre not quite sure at least at the time of this pod whats going on with him and hopefully its not serious but its its very concerning and who knows what his fitness is going to be going into gw five so suddenly is esok to ali watkins is eso a make way to get cash to make it easier to get salah in and keep saka because right now the assumption with my team was always the only like the easiest way for me to get salah in is to get rid of saka and saka fitness prud is just in terrific form hes returned in every game we so far wed love to see a few more goals from him but i think theres no way i can drop him even though the man city fixture in gw five is worrying so josh this is this is i think a big piece of our looking ahead to gw five and potential transfers is can we just take the city arsenal match on the chin in recent memory its been nil very tetchy not highscoring i cant imagine holland has every chance of scoring in this match and arsenals performance in the north london derby was harrowing i thought i thought they worked their butts off yes and then they play on its i think theyre in a tough spot too playing away in italy on thursday maybe you talked about this while i was the schedule is brutal because then they play on sunday in the city match so artetas real challenge here is protecting some of his players who had to work hard in the north london derby cant imagine odard is fit for the city match because they had mentioned hes probably out for three weeks y at least theyll have delan rice back and watching the north london derby i thought if rice were on the pitch for arsenal that they would perhaps even have greater control maybe whats to discuss is whats going on with an ball and why has it just like not been working for the last six months i know and its its its just a weird thing with them because i continue to think they look good on the pitch and i cant tell if thats like if its just an aesthetic thing like i just enjoy watching this version of spurs play and yet youre right the results are not there right its like theyre theyre playing enoy enable brand of football i think but its just not like necessarily translated into a team that feels like theyre even remotely close to champion to challenging for a champion spot maybe when solani can level up i thought he had some moments in the in the derby where he he hasnt played in a few weeks right morgan rogers did up a little bit he did morgan rogers it a little bit thats true but my small moment of joy my whs a moment was emil smith row coming off of my bench with seven i had thought maybe benching j pedro in favor of smith row but thought i think its gonna be a tight between west ham and fulham it turned out to be the case but heck i will take it and as fantasy owners of jaia pedro youd love to see it not if youre a brighton fan but brighton couldnt they couldnt score goals hey we need jia pedro its j pedro team also classic premier league right the classic unannounced injury right just absolutely no obligation to ever i this is like my like my biggest bugaboo and i bring it up all the time but its just cra like why would anyone ever tell the truth why would a premier league manager ever like they could just go out there in a press conference on friday and be like osakas injured hes out for three weeks we celba wont play for us again theres no downside to that right like what is the what would be the like would you even get in trouble for that like you can say anything and theres no theres absolutely no obligation because no one tells the truth everyone hides all the all these injuries it happens again and again and so xiao pedro has a knock like no who knew not us so its a little tricky so what is your what is your plan right now then you have you have these two transfers so presumably youre not leaning towards a wild card at the moment because no no the plan the plan was prior to this game week that ill probably shift saka to salah and now i just feel like saka is immovable im just so enamored of his form and arsenal interesting so the plan is i think like the easiest move just based on like kneejerk is eso to watkins or the alternative would be i can do dogo jot to moala if i use my second free to move eso down to somebody whos 4 or im sorry 54 mil or cheaper is there anybody jamie vy okay thats interesting is you can get vardy for 54 he is 54 theres also ral himz who looks like hes won maybe its one match but i think against west ham he offered more than i think rodrigo mun has been offering at the start of the season so r gimenez is interesting but i bard is 56 by the way hes gone hes gone the wrong way hes as well he should he should have r it in price hes sublime song all of a sudden going the wrong way so can you can i see and well well say it out here because i dont again i dont want people listening to not know but im just curious what your squat no before you make any transfers im just curious what your team looks like whats your what does your bus team look like right now hit by a bus uhhuh my bus team looks like this im benching emil smith row who three flags so did you see this news about esok i was just talking about this while youre getting water but the blurry vision its worrying double vision its a was that song right like with my double vision at forer i think of im your huckleberry yes exactly kilmer and tombstone doc holliday so the plan the plan could be drop esok and get hins and then maybe roll another transfer the plan could be that double move i was mentioning where jot becomes salah and i downgrade eso but i think what i like i just im im liking having this flexibility up front with a m like a upper mid tier second forward that gives me like i wonder how youre feeling because you to go with the strong midfield you cant seamless easily get to a player like watkins that is true although its not its not impossible its two transfers so you have transfers and i and i would like to have him but im like okay with not having him just because of all the champions league stuff and the fact that he now has such a quality backup option what about another move so just looking at your squad i think your defense looks great right youve got kap poro and robinson back there henderson and go fine f whatever theyre all bad every keepers a bad except for except for ederson who gets us like he got his one assist a season so congrats to him for that sanchez for chelsea had a excellent game this weekend we dont need to talk about thats he did thats true credit to him he saved a pen and they kept a clean sheet although they shouldnt have kept a clean sheet i thought bournemouth were i thought unlucky in that one but they do they dominated for stretches for sure so good with the defense but then in the middle youve got you got rogers who at this point its just like whatever hes 5m like theres no point in getting too mad about a 5m player its the only joke is that we keep starting him in the face of these returns but like like you got smith row on the bench like i probably play smith r over i feel like thats pretty obvious im going to make that switch right now i agree your bus team had him on the bench last week so thats probably what it was i think in some ways the could you move gordon in down to a 45 fiveish player and then and then turn joda into into salah yes i believe i can do that i have 24 mil in the in the bank lets lets just try that for fun if i move jota to mo and i drop gordon how much do i have in the bank i have 46 so thats not bad its you could get a player who starts at least at 46 like not like just a straight up like someone who moved to saudi arabia and theyre just like theyre like red flag for the rest of the season this is the question different routes to salah is that what i need to do and well i feel like you cant let one that one performance against forest just put you off liverpool like we still have those first three matches in which they looked amazing as did salah just like if salah was able to complete a pass against forest he probably looking at some fantasy returns and i dont think were having this conversation so it does still feel urgent to me its a little bit like the holland thing like the non holland owners are now having to have like real talk of just like am i gonna persist with this strategy in the in the face of logic absolutely and i think the problem i was just thinking about your specific team part of the problem with those movies we just discussed is even if you made those you still have three flag players that would be starters right in ja pedro isach and saka now all three of them should start right but like youre like its like if you multiply 0 75 time 75 time its like youre started youre youre in a position where just somethings goingon to go wrong and its like do you want to like get rid of all of your cushion of bench players so i think i think its i dont know that and i can see why moving saka now maybe does make a little less sense because if you look at arsenals fixture run you can just survive gw five with saka right it turns into can you see this on my screen i can it turns into a a spectacular trio of fixtures right from game weeks 6 through eight where they host lester followed by southampton away to bour theyre almost too good where its like if it was someone besides saki youd worry about rotation but that artetta refuses to rotate saka so we should be fine with him and so like in my case my plan is to not make a transfer this week if i can avoid it right like barring some champions league injuries so that i can bring in saka myself starting in game week six and so in my case it would it would also be joda that i would be shipping out to fre cas for that its interesting whats going to happen in the midweek and the midweek is further complicated by the efl cup youve got everton southampton brenford fham palace man united brighton wolves and spurs all play in the efl cup midweek so have your antenna up for rotation injury etc and like youve youve pinpointed it with watkins is with duran and such good form how much of a transfer target is watkins if he starts and plays 90 in the champions league and i would be surprised if watkins doesnt start in the champions league because this is a dream moment for his career i think i think thats right its they its an interesting squad like are they part of me is like i think they probably are good enough like like are they deep enough to like because for a lot of squads that when you especially the champions league but even like the europa league for some teams right this happened to brighton a couple years ago where its like it can upend your season right because they just dont have the depth to rotate because theres just too many even when they try to rotate those can be matches that they then lose which means then you have to play everybody right and then suddenly youre playing your best 11 twice a week for on and off for three months right and thats when thats when your form comes to dip but i think they do have enough depth it just depends on the question is just how much is that even morgan rogers right like its not like theres no reason for us to think that hes so locked in that he couldnt get get rotated this coming weekend sure and its almost like him being left on for the full 90 against everton its like amry is like youre not part you could read youre part of the champions exactly lets lets lets hope i think all right so lets i wanted to because we had a proper game week where everything ended on sunday i wanted to quickly shout out the always cheating super league here brandon so give a quick shout out to fpl gw which is the site that i its a free its a free plug by the way to fpl gw but its a site that you and i love to use handy and and fun especially for real time like during match weeks and stuff sometimes i dont use it when im having an especially bad one i try to avoid it but but lets lets read off the top 10 we have a tie for 10th doug gorman and ruben hia are in 10th in ninth is allah sal hope i got that right in eighth is tor charlesworth again one of the reasons i love read out the i super league is you realize that we have a truly international audience the fact that i cannot pronounce half of the names in here is warms my heart in many ways because its its a it makes me feel like we have people from all over who listen to the podcast in seventh is liam buckley nice proper i dont know liam it could be irish or british right like its or or i dont know like congales we just

all right josh game week five its time to put the disaster that was game week four in the past yes exactly im surprised that im not feeling more im feeling fine about how gw four went like it was not a good one but i dont know doesnt the i feel like the first game we after wild card its like you look at your squad going into the game week you always feel good about it and it never quite works out right and so sometimes its like its it takes two weeks for a wild card to like settle in and so i think thats thats thats how im feeling about things and i think when it comes to gw five the big question i i would say arguably the biggest question right because its its the place where you can get double points right is what do you do with liverpool and you and specifically mosala versus erland holland right so erland holland is i think masking some deficiencies in this man city squad right now like we started to get into the top of the pot and i think we got distracted but i it does feel like he is so good that its like its hard to even tell how good man city are its like its very clear how good erland holland is right and like because i felt like brenford had like they could have scored three goals in the first half of the match they not they were not pushovers in that match for sure not all a couple of crazy moments and i think by the end of the match brenford ran out of gas and thats the thing with city is they just have a deep bench and can keep their foot on the gas for the entire 90 minutes absolutely this is what unlimited money buys you and i think thats fine and were not going to get into that on this issues exactly but i do think from a fantasy standpoint the fact that theres one player who is so good that the flaws of their man city are when i say flawed that only in the sense that like they havent dropped a point this season and maybe there maybe theres a youre comparing them to the heights that they hit the last decade exactly it does not feel like they are it feels like they are maybe slightly lucky to be on 12 out of 12 to start the season and so and i hope and i worry a little bit now that with odard with odard out and arsenal playing away in italy on thursday man city play a home match in the champions league the day before against what i was probably an easier opponent as well in lil versus way atlanta i think atlantas gonna give them a arsenal tough match id be surprised if arsenal won that game and so i think that its its gonna be a tough so theyre going to be coming coming off of that and i think its going to be a real od pill battle for them does that translate into lots of returns from earland holland well i dont know about that right like i think that we saw with arsenal today in the north lond derby right like arsenal they know how to limit chances they know how to limit chances their defense is incredible david rya he had another spectacular save in this one and its just incredible like some of the best saves i have seen from a keeper like that the i thought the saveing thea derby and the saving the villa match just like the best saves the season and so like even so its like even though i also think like you just organizationally theyre strong its a stable back line the left back spot has had a lot of different people in there but but in general its like theyre just so solid and then that like you said before they have duckin rice back and so do i think the man that score in this match yes do i think they score more than two goals no right but i think they probably do score two and then if they score two then well if they score two then hollands going to hes going to score one of those two goals right and then maybe both and and so it feels like again i like to talk about these like floor ceiling things when it comes to captaincy right so the ceiling for holland i think would be around 13 points right two goals and three bonus thats just im just guessing but like thats like a reasonable rule of thumb i think heuristic brandon is thats what thats the thats what im going to use for this and but i think his floor its a blank i dont know it feels hard to believe doesnt it lets say i cant i refuse to give him that low of a floor im gonna give him a goal and no bonus so his floor is six points i would say his range is six is six to 13 roughly and then if we go to liverpool bounceback game clearly i cant imagine the play is poorly field again salah had by far his worst match the season he was irrelevant in the match just a weird one from him i dont like he wasnt creating chances for other people it was just one of those weird matches it was like one of those matches from last season where he just like he wasnt involved and i dont like im im sure he had a couple of moments but i watched all 90 minutes of that game and i dont remember i just dont remember seeing him like theres always moments when theyre in the box and things like that but it just didnt feel like he like took control of that game if anything i thought diaz was the one he had that amazing moment on the touchline where it looked like the ball was going to go out and he won the ball like maybe he should have passed it but when they when they showed the replay you can see hes got clear space near post right there and he puts it right off the post i agree exactly inside post too it was like it was my thoughts on solah in that match were particularly toward the end it felt like he was just trying to do it for him and mo is playing for mo and i think thats what has traditionally made mo such a special player as hes just like im going to do my thing and its gonna be great but y to be conspiratorial or read try to read too much into this performance is this a pivotal moment for arie slot and does he do some weird stuff does at doesnt the attitude change at li pool cuz arie doesnt strike me im im going to call him arie i think thats fine he doesnt strike me as a guy who puts up with bs and he hes trying to exert his this is the impression i get from his press conferences and the postmatch interviews the impression i got another great song turned into a great try to knock on wood more singing on the always anyway so i think arie slots in an interesting position here and how he resp response and its like good for liverpool and for slot that they have the champions league fixed year to shake that rust off deal with whatever thats thats a very youre right and that its interesting like in arsenals case you maybe dont want this match on thursday but in liverpools place in liverpools case they probably do want a chance like they want a big match right away right you want to g of get the taste of that forest match off of you so i think that makes sense and i think theyre going to look a lot stronger on tuesday i think the big question and the reason why everyone should be holding their transfers as long as possible this week is theres liverpool have made a couple of depth moves over the last like the last month or so of the season like do we do we see some of these players come on like theres some theres some quality players in that side who have like barely played so far this season right like like kesa has kesa gotten on the i think dont think maybe i was trying to like remember if like got the premier league at least i dont hes hes still in zero minutes so he joined late into the into the window too but so kesa has barely played darwin has barely played gakpo has barely played and these are quality cody geko is arguably like well he was in the i would say in the in the first 11 of best players in euro 2024 right he was absolutely fantastic he plays in the louis diaz spot i think when hes at his best right as a classif as a forward in the game but i think he plays i think hes i dont know i think hes very strong in the left he likes to come from deep right and hes hes a dutch player right so he can like hes he could play anything from center back to executive forward but you could see him i think starting in place of diaz or possibly joda midweek for sure it probably deserves to honestly darwin im not as sure about like would you roll out a darwin a darwin gakpo double front line im assuming that salid will start just because just i cant imagine him not starting this one sol is just so fit thats not a concern i have he will play 90 forever for eternity darwin does seem like nobody respects him at that club for maybe some of his teammates to but i dont think slot showing him a whole lot of respect i dont think hes going to get a start no darwins in that category remember that those french ticktockers i was telling you about before hes the ultimate man this guy would kill on there like the way the crossbar would rattle when he was trying to score in this these challenges my goodness hed knock it right off the tumble over backwards i would i would love to see that so i think so what is salahs range of returns this weekend i think his floor would be like five points like it be think he gets some like an assist maybe and i think his ceiling is pretty high honestly i think i think a couple goals and an assist and bon it like i do think that like thats a possibility like just i just think hes got a higher ceiling than holland does right this weekend and so i think so if the if the floors are roughly the same and the ceiling is probably a little bit higher if you have both of them i think that would i would tip towards captain inala over holland i dont think i dont think the argument is that strong like its not open and shut in my opinion right like given hollands like form like just given the form that hes in you can make a case that you can just cap him every single week and never said those exact words earlier in the week too exactly and i and i dont mind that i just think because i have salah it feels it just feels silly to me not to not to captain him for what is so clearly an easier fixture and hes capable of returning as much as as much as much as if not more than holland and so this is an interesting question i think for a lot of listeners who dont have both you when you triggered your wild card was there ever a moment in which you thought you would not have both salah and holland no and i wouldnt have wildcarded if i didnt want salah right like the salo was the inspiration for the wild card right so the question then is as we look at the captaincy for gw five if there are managers out there who dont have both holla holland lets call the lets call it like a like a c if they dont have the double up with holland and salah is this a problem going into gw five no i dont think so i dont know i think that like its not like a its not like a minus four minus8 like level i think if you can like in your case you can get there but not quite easily enough to probably justify it right like given the way you just explained it to me before sure im weakening my team in another position to get salah so the math is am i strengthening my team enough just by getting salah in that its worth weakening my third my second striker position honestly if you could if you could do it with like if you could if you could have still afforded vardy then i might have been like in favor of it because didnt you say that you needed you had like 54 available it made me that i just mis remembered how much vardy cost im going to try to make these just like see if i can make these transfers right now im going to bring vy in for eso yep and then well see if i can afford salo vardy is right there just below nico jackson 56 and jota i have now 127 in the budget and mr salah how much does he cost its got to be less than that right 12 126 he cost 127 exactly i have exact money and salah so i think thats thats im interested in it 100 and vy lester host everton as well so the problem is youre you have exact money but i would be reluctant to use two transfers before all of the champions league and efl cup matches this week right sure i dont want to do that either agree it may be a gordon downgrade situation in that case right thats true but i do think that i think that i think we should be probably talking a little more about vardy as a as like a third as a as a as a third forward option i just think that he is i thought he was i honestly thought he was watched and and now im not so sure i dont know like hes its like it doesnt feel like he should be able to keep it up right like hes 36 like that and hes but he is clearly the its like its like hes its hes like in one last ride territory right its like this is this is it this is like the hes 37 hell turn 38 this coming january so hell be 38 before the seasons outred its amazing right and so like but hes 37 hes got two goals it feels like he could have even more right its like hes hes just hes exactly the same player he always was right like give him half a chance and hes probably going to score and its like god like imagine if i dont keep i dont need to keep negging these guys imagine if morgan roggers and darwin were just able to hang out shadow like a work training program if they could just shadow b for a week just like ring their with so much red bull and skittles exactly thats true it might only work for him its its like that its like its like someones got like a weird style at like in your office right and its like theyre disorganized and they deliver youre like well it works for him exactly i dont like it but it works for him all right so i think that are there any other captain option se captain options besides besides those two maybe maa i think that you how much i love jo mcneel gold and assist this weekend whats the deal people are now like sniffing around everton how does that performance while the mcneil performance was strong no shots at him but what everton are doing this season is just a disaster class and i dont i dont think i could justify going near them well no i think it would just be the i having just wild card i have to say i was not tempted to have i me they do have a nice run i i gu dway mcneil is probably fine its just the problem is like dway mcneil is like a pretty what im im i forgot i was sharing my screen here but just out of curiosity ill pull up dwight mcneel here hes a pretty known commodity right its not like hes been around for many years now and this is what his if we count this like one minute that he played in 2018 lets not count that well just say one two three four five six this is now his seventh year in the premier league right so i dont know that hes necessarily like leveled up in terms of what we should expect from him going forward i should reset what i said there about everton because fantasy is not always about the scoreboard its not about the end result youd be happy to have dc youd be happy to have dght mcneel after this game week even though everton continue to drive off of a cliff so its its a little more nuanced when it comes to fantasy exactly i think thats the more and less weirdly so all right lets get to a couple questions here brandon mar b says which preseason hypes can we debunk now that were 10 into this season got are we 10 into the season we are he says im looking at you guys barco well barco left so i think gordon what do we think is the gordon hype i think like if i were gordon owner as yourself included must be looking to hit the eject button there right its not been fun there was an interesting moment though when and shout out to our friend run in the youtube chat who mentioned that iso got a poke in the eye at the very end of the first half so that i have something to do with the injury but when esok came off at halftime anthony gordon was moved into the number nine slot he was playing forward and thats so the appeal is that if eso continues to not be able to see we might get we might get something out of out of i dont know i dont i its an interesting one gordon could go off like hes he has leveled up in the way that mcneel hasnt necessarily leveled up i do think when gordon got that move from everton to newcastle everyone was like okay but i dont understand this and hes risen to the occasion hes putting great tot for england so but the the fantasy returns have been garbage and that is very frustrating mean it does make me look at man utd as well that they were much hyped like coming into the season thinking ah theyre theyre making some interesting like smart signings for once and that del came in and look very feisty this weekend but still they cant theyre theyre struggling to score goals and be at that like top six level squad so i think like we can definitely debunk any like bruno garnacho cant even get a start i think the encouraging thing from a manett fan perspective is at least theyre like they are integrating a lot of players that are interesting and young and like i think as frustrating as its it must be for them right now like its i think theres a lot of i dont know like there its funny because i was talking earlier about how theres like i would say the manata fans are the ones who are who do embrace the pessimism like more than anybody else i think i think the first the first like 10 years post ferguson there was a lot of hope and then recently theyre like h like i dont know i dont know anymore i guesso is that like optimistic player for united right now and as a fantasy pick interesting there like theres just no one like more than morgan rogers is he well everybody is he has like m r has no returns so far in this season i think kobe minu i think is again not a player like im recommending but like hes because he hasnt he might be like a little too deep but like hes a hes a good player as well and like so i dont know like i dont know but anyway i dont think theres anything we dont need to name gu why did we start talking about man united exactly all right so es isan is quality like its just that i dont know like i him like i dont think hes overhyped or anything like that its like id be very surprised if by the end of the season you didnt have 20 goals right very close to it just not worked out for newcastle game week one got that ridiculous red card against baron diaz and that southton match ended up being like not a big fantasy affair and then isach comes off with this freak poke in the eye situation against wolves so its been we just havent gotten the right scenario for esi thus far amazing for sh to come out and what a season for him so i think that its i think i dont think like hes overhyped i just think like it hasnt worked out with him i certainly feel more confident in isach than i do in gordon lets see who else is in aars list gardial didnt even start this weekend probably like i dont know im not sure if that was a if that was like well its still hard to say because rodry didnt start either right and so i feel like we still dont know whats whats going on there i i was surprised to see lewis start over him and the left back spot but its just like the whole thing im just like i dont exactly i dont want any part of anyone that isnt that isnt holland on that squad unfortunately even ederson if ederson were 45m sure right but but hes never gonna be anywhere close to that jeep lets see who else munos well sadly muno so for him unfortunately could turn around of course but not looking great then the roll him and a score too so its like its even its a little scary there for him gayi i almost put him in the esok camp where its like gay is a good player and he has been a totally reasonable perfectly fine fourth defender in fantasy in the past right and thats where i would still put him like hes what is going on with the palace team and the palace defense i dont know why did they let their why did they let like a bunch of the best players go brandon like riddle me that and like why and a center back like right before the season started they were just so fun there was there its like that buccaneering aspect of them under glassner seems to have gone away weirdly will it come back i dont know its hard to say it we kept thinking it would with derby remember brighton and and never did so i dont know well see and then kaa i dont know what to say about that its i think ever asille is midfield is onana has had some stellar moments and hes a great player but i think theyve got a lot of work to still do in order to control of the games and i wasnt impressed with the midfield during that that match this weekend against everton this was this was the worry right is when douglas lise left that it was going to make them like a little less like rock solid to the middle theyve gotten away with it more or less so far they did lose at home to arsenal but but conceding two in the first half to ever they just seemed a little i dont know if incipit is the right word just like just like weak to put it in the simeone terms of like no coones from this side this weekend i dont know they did come back and win though so give credit where its due everybody its everybody spots everton two goals because they know that the next three are coming this make this fun for everybody the pattern for everyone this season all right so we talked about jimmys question about things youre enjoying fpl so far i like the way we ended up on that question though which is try to find one thing its like one fantasy thing each week one thing that brought you a little bit of joy john clovis says well okay here we go this is a another newcastle question this is where a lot of people are though right because l people went heavy on newcastle and the reason i added this though was because of his what he was asking at the end says i went heavy on newcastle with burn gordon esok but none have been that great i think thats true like weve had a couple of returns from from everybody but with a hard fixture coming up do i need to sell them all and suck up a minus eight so the reason i added this brand was because to me my feeling is if youre considered a minus eight this far into the season and you still have your wild card i would go ahead and just play the wild card i dont like especially because game week seven makes a lot of s or gameing six makes a lot of sense for wild cards already i would just do it a week early and i think its fine and i think theres i do think that like theres a very good chance that saka gets some return this weekend right he has every single game we so far this season and theres no reason for to think that he wouldnt right i me hes gonna play the full 90 most likely unless its a blood bath and i love that and so and if arsenal are gonna do something hes proba going to be at the center of it right so but with a triple newcastle i find just like getting rid of them like andy defra and sha shank redemption style like dropping little pebbles little grapp yard a little bit of time i think that makes sense just one guy in the yard bits here and there i think thats right i think i think i think im inclined to agree with that u so yes i think its i think that i think im with you there i would not drop them all and if you decided that you and also like the fullam match is not great but its not a horrible match like i think a pretty good chance they score like who do you think is a better start this weekend i think i know the answer but ill get anyway anthony robinson at home or william celba gabriel away to man city its robinson because hes just getting so far forward and being a part of the attack whereas we know what were getting with cba so does feel like celba is banging on for a twopointer this weekend feels like both are going to concede but totally theres something about a little bit more fun well it depends on your taste if you if you enjoy like imperious headers and a wellkept you high line or go with cba if you like marauding left backs go of robinson i brought in i i brought ip switchs greaves in on my wild card the only the only defender who got a return but of course he was third on my bench this week and so would you start i dont i dont think ill do this but it would be tempting to start him over both of those players and they because if swit play away to southampton and that match has some strong nilnil vibes to it doesnt it would i do it i dont know if i would but i will say it does sound fun to if youre not g to play greaves in this match and you dont have a player like gaves because youre ever going to play him right but four million fifth defender but its not bad if they were home if they were hosting southampton hed be an auto start i think this week the thing with southampton though like ramsdale doesnt have a reputation for being great in the air plus jack stevens got a dumb red card like the southampton defense is a bit weakened i wonder if greaves is a good shout for a setpiece goal against well and whats whats fun is they i dont know i dont know if everybody knows this but one thing they do in the premier league is its a its a full when they reverse the fixtures of the second half of the season every fixture in a game week is the fixture they play in the reverse fixture so i know brandon that there will be a week when arsenal and man city play where ip switch will be hosting southampton so i will have my chance to start greaves over my arsenal i love that youre committing right here on this episode of im going have just to just to just st true to my word here it all right well lets lets wrap things up with a couple final thoughts brandon how about this if you could only watch one match this weekend what match would that be spurs brenford feels like a fun one these are like you pulled that one out of a hat like thats a shocking answer i dont know like its its fun to bag on spurs and theyve got their issues but they have so many good players and when theyre playing well they can be fun and the same could be said of brenford now im curious about brenford because momo is also on my short list of players to get in the next few weeks and he like similar to anthony gordon was moving central after visa came off the halftime so what how does zomo fit into a visa liss brenford and then youve also got fabio carvalo whos not seen a ton of minutes and is a interesting attacking player for brenford and i so theres a lot of scouting to do in this match okay all right youve convinced me that theres theres theres theres something there i think the west ham chelsea match i think could be interesting just because west ham have theyre not its not like even a fantasy thing but im just interested in how this match shakes out its a little bit of a its its a its a its a south london derby in a way theyre theyre not that far from each other we u you and i saw west ham and chelsea when we were in london last time what chelse are west london by the letter of the law im sure theres a fair enough animosity there some energy people are like throwing things at the their phone right now as they as they hear that but but i think i think crystal palace main united could be a fun one that is the final match on saturday it is the 12 us 530 uk match i think that genuinely a difficult match to handicap i would say right i think a lot of results are on the table here like i that feels like the match that could absolutely like a neil nil does not feel on the table like it feels like a 32 one way or the other feels very possible in this one unfortunately for us dean henderson owners but i think maybe e does something i think interesting like the there was some drama about penalties with e and mateta but then was class trying to and mata was like this is my pen and and then they scored so its hard to argue with the result but but it was a little bit of drama there and so i dont know it feels like maybe i dont know i just i it feels like sa is one of those players whos due for like a big explosion and so maybe it in this match i think itll be a fun one though and you have man city host in arsenal on sunday but whats the fun in picking that as our one like thats the ob i feel like whenever we say one match to watch this weekend there is the completely obvious match and then theres the other like the fun other ones and the fun other ones are why you do fantasy at all right its like we were talking about earlier if you didnt play fantasy you would probably find a reason to say yes to that lunch plan with your spouse right but because of fantasy you can be like im sorry ive got to ive got to see whether whe sellur partk can be a fortress on on saturday my wife asked me the we were out having dinner this weekend and she was like so like you watch like you try to watch all the games im like i love it shes like you love it im like its like my favorite thing to do and she was she was like flabbergast and just like wow thats a thing that you just like love doing like 10 years doing this does she think you like that you just like the like the like tiny amount of like ad revenue that we get from its just part of totally mercenary this is a true labor of love this thats why you should be supporting the podcast on patreon by the way patreoncom always cheating to support this this quick sotic labor of love that is this podcast so all right i think i think we get in things there brandon if i had to we can do the ex dog at him to which player do i think has that dog in him this week okay ive got a good one leaf davis the leaf inator mr assist himself the leaf blower the leaf blower i think that he blows his way into some attacking return away to southampton i know i said this well lets just say return because i did say that nil was on the table there so i think i think the floor for lea davis is five points on on saturday im going with inku i think inuko i think he starts i think hes going to demand minutes just like that was such a well taken goal and the entry pass from sancha was great too so i like the looks of him against w its funny its like you can see maybe its its like a its like a soup de version of the u the forest thing we were talking about before its like you can see a version of this team thats good its just like whether they can the real question is whether they can shed the people who are its not working for right like the which they have done right like m seems like m played his last match played but like it started at least know i think mesas got the right attitude just in terms of just making hard decisions and being unafraid of being a jerk about it so i could see it happening for them this season all right do you have an ex dog and him for for game week five were going with were going with in cucko right im sorry you said that already y sorry about that i dont i dont want to go back on that pick be funny if you forgot you said that like i forgot you said it and you just came with a brand new one like on the spot

25,FMLFPL,ohZqMwGydVQ,Ep. 478 - On to GW5 - Tick Every Box,2024-09-17T07:20:47Z,"support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreon.com fmlf okay we're going to Von this Walsh how we doing much more somber watch this episode but we I SM moving along oh I'm always smiling it's just it's SM I either smile cuz it's smile or I'm smile to hold back the tears you know uh this is one of those but uh I was thinking about our you know both of us on fat Reds and I was just like this is really the week we're getting tested like this is can we hold our nerve can we keep our good players you know like yada y yada or are you I mean you got yeah I'm on 200k I didn't really expect it to be honest but I think it's just like my scattered onep pointers isach off at half Nico didn't start and hendo just the actual worst pick in the [ __ ] game worst player in the league I would have thought for you at 51 would have sort of just treaded water because of how yeah poor everyone else did besides Captain Holland but I guess you know I thought so uh yeah everyone's also still at this early stage so bunched up point total wise that every few points is actually like a huge amount of I bet you I'm like 10 points away from like 150k or something crazy like that well how many 10 points is a lot 40 no I'm I know your week was bad I mean your overall points oh um 300 301 I know so 301 yeah so you're 11 or 12 higher than me and you're probably what 300,000 places I'm 180k you're 35,000 places ahead of me 10 points is a huge amount of points yeah yeah yeah so yeah 51 bad job by me after mentioned Dean hendo I mean this guy yeah 2141 palace defense complete mess disaster every game yep yep yep yep onep pointer por0 2 Nico doesn't start I had I basically had 10 men Ian how Nico played 10 minutes so that that's the equivalent of 10 men for me every Point counted this week I mean you had 10 men but I mean I had like [ __ ] yeah the one pointers you know got the pen didn't take it did he get the pen didn't get that um yeah Gordon blank mo the eso situation I was [ __ ] running a sausage fest in the park no one's going to know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about but I was running orders I checked my phone Walsh just like ESO subed at half like what the [ __ ] Vision blurred he's probably [ __ ] concuss I don't even know the bloody nose doesn't make your vision blurry but yeah it was bad but you know the real worry for me now is I transferred in J Pedro he's knocked herzler is a fraud we're not going to know anything unless he plays in The Cup game eso's heard Eddie's a fraud we're not going to know anything barco's not in the [ __ ] premier league and sunar is hurt and I'm sitting here have two Frees I was planning on completely chilling until my wild card in six now it's like I haven't popped anything I haven't touched a thing um can never never tell with you yeah yeah no yeah and sometimes you sometimes you throw it on me on the Pod like it's happened before that's true it's happened happen before I'm trying to find pod boys where's the Pod boys leag yeah we need to spend some time looking at your uh your team that'll be more a Thursday thing I guess but yeah well I mean it can't be a Thursday thing if you're wild carding you got to do it that's got to be a now thing yeah it's true I mean I already missed two rounds of price changes but who [ __ ] cares I certainly don't unless if you're really avoiding drops like which I don't know maybe you did have a drop but double price like that's not a thing anymore like double triple price risers like that just doesn't happen they they they diddle it too hard and they they have their finger on the scale too hard I mean it's it's still like you can't possibly lead you can't point to anything other than salani to indicate how [ __ ] fraudulent this game is right what he he went down once or not even he has not price changed he got he's had like 2 million sales and he hasn't price changed they just mispriced him because or they mispriced him conceivably if he was on Spurs so they're just like we're just not going to price change we're not going to change his price gaming two that's what it is 855,000 transfers out Gaming 3 800,000 transfers out G MC four 350,000 transfers out no price change no price change so I mean that's why they don't tell us the formula cuz there isn't one and they just do whatever they want and they make a mistake accurate yeah yeah um so team walshire not good not a good week not good another week without Holland tough I mean yeah I it it was nothing if not a mistake to take Holland out of my team I think we 100% know yet until this game and next game where they're the only two weeks of the Season where he maybe won't be the number one cat I mean that's a zero percenter because he's already on yeah I mean he has more goals than any team in the league the last two weeks he's on 60 points cuz it's double cap on both weeks and it's so it's I got away Max absolute [ __ ] Max Max punish I mean I got away with it last week because I happened to get points elsewhere and mo you know equal him but uh didn't happen this week not by a long shot I mean Mo was invisible washed version of himself he was and everyone was terrible I mean the only returns I got were olly and and Rya everyone else was a a one a triple onep pointer in defense with Trent Lewis and Robo and then I had just blanks everywhere else it was just unbelievable Carnage and and yet you're still 180k yeah I mean it's just the thing where it feels so bad is that I obviously used all my chips and then and I you know talked a few moments ago that everyone's really bunched up but it just feels so bad to like give it all back right away almost like this week you know that's what it feels like you that's why I said kind of at the beginning like you know this is the week that's going to test us sort of the next two weeks like I have your team is still [ __ ] good Holland is not the best cap and we'll see how it goes you know but but that that's where it is for me is like this week the best can hope for is going back to where I was last week so like that's how I'm my sights are angled as like the the best case scenar and and that's just bad like that's a bad job so yeah I mean you had an 8 million gaming crank it's not high not high not high but yeah I think overall things are mostly fine um yeah I mean the right right did [ __ ] right I think I'm going to have to defer the league updates cuz didn't do them [ __ ] it all right dude game week five onto game week five but what are we talking about from last week um where do you want I want to start I think e is the biggest talking point oh god dude that how [ __ ] disgusting was that it was really I was so El gut Punch Yeah I was just so elated for me like 75 seconds between the pen and then watching bald huge tuck in shirt yeah I transferred in Pedro and E and I'm like ah Pedro doesn't [ __ ] not even in the squad hurz fraud blah blah blah as a saves the day here it comes Max bones easy [ __ ] me [ __ ] [ __ ] us um so Mish said do we hold as an hope um Heim said is Mata stri does he make it into the three best forwards on the wild card over Watkins or Kai um JB is Muno is an immediate cell he's wild carding six but still maybe immediate cell and fering said our Palace now just a large Garbage barge that should be fire sold well there are mean these are all obviously Palace question but where where do you stand with as I mean we didn't know obviously ahead of the game but glasner said you know we have Mata and as two pen takers and then he lets them sorted on the field I mean where do you stand more annoying that he said that way more annoying I agree gives us more one they'll take turns the trepidation of Saka odard handing each other pens because they're friends or something like that situation but I mean it's hard to it's hard to sort of like rank how much of a downgrade it is if you know what I mean like all I know is it's a big [ __ ] downgrade cuz he just got from Saturday till now he just got minus five goals on the season you just subtract five random 10-point hauls from the season and that's really [ __ ] bad that makes him from a great Auto pick to he's an okay pick um the fixtures aren't good home man united away Everton might be really good but who knows when bran is coming back home Liverpool at Forest Home Spurs I it's just not good you this is not a player that you would bring in for this fixture run if you knew ahead of time he wasn't on Pence and now we have him and we're just like [ __ ] I I'm not even sure this is a good pick so that's kind of where I'm at yeah I mean he's never going to be a bad pick because he's still a good player but he's a bad pick yeah I mean he's just not best pick like in what Universe would you buy him from this point forward there isn't one I think it would have to be a real really good fixture on that's what I was kind of trying to say I mean maybe 10 through 14 at wolves home Fulham at Villa home Newcastle at ips switch or something or you know 18 through 25 whatever point stands you would never buy him for the run that he's currently on and yet here we are with him it's it feels [ __ ] horrible dude it's terrible I wait it feels like I just lit a free transfer well two free transfers on absolute fire [ __ ] also [ __ ] that I mean he had the goal gami one rolled out cuz of the ref thing Y and then this one like I mean you you're looking at you know he could be on 40 30 to whatever 30 something points you know top four mid in the game he could be it could be mo diad Saka as yeah right now easily and it's like these are just he's just a beta and that's what we're seeing before our eyes I know put fo down yeah yeah I mean that's literally what's going on here so I don't want him um I feel like I'm going to get rid of him as soon as I possibly can I'm going to keep him this week because I'm I'm saving for sure but yeah I mean he still has Avenues he's still yeah he's still classy he still shoots a lot I mean yeah but this is just the power of pens where it's like you know we have a really bizarre layout of our fixtures where we actually don't have a good fixture window at any point this season which happens to some teams sometimes like there isn't think the run I laid out is good enough I don't yeah I don't I don't agree cuz I mean you're looking at some tough ways and you know f are always a tough game if switches it but I mean then you're looking a five I don't think fulham's good I think Villa's pretty poor I mean Newcastle we don't know what they're going to look like in November regardless you know I mean a team like us like a good fix run I mean you're looking at you want in a six game five or six game week window like multiple home games with home in way of the promoted sides and like we just don't have that you know maybe things will change but just looking at it now and when you don't have that the pens are the things that buoy him to be feeling like in your head as like an elevated pick where okay well there's a bad one there's a good one there's a medium one there's a good one there's a medium one doesn't matter you know we went a pen NE all neckti was doing the whole game was diving like we're going to win probably seven pens this year between e and him and like you know that's what we're going to do yeah yeah and yeah maybe two yeah maybe he'll take two so you're subtracting 40 points from his total so he's going from knocking on 190 to being like 150 and that's just not a pick yeah I think a lot of people listening to this probably are thinking like oh we're overreacting he's still good P but here's another way to put it imagine a world where bumo is not on pens what are we talking about no one's transferring him in yeah I he's on the 15th best team at best in the league and they're they barely score and all they do is [ __ ] set piece and throw in play like I'm good easy pass on bumo and yet I'm sitting here it's ging five they're at Spurs and I'm like I can't believe I don't have buma on my team like I'm a [ __ ] idiot for not having boomo on my team especially with the way the bonus points are this year it seems like if you score a goal you're at least get an A bonus point if not all of them so yeah as you know it's just it's just unfortunate very unfortunate yeah I I have a note a little note in my phone going this week and after that moment I had to start it in my this is how I get my frustration out I was like who actually takes every box because e just got removed from that list and the list is very [ __ ] short yeah players it's bumo it's Bruno Palmer I don't I don't think Bruno's on the list honestly his open Play threat is too low for me decreased yeah so Saka bumo Palmer and then the one cheap guy that no one talks about except for me and pre mgw no yes no no every box is ticked he's also like just he doesn't shoot he shoots sometimes he shoots enough maybe once a game no he shoot he shoots more than that I mean but I'm not with you on mg I mean I feel like we've reversed roles with mgw where yeah I had him on wolves before they transferred him to like the flamp and he was like removing I mean I'm good at that I do that every year you've done that multiple times but he he plays deep he doesn't shoot he's not on set pieces anymore he's actually not on set pieces anymore so he's you're right you're right we don't also we don't know he depends like you could show me wood taking the next like this could Bea they only won one pen they only won one pen last year because they're wolves and he took it but wood wasn't on the pitch okay I'm moving him so it's sakaba Palmer that's it from the midfielders from anyone any forward midfielder Defender everyone in the game those are the only players who take every box I think it's a little bit unfair to compare that I think like the set piece situation just because Strikers don't take take set pieces like I think they have to be sort of removed in that okay but it's a it's a box for me though that that's why you know midfielders are better and score more points I mean that's son he's almost definitely on pens I don't think he takes Corners doing mat's doing it and some idiot yeah I mean you could argue for that but also we're not 100% trees on pens also yeah that's true it could be Dom right you're saying could be Dom it I mean he's a the season okay so he's off Corners which is probably good to conserve his energy cuz yeah um there was a time when he was I remember he was like taking a lot of corners and he was he getting some cheeky assist yeah he took 150 Corners in 21 season but yeah I mean I think it's those three guys are the only ones who tick every box and that that means like open Play goal threat open Play assist threat set pieces pens Corners yeah yeah Mo's not on on set pieces yeah IND indirect right yeah it's just that Avenues I was talking about the Avenues last pod right or maybe that was the Thursday half the corners but it's Corners is pretty good yeah about like Trent right like you don't consider clean sheets an Avenue but he would be on zero points if clean clean sheets weren't an Avenue right and he got three clean even though everyone missed his chances so it's just it's just something I was looking at yeah removed as he off yeah he's off off yeah it's such a nightmare maybe it should just be not you have to be on corners or you have to be on set pieces but combined like you take enough dead balls yeah that it's like a you know it should be like a number I can easily make this like a chart or something where it's like you have to pass pass these thresholds yeah well I guess it's also like ranking the value of the set pieces I mean direct fre direct free kicks are the most valuable indirect set pieces from like elbow range and then Corners last so those are probably similar like you know the corner crosses to uh sorry Corner cross to like an elbow cross I'm sure they're like not that different um yeah but what yeah it's just something interesting yeah so definitely but what about Mata I mean is he now just like a really I mean this equally makes him a much better pick because he just added five goals right so that's alarming in a good way right I mean he's a pick he's a pick yeah for sure um I mean he was already flirting with pick status and now look I mean we've had a really tumultuous couple months here and now that we have the squad that we have I feel like glar is going to be able to kind of you know get and we have lowkey had a lot of changes like a lot of changes last year so many changes I mean it's in the engine room it's at Center back it's you know it's at Wing it's like almost every area of the team has been bad job that it all happened in the last [ __ ] week of the window except Alis like it just I mean it's this team does not know each other yeah it happened it's done with and now here we are today so I do think that we will continue to improve if the season progresses and uh yeah mateta 75 just good you know I mean NE TI is good we have good players we're going to keep playing better and I think that you know we're going to be in good shape in about a month or so also I just I don't know what the hell gay he's up to but watching those highlights and he's been sniffing glue or something I think he's huffing nitrous before every game as a warm-up and it's like he just looks like he's 45 years old can't turn can't run all his touches are bad I'm like what is this this guy is so good and now he's bad I don't know what's happening yeah he looks like he needs a few weeks off honestly yeah which I mean I also no it's not coming I mean I also think that there's a lot more responsibility on his shoulders with Anderson gone like I think Anderson was more more like AR like kind of like van D like telling everyone where the [ __ ] they're supposed to be and now now I think that's falling gay like set the line and you know do all that [ __ ] and he's playing with fuing Seltzer on his and kle on his right and it's like what the [ __ ] is this I mean if you have to compensate for playing with kleene I mean anyone's going to look bad playing next to Klein behind pressure yeah I mean yeah so we've got I mean and like Munoz right mentioning earlier yeah it's the defense is is just not there at all so you you just shouldn't yeah you shouldn't have The Defenders you know lroy just came in and it's it's going to take some time yeah yeah y okay yeah um yeah speaking of Palmer actually because we we did get two Palmer questions and Mishka said deep analysis of the Chelsea game what did you learn should expectations for what should expectations for Palmer be and then he lists all his stats which were bad and then Elon said any concerns about Palmer I'm thinking of using him as a cash cow next week so I mean what is he a couple weeks removed from a 50p pointer and um you know he had a 17p pointer six pointer one blank and now everyone's selling what's happening I mean it's it's an overreaction but I think there are some mning signs that are worth taking note um you know they he's just sort of peripheral in in a lot of a lot of as was in that game yeah and you know it's Wolves I think are you know we'll come on to wolves when we talk about wolves later but outside of that like it seems like the enemy is just okay let's mark him and take him out of the game and then we'll deal with the rest and he's not really getting into threatening position so much and you know he's doing a lot of his work you know around the edges and in in peripheral areas of the pitch yeah and you know it's he has a lot of avenues as you you know mentioned previously with the pens and the all the other all the other bits there but you know he's expensive and when they make three attacking Subs every game and it's three strangers for three strangers and they play on you know Thursday all year it's like what does this team jelling look like and when it does gel you know who's taking the shots it's it's probably not going to be Palmer that much you know I mean it's almost to me I feel like he's kind of going to turn into like oil where he's like look last year he got 10 penalty goals and he did score a lot of really beautiful goals and I'm I'm probably going a little too hyperbolic in terms of like decreasing Palmer's goal output or potential but I mean last year he scored 22 that will be his career high I feel like I would bet any amount of money that he will never score more than 22 League goals in his career no one gets 10 pens a game like it happens one time ever yeah and his shot his just his shot out output's not there to to level you know what you need an open Play period so you know what where do his points come from I mean the assists are nice but the change of the bonus system really deflates the value of those you know there aren't 6 point assist goal scorers getting six point assists aren't a thing anymore so you know where does he land you know probably still hit somewhere in the 180 200 range but is he just like a hold forever you know I'm not sure you know I know last week we're looking at it and saying you know okay he's just underpriced still and he still might be but I'm just trying to look at it a little bit more like how does it go wrong and I can see how that's it like that's kind of where I where what what I was watching on on the Bournemouth game right for for me the biggest takeaway from that game wasn't necessarily like uh oh Palmer might be a bad pick it's Bournemouth is just not a great fixture yeah B they [ __ ] everything up they press you to death they [ __ ] up your buildup they win a lot of their battles yeah aial monsters they win their battles they're really physical they I mean they just kick the [ __ ] out of Palmer that's what they did you want to progress the bot of Palmer we're going to foul him every single time and or two men in front of him and he can't like he just couldn't get the ball from that like right space to the center and he couldn't find Space couldn't find any space ever um and like you said we'll get to them later I mean I think that like you know the cap this week maybe that's where we should go next yeah but and we've seen a bunch of Bournemouth games now and they have not had good fixtures right I mean like Everton's good but like now we think more highly of nfo home newcastle's not easy to completely shut them down and they completely battered the [ __ ] out of the better they they were better than them by a l they were better than Chelsea too they miss a pen lose one nil but they were just better yeah um yeah so that that was my bigger takeaway I mean I was looking at like some of their stats and stuff I mean their third lowest buildup percentage against um first by a very large margin in league in you know High turnover they missed the pen that's what I'm saying yeah so you know there's going to be teams that are like the top top best buildup teams in the league like we would think of like desery Brighton obviously he's not there anymore City Arsenal don't know if Liverpool are you know like big TBD they haven't really played like a great pressing team at all yet um so we'll see if they can bust through but yeah I'm with you right now I mean if I had Oly I would be captaining Oly yeah but I mean circling back I'm with I'm agree with you completely on the bouth standpoint um you know we have to we have to update our how we look at them completely and comprehensively I think but you know going back to the polymer situation it's you he's again with the a he's never going to be a bad pick like he's he's going to get returns he's going to get points he's too good but I definitely think that you know if you need money you can look there like I don't think that's egregious and he's not in he's not in that many teams and like do I want polymer in medium fixtures when I could have Saka in good fixtures no not close do I want to have Saka and bad fixtures when Palmer has good fixtures no I probably want to go back to Palmer like Yeah The Way That season has shaped so far is like there's one mustone and his name's Holland and then like between Mo Saka Palmer maybe even Sun we'll see we're going to rotate like it's hard to say now it's only been five game four games but it seems like we're going to rotate these guys based on fixtures which seems right to me right now but yeah I mean I wouldn't be worried with him like you said never a bad pick has all the Avenues one of three players who ticks every box he's gonna get pen they're not gonna get no pens you know um and the one nice thing too with him compared to the other premium assets is he's not even in the Europe Squad so yeah you know while they play it's going yeah it's going to affect their preparation and the cohesiveness and the rhythm of the squad because he plays you know [ __ ] four new player every game is ridiculous but um I mean this International break players injured that's fine but it just it does feel that way that it will be disjointed you know throughout the season but for Palmer you know he's going to play 90 every game in the league so you know that's also a huge Boon to his value which we can't say about even Mo you know I mean we can't say that about everyone yeah none of the pre premiums well I assume Spurs are not in Europe right they're in something aren't they are they I don't even know man let me are they in um conference League or whatever I think so um oh Europa League Europa League All right so they they have Thursday carag yeah so even son I mean I don't know maybe he'll rest them but yeah yeah um well we kind of teased the captaincy I me we haven't individually talked about Liverpool or Villa yet but we could start with cap and then go to either one of them but I mean big daddy said toala still the best Captain this week or we've seen enough against Forest to second guess aie is there anyone you like for captain at all if you don't have Mo and then benett Jitterbug also discussing Mo versus oyap all the same [ __ ] I mean yeah it's hard to answer this before the midweeks because like what would you need to see well like what would change your mind do you think because for me I I don't think the midweeks matter that much play Mo doesn't play Allie plays doesn't so worst case is like Ali starts Mo doesn't start mm then what OE yeah I mean it's like they both play on Tuesday like they both have like ample time off before the game like I I just don't think it matters I mean obviously Ali this maybe is going to be a recurring thing with him his slow starts I mean he missed every chance imaginable in the first three games then he blows up with 13p pointer maybe he's going to be good for the rest of the season like he was last season but we know his Fitness is like you know once he's fit he's a [ __ ] beast like I've never seen him not sprinting um so I'm not that worried about that I wonder what actually was bothering him there was an Emory thing that said like he came back with like a little niggle or something yeah but what kind of niggle would one have that they would still start and play an hour like what is that it's so confusing could be anything it could be his [ __ ] should like I you know it could literally be anything just little pain here like whatever yeah I mean it's yeah I guess it would be I guess it doesn't matter than midweek yeah I mean it's to me it is definitely oi because Bournemouth are legitimately a good team and wolves are a joke like I think wolves are second to um sorry Southampton to best attacking fixture in the league based on how they're playing this year um that's just how I see it you know that's how how I've seen them play all season and they don't have the Personnel to really do anything different like they can't park a bus they have such [ __ ] bad Defenders and they have no Midfield like I mean Mario lamina I don't even know if he's a defensive Midfield I don't know what he is but I mean they they just don't have any kind of like no I love him but I'm just saying you know they don't have like DMS to play like he seems like he's just doing this thing and he's you know going to be doing it all year no matter what and they they're just so open you know they're just so open am I crazy or like were they not playing three at the back for like large majority of last season and you know just got three [ __ ] dudes in there who headed [ __ ] out yeah they they played like at least by FB ref which isn't perfect I mean they basically from November on played three at the back in every game yeah I mean that's when they were playing three at the with like eight nor was playing Wing like those games and yeah but this year they're just playing for the back just expensive that's going to be good neither of them can do anything they're [ __ ] bad tomato and anori defensively are not good well Tomato's pretty good defensively I think but I guess fast um yeah but no I mean that that's what I'm saying it's just they're just playing this open there's so much space on the pitch every game I've seen them play this year and you know it's their yeah I me I think this is like they're very exploitable I think it's a lot the gambling people were on them as like they're the team that could get dragged into a relegation race yeah like there were good odds on them or something yeah like they compared to the odds because everyone just basically has all the promoted sides straight back down um I wish they had saw in that I will say that but saw yeah yeah potenti for sure yeah and Johnson kind of stole some points from me as a you know ESO Gordon owner I mean there was like a ESO played Murphy and clean through Johnson save there were a couple other like could got something there yeah yeah so he'll do that but but yeah I I'm born with are just good you know I mean Mo I I think I think the fixture is not close enough which is also really aggravating because I don't I mean if I didn't go the main reason why I wanted to get Mo on [ __ ] wild card was for this week and I'm like ah just whatever yeah it's fine yeah that's F yeah I mean that's what that's why I kind of have those stats like ready to go for Bournemouth because you know I watched the match and then like today I watch highlights of all the matches and whatever and I was just like dude what and then I was trying to just like put numbers to it I was like what are they like doing like why is this working you know highlights will never show you any of this [ __ ] but yeah I mean they just they just break everything up they just [ __ ] are a pest um and Ariel good yeah I mean they also just have so many high energy like chrisy like all of their [ __ ] guys just run an insane amount Taver seeno I mean they all fullback also never go forward they [ __ ] challenge you and stick to you and valou you um and then they just go long that's the other thing when they attack they're not [ __ ] Southampton there's no opportunity to like win the ball and get a chance they just [ __ ] go long to their huge guys to S meno he win every du it's just like go [ __ ] deal with him [ __ ] off it's nowhere near our goal ever the one other I you know we we also didn't kind of know I mean Sancho looked unbelievable you know there there could be something there could there could be something there I mean look Netto good player really doesn't fit what they do at all I so I I don't know what how that's going to end it's not going to go well for him is how I'm imagining plan of this team everyone knows is [ __ ] ridiculous there is no plan buto might just be banished already like I would not be surprised Enzo said like he doesn't care about the other guys he likes keeping a small team like it might just be yeah or he just plays on Thursday or something yeah yeah I just mean like from Prem yeah but I mean Sancho is interesting especially from a Palmer standpoint where he just never wants to shoot all he wants to do is facilitate so I like that you know I like that he could potentially take a step forward and get in the team well s kind of is the same which is weird and funny right it's just like you get saner the ball let him dribble a little bit he'll create he he also doesn't really CU you're saying that's what Palmer's like sort of too yeah yeah I feel like Palmer likes to shoot though he shoots he likes to shoot but maybe he's insted not to yeah yeah um yeah Sancho yeah keep an eye on him Manchester United could really use him yeah they could they should buy someone like that that'd be good um oh yeah so yeah olly more questions about olly and just other forwards I kind of just group these all together um yeah people with c and isach do we kneejerk to Mata and Oly or play it cool Bolter said in previous Seasons I would punt on Oli transfer sock out even though I'm wild carding in six which is something we we kind of talked about on the last SP of just like the interesting decision that we have now with the five transfers and rolling the freeze um yeah I I guess we can just start there the other ones are about other forwards um yeah where do you see that like using a free free let's just say use Bol as example use a free ES to Ali even though I'm wild carding and get in6 so you're like basically burning a free for one punt one weak punt but you're going to wild card and have one or two or three free um well it's not a onewe punt it's a two- we punt because you're captaining him so you get double so I think I like that thinking I like that thinking I would definitely do that definitely cap Bali bring him in for sure um any other thing you tell me I would not say sign off on that one we move but what I mean this is like kind of touching on both of our team I mean where are you at with ESO and also not having Ali like how do you see this cookie crumbling or I mean it just feels really ridiculously stupid to not have Olli right now is it just for this week cuz it's Wolves and the Holland thing or is it just like for the next I mean it's Wolves IP switch really um it's like the next two and that was kind of I had like a plan at some point that like I'm gonna get Oli but I kind of got scared off it because he played 60 Minutes every game and was missing every chance you know he finally came good so good for everyone who has but yeah I mean if isach wasn't Hur let let's just say Newcastle still win that game isach probably gets a return if he's on the pitch I would probably just suck it up and just be like ah just going to stick with it hold my free like it's sets me up better long term but with ESO hurt probably can cuss I mean I'm no [ __ ] doctor but again the vision blurry thing is a little concerning um yeah I mean it seems worth it does it matter to how many freeze the person's on because I do think that's a factor you have three or one or whatever yeah because if you have one and you make this one move move and you wild card then you're just going to have one after wild card and you better have done a lot of your picks right cuz if not like that's a little you know you're in the normal season kind of like scary I think in terms of doing the move it doesn't matter cuz I think having oi Captain compared to Mo or anybody else is enough of a edge I think where it comes around is you know how aggressively can you plan your transfers with your wild card if you have one versus three or four right because like we're going into this you know the bad City and Arsenal so you know how many of them do you have to stash like probably more so you might have to go a little thin on the edges on your wild card and you know or oh wait no cuz if you're doing it now you don't have it for this week right no it's for this week oh G in six we have wild card [ __ ] up yeah so yeah I don't think it matter I'm mixed up I'm thinking if you're doing it now oh you're good yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't think it matters I think because when you do it in six you're getting the Arsenal players you're doing the things like it's easier to make a six team than it is to make a five team but the only part that makes it weird and it's hard to talk about specific teams because everyone's in a different situation but like with Andy on our live stream right it it came down to like actually dude you should just rip wild card on the last day of an intern naal break to save your transfers which is kind of where I am and the fact that I might have to Wild Card is like if I don't get any ja Pedro update no ESO update they're both fraudulent managers who aren't going to say anything anyway but I'm sitting here with a team with like two maybe not players Nico who might not start barco's not the league soar I could use my two freeze right I could like double change get Alli cap oy whatever but then I'm on no freeze versus I could just wildc card have two frees afterwards and I'm in probably a better better spot yep so I don't know I don't know what people should do you know with that information it's like maybe if you can just use one you do it but if it's more Wild Card early yeah it's I mean the the the contextual nature matters here but I think some of the same processing of you know how should I be looking at this applies um yeah it's it's tough it's tough call it's an interesting call I mean when we're you know we keep talking about this how much more fun the game is with this rule change just adds so much more complexity and so much more you know thought behind you know it's not just oh dead end cuz you lose it or whatever it just makes the game a lot more interesting yeah um yeah because this would be in a previous season this would not even be a decision of course use your free before your wild card yeah you have to or you burn it free yeah you just do it it's like almost a M you know you're automaton kind of yeah so what about DCL great p i mean ever since we declared the error he's come back with the Vengeance with his bullet 12 last two all I was saying on LR pot is DC's a pick mcneel's a pick look at that [ __ ] Hall I can't believe they went up two again and blew it again though can't you absolute [ __ ] house team but I think they're picks they're still picks McNeil's 5'4 D's 5'9 hard to find guys in that price range who are better I mean look we talk about D Celia pens and I mean you know why why is mcneel a pick just run this through again for me because he's never been a pick since he's been in the league which has been for seven years yeah I think it's just more a really long run of good pictures and mcneel is this rare weird who I mean there's probably others in the league maybe like Kevin falls into this category but probably not because of like doku and B and whatever but if there's a chance he's assisting it he creates literally every [ __ ] chance imaginable for their team and there's there's just not it's sort of like the Talisman [ __ ] but for assists because all their chances are like get the ball to mcneel cross set piece mcneel cross free kick mcne cross and he sometimes shoots and scores World e and whatever but like it's just are they going to score goals are Everton going to be fine I still think they're GNA be completely fine once they get guys fit so do I dice just too good and like so yeah I still they're going to score goal they just scored two against Villa they're going to score goals in this run of easy fixtures and he's gonna rack on the assist in this stretch that's it and he's 5-4 you know it's it's just free real estate you know sisers Bournemouth who we just aformentioned best team in the league Bournemouth we just talked about and then he [ __ ] Halls as for Villa easy and now he has a [ __ ] what what's the run Atlas or home Palace home at EP home fham at South at West home brenford at M United Home wolves before AR it's [ __ ] insane I mean I'm sure they're knocked out of every cup already I mean it they don't they don't have a lot of other things to focus yeah McNeil they they don't even have the luxury of focusing on anything else because they'll get relegated if they do they have to win games so go back over to DCL I mean where is DCL Le frogging Ladro here cuz he is to me I mean [ __ ] a million times yes is not even plan I mean the run is not even it's night and day yeah he's a legit good pick the problem is we only have three forward slots and there's him there's Kai there's Ali there's Holland there's [ __ ] Dom there's you know there there's other guys who will emerge too um but yeah he is a good pick I think that like I haven't really played with the wild card team for now but like there's a good chance yeah yet but there's a good chance that like if I need an enabler I mean 5'9 good nail 90 every game depends I mean the only thing he can't do is being a one-on-one but that's okay we'll get we'll get over that could be I don't know other forwards though people are asking I mean aie said what are your thoughts on Kai after this next game we easy hold or do we try and get Saka instead and Mish said is it Dom time salani time again lot of forward action yeah I mean I'm really uninterested in salanki um should we talk about Spurs Arsenal now sure I mean they're they're doing the same thing that they did last year and it's just nothing's changed and he just showed up so they have Thursday they have a pretty good run of fixtures but yeah it's kind of a good time for them if I if I were a wild card now it's like oh yeah I could yeah I mean they have one bad fixture until Christmas basically at city in November 20 third gaming 12 every other fixture is pretty it's actually kind of a crazy run yeah it's a kind it is kind of a crazy run but I think the P like this is similar to e it's like the pens are just such a huge deal to look at him yeah well I just feel like I'm operating under the assumption that the captain and player who has not missed pens for them over the last couple years will take pens still and its son I agree he's probably like one of their highest ever goal scorers also like he's the guy me operating under this this pretext that he's not on pens it's just I don't see him beating out these other players that we're mentioning for a spot like I just don't see how he's shouldering past any of them in the pecking order if he had pens I think he'd be in he'd be in you know he'd be in the top three yeah yeah but as it stands I think he's just on the outside looking in and you know it is it's interest you know I'm like so Sun just Cooks my head so much all the time cuz I mean I've had such an up and down relationship with him FPL wise over the years like some years it's amazing and some years it's awful and you know I was pretty like out on him at the end of last year just like this player is not good anymore and still I look at the run and I just think like he's playing he a couple braces right like that's all it is it's like he's going to blank blank and then he just pops up with a brace and it's like [ __ ] son classic yeah I mean 10 isn't a good price and you know the brace had against Everton was very fortuitous I think it was yeah pretty pretty lucky but and then you know he's been basically invisible for the other three games and he's going to play as long as he's fit he's starting every you know he's just going to keep starting you know they don't have the team is like it's his team so you know I'm I'm a little bit interested in Sun I don't know if I would actually pull the trigger and put him in my team but he that's like a wild card pick potentially not like someone you're necessarily transferring right it feels like you use your transfer on like higher impact like oh people want Mo this week people want Saka next week or Oli this week whatever like guys you might captain and stuff Oli I mean Sun just feels like sort of if I wild card I could find a way that he's in my team and like I feel like no one has him like there's no way any has him literally I mean you'd have to be insane to have him he's he looks like a terrible pick I mean he's been playing badly and like the team is kind of [ __ ] per owned and there's millions of Koreans in the world so you have to factor that in he's basically negative per owned if you fact that they don't all look the same though as his teammate will Bon core who played played through it yeah with the [ __ ] cor he played through that a difficult take of his but uh yeah Jesus Christ yeah Spurs ah man they are so frustrating to watch and they're just like they're Southampton on steroids like they're just like we're going to [ __ ] dominate the game but also never create a good chance ever like I was I was talk I think I was at the end of last stream I was talking with Jack lad about yeah um Bruno and how there was that one did you listen to the anfield rap when Neil did the solo show the trends he was by himself I don't think I've ever heard it was that like this week or something it was a couple weeks ago okay definitely didn't hear that then so it was like a solo show was just him talking it was like a half an hour and he went app like like he left his body talking about man united and Bruno not Bruno just talking about man united and just how long they've been so B like how bad they've been for how long not only based on like the public perception but also just the numbers like how bad they've been genuinely how bad they've been and you know it got me thinking I mean I mean I always listen with the FPL lens on about Bruno just like he's 85 and he's bad like if if bumo was 85 we'd be we'd be like oh like okay like it's i' would still immediately get him yeah but but like but you know I mean it's just like thinking about where is Bruno at compared to the other midfielders like he's not 85 he should be he should be seven like he should be the same price as buo yeah like their attack is the same as Brenham kind of and you know he doesn't even play Striker you know I mean he's living off this previous reputation of his first year or two under ol and you know where they were attacking out of control they they got a couple extra pens than they typically do and like he banged in these huge years but yeah um but it's sort of similar to me thinking about Spurs where it's like why why is there all this price inflation on a team that to me when I watch them just feels mid like their attack looks midt like it looks just as good as all the midt teams it doesn't look top four it doesn't look top six like why would I spend 10 million on anyone on their team like they don't perform to that level at all and like it's back with sun is like living on previous reputation I know you know he just had 200 points last year but I think there's a lot of M Striker though that's a different yes double dig of his goals were at striker and yeah play Striker no other comps like a lot over as XG as he normally does but you know you still have to mention that and you know so I just look at this team and I'm like there's so many more reasons why I against son than for him and but I still like a moth to Flame I'm like son like same yeah I mean honestly if if man united had nine good fixtures in a row I would be the I would also in a world where I'm like maybe wild card I'd be like maybe I just hold Bruno for nine and hope he gets two pens and two assists and one open Play goal and I'm like that's good that would be amazing if you got yeah that's too bad they already played Southampton so they got their free win out of the way um but yeah all that to say I mean yeah that game was just like I don't know what game it was a noname nothing happened arsenal were very happy with nothing happening and then Saka one of three players who takes every box ticked one of his boxes and gets a [ __ ] assist yeah he scored a corner um I'm starting to get a little bit I mean I know that you know with Arsenal we're looking at them having some injuries so things are a little bit difficult there but missing a lot yeah I mean they played four games they've scored six goals not a lot of goals yeah I'm starting to kind of look back at you know is this just going to be the most conservative pep team we've ever seen and they literally set out to keep it nil nil as long as possible thinking they're going to just fall into the off the set piece or Thea moment of Brilliance because they don't commit men they don't gamble I mean they they don't really do much of anything they just stay in control and command and yeah I mean should we be like we're looking at like oh Kai Saka like home ler home Southampton yeah I mean do you think it's been because it's been the start of the season this little first three game we thing and then injuries and they're going to score five and six sometimes or is this going to be I mean they play every three games hard to say I mean the schedule's been hard really hard um you know home wolves they were not great but they scored two and just killed the game um a away Villa they were bad and scored two goals and killed the game Brighton they actually piled on the most you know attack I've seen from them all season I feel like they created like many good chances even in the first half you know at 11v 11 and then down to man they kept racking up even more chances on the break with Ken Saka so that was almost the most encouraging attacking performance but then yeah I mean no rice no ode but also I think like and this is sort of like a larger point that I I had in my notes is just like everyone kind of played bad after the international break every team that was favored by a goal or more you either lost that bet or push that bet yeah they all City could have been down 3-0 they come back and win 2-1 on you know weird goals Liverpool lose to Forest um Palace were one of them they they [ __ ] 22 bright were one of them they nil nil yeah they lost nil nil Villa are the only one that pushed every other bet lost Villa were down two nil and they're the only one that pushed yeah well man united but yeah but they were not they were not favored by that much because they're United um and they also could have been down one nil and that should have been down one n yeah everyone kind of just came back really sleepy and they're missing rice and they're missing odard yeah I don't know I feel like it was almost just him being like well first of all like this is maybe practice for etad you know like we just need to sit on it take our chances play smart play control nil nil you know prepare for the nil nil but then also I just think you know home luster home Southampton it's like they can't not score I just think they're going to be parked in the attacking third the entire game in both of those um that's fair but yeah I mean it's not been encouraging and we haven't even talked about Liverpool lose one nil don't even reach one XG at home you know another just like flat performance of all these teams after the international break and it's just like what do you do I I kind of grouped Newcastle and Liverpool separately from the others because both of them were I mean Liverpool's the best attack in the League last year Newcastle were fifth best you know by by the numbers last year they both like Liverpool gets zero goals Newcastle somehow get two goals I mean right it's like a sh worldy deflection Barnes worldy they had a couple other chances but it what didn't feel like a two goal game and yet I'm like they had like Liverpool specifically they were just in the final third the whole game all day in transition whole game huge chance missplay pass you know huge cutback chance missplay pass so it's hard to quantify it because it's like like either you believe nfo is not actually this good in their defense isn't this good or you believe Liverpool aren't that good and the first three games were like an anomaly or you know what am I led to believe here I think Liverpool we both think they'll be on track they'll be fine it was a weird bad game Newcastle have been really weird bad start to the season but again like space everywhere all the time just missing on the execution post missing things and yeah it's it was a bad day in the office for Liverpool obviously and you know bad days in the office typically happen when you're away from your colleagues for two weeks and you're working another job with new colleagues for two weeks you know I mean it's like that's what it is it's [ __ ] up and um all of the things can be true right I mean NFL could have played well and you know gotten a little lucky a little rub of the green and you know limited the things and you know but I think the infrastructure and and the way Liverpool have looked the first three you know give us a little bit more than just you know thinking that there's something broken here I I'm not there I mean with Newcastle though I think it's more of like I'm still panicking about them I think that they look I mean I was we were I think you were off but in Discord just look like they're [ __ ] fourth place they've been probably the worst team in every single of their four games they' played actual like they were definitely in the first one down to 10 men definitely I thought they were I thought they were better yeah I mean they they had some counter dominated in the way that to do yeah I mean they did the thing and but like wolves could have beaten them 4-0 and I would been like oh yeah that's what I watched I didn't watch that match and I was I was stunned when I looked at the numbers and watch the highlights cuz you were texting me like wolves had a million chances could have been 40 but like in the numbers and the highlights it just was not bad I mean they had like they had the one tap in that was great and other than that it was like yeah just a couple like mid tier chances um so surpris what you were seeing yeah you need to actually watch it like I don't know you know the numbers are the numbers but there were so many times where there was like a good move where there was some type of lopsided situation going on and then yeah one of their bad players which is like nine of them like did something stupid or you know strand you know whatever it is but by and large like they were just winning every oneon-one like it was just are just let's go one on let's go one verse one everywhere on the pitch and they just beat them everywhere on the pitch pretty much the whole game yeah I mean you don't need to talk me out of Newcastle defense I've been so selling on them for like six months and I feel like this game just like reemphasize that point but where it's hard with Newcastle attack again it's like I feel like I'm like making excuses for their attack every week but it's also not wrong right it's like goran's still creating chances still hitting the post still look ey test good eso's like creating some chances bub gets [ __ ] concussed okay like [ __ ] me you know bad luck or whatever um they created some big chances late in the game when when it was even more open you know tanali and Barnes had big chances and yeah I I think the manager is terrible been on that record for years and you know he's just playing long staff you know I mean they have a couple of players that are so yeah I mean they have a couple of players that are completely incompetent that ruin everything and like even to the point where I look at the defense and I'm like why the actual [ __ ] his Trip's not starting again like we couldn't sell him the turkey like comes in for 30 minutes creates chances yeah go back to the thing that worked like put all the tall guys in the back three and let him play wing and do that and the field and you love to talk about a stench we have not mentioned this Eddie how and the [ __ ] tind director of football not Tindle do you know about that [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah they like don't they don't they like weeks like the [ __ ] whatever is it Mitchell or some [ __ ] like he's like oh the transfers have all been bad and then Eddie has to like come out to the press and defend the play I like all the players we brought in it's like what the [ __ ] is going on they need the the evil robot Saudi woman well she's gone I know that they need it yeah I mean there is it doesn't sound or smell good and you know and it's also right he's this is what the criticism I've had of Edward for years is like he picks the worst players like he picks the worst possible team with the squad he has available almost all the time he finally starts playing Barnes and then he drops him and then he start starts playing hall and then he has to drop hall for Kelly puts I can't play Barnes and Hall I can't play Barnes and Hall it's just so stupid like he's so stupid and bad and dumb and he does such dumb [ __ ] every week I cannot handle the person and the team's [ __ ] a mess they they've won three and drawn one and yet it still feels like he's on the [ __ ] ropes cuz you know Mitchell's Mitchell's got a hard on to get rid of them he can't wait to fire him he'll fire him the first notice he gets that he's allowed to fire him he's going a [ __ ] fire him I know and I know I think they need to fire him I mean how far are they going with they've already hit the heights with Edward it was a couple years ago there's no upside here like this is they could I did forget to bring this up when you were kind of talking about Spurs and how they're just like mid-table I was thinking about it earlier I was like who's the fourth best team cuz I think that is very not obvious cuz it could be [ __ ] Spurs could be Chelsea could be Newcastle could be villa villa are there I think I think Villa I think it's Villa they're okay I I'm not like buying stock and them finishing fourth at all I would I would buy bright I mean no that's come on that's insane I would buy I think it's crazy I would buy The Villa stock I think Chelsea are also reasonable just because of the she the sheer quality of players that they have at every position is like you and I could co-manage like Edward Tindall style and I think we would do pretty well with Chelsea we' do pretty well with this Chelsea Squad like it's just they have 100 play 100 pound players and 50 million pound player backups at like every spot onam play mostly well I mean the win against Bournemouth was scam but like they beat the [ __ ] out of Palace which ended 1-1 and they obviously scored six goals against wolves and they played okay against City you know for enzzo's first match you know they played fine yeah I mean the thing with Villa I mean look Europe could destroy them I do hope that um that eings is able to kind of manage the squad and you know players like Barkley and are going to be really advantageous for them in that regard Bia andan and [ __ ] I just the biggest thing with me for them is is Duran like having another Striker that can clearly score goals is something that all of these teams in the fourth place conversation that we're discussing don't have and you know you can make maybe the AR Spurs but yeah Chelsea and maybe Spurs to to some extent with Rich but he's never available so you know I don't know if that even counts not really the the argument for Spurs would be like it's Dom and then move sua Striker is like the backup I mean Chelsea Chelsea have goal scores and you know and so do Villa but you know Villa also has the winner this week in cuckoo he Subs on Subs on he looks great and yeah they have a lot of depth there it's it's more of like that's a basket case with a lot of new [ __ ] going on so how is that going to go consistently but Phil it's just like a lot of steady stable [ __ ] with a couple of tweaks around the edges in the in the periphery with a couple like you know Rogers coming into the fold and you know the defense we'll see how the defense settles but you know when they get Mings back Diego Carlos back like all of a sudden you're looking and like okay like they could they could they could fight two they could fight on two front so I mean ifting them off but I'm just saying like to me they're just another team in the group it's not clearly I'm totally with you the the group is there's a few teams and like if I was betting I would bet on Villa yeah yeah I do actually wonder what the betting ons are I have no idea but um let's I think we have can just throw a really Rogue thing in there yeah yeah yeah I still think that there's really really something with West Ham this year like I just think there's something there yeah they they win the late the the late Point iny yeah [ __ ] I just I feel like lope tegui like after a couple months is gone the first 11 is as good as any team in the league like talk about fourth place that first 11 can finish in fourth place I'm I'm very certain of that with pack and fullest KRW kudus Bowen well full KRW has to play before oh yeah he has to like not go to Germany again Alvarez Somerville like they have too when he start kilman like 1B I mean they have they they're they're good I think they're going to be good they've been pretty bad so far but they've had really difficult fixtures um you know I mean it wouldn't surprise me when they're playing once a week and everyone's back and you know he can kind of ride them and get them into the patterns of play that he wants that they could go on a really big run and be a really tough out for the top teams like I agree with the tough out part it's it's just hard when they're sitting here with one win one draw two losses already they're going to have to Le [ __ ] teams yeah no you're that's fair that's I mean it would it would take a lot but I feel like they're one of the more yeah they're one of the more Roger teams I I just I really like that I really like the way the Squad Squad look so yeah we'll see yeah and Bournemouth I like too I don't think they're fourth but like they're going to cause a lot of problems C cver on pens now pick is he definitely because EV so [ __ ] bad at pens should be I mean Tav is also like two for two in his career or something [ __ ] Tav but it was the same [ __ ] as uh glasner but he said he was like it's the two of them yeah so uh they chose and they they picked they rolled the wrong choice I should have yeah that also [ __ ] is insane to me that managers don't set that initially like they're too py they're so [ __ ] to [ __ ] say it's you and not you because they want to like massage both of them like it's a democracy on the field when they're emotional and football thing that we will never understand there is American sport in a flagrant foul and it's like you five decide who takes the free throw inad of feeling that it's like no our best free throw ridiculous he's the only one that ever takes it and everyone knows it's insane and if he's not in the pitch it's this guy this guy this guy this guy in that order it's crazy it's it's really bizarre um we're kind of jumping around there's one more topic I want to touch on and then get to questions and everything else will just move until you know Friday my life Thursday pod but so WIA is just out for months shot shot's my guy heyo benj said is shot straight in with a whist out for months I love the match up for Spurs in the river of green pictures seems great x50 with WIA and Thiago out and bredford having great running fixures is shot a pick am I crazy or is Shota just like an incredible pick how does he stack up against your other incredible pick friend mcneel they're the two best picks in the game no obviously if Shota is the striker he's the better pick strike I mean Striker he's obviously playing up top with bumo up top well it's not that obvious though because I was thinking about it earlier you think it could be KP and car and car or what carvalo yeah it could be carvalo you think it could be car well they're going to play three all look all these fixtures the Spurs is a little bit but from that they have a run where they're playing three forward so you know it's between it seems like when they play a back three which is not relevant but I'm just talking it out loud but be for this weekend yeah it will be for this weekend when they play it back three it seems like KP is basically left wing back Wing back yeah and then they play two forwards and so we think it'll be shaab bumo but it could be carvalo buma yeah and then in games where they're you know favored whatever there's three yeah I don't know I just think that the two with carve won't work he's just not an outlet like how is he going to be in the game if it's just him and bumo the thing he's a really weird player and I haven't watched him that much because he's always been on loan but I do know you know he scored nine goals at whole last year he B he played forward in like half the games yeah he wasn't really playing like he's not really a wide man he's like a number 10 or a nine and a half weiro yeah so like if you're going to ask me let me put it this way if both of them get 2,000 forward minutes or something like that who scores more goals I think it's carvalo yeah for sure really score goals better and like he'll assist more and he'll win pens and he's just really good but like I don't know it depends what he values I think yeah no I mean I'm I'm with you on shot I think he's a really good pick I do think that he's going to be ahead of car on the packing order me too that would both this weekend and moving forward I feel like it's going to be more like carve and KP maybe fight and like damgard I mean they they just don't have they don't have any dard anymore no I know well he plays them periodically but I mean they just don't have anybody so I mean you're really looking at bumo sha and carve like when they play three up that's what it has to be and he'll probably play play KP at I mean or he's just not going to play in those games or maybe maybe it's also KP cuz he doesn't want to play yeah so [ __ ] love sh dude I was shouting shot in pre-season like 5 five he's [ __ ] and I was saying like it will take multiple injuries for that to be a thing and here we are multiple injuries multiple in I think like he played so few top level minutes but in those minutes he's does really good [ __ ] yeah so I mean and it's it's really difficult because him and mcneel both have a very similar very long very good run and I mean you look if you're on wild card you could build a team with both yeah no problem and and put money elsewhere you know I mean you could do some funky [ __ ] because there's and you know we're not even talking about seeno but all of a sudden you I mean yeah sorry had the assist I don't think he's really a pick but all of a sudden you know we're looking at like multiple sub six million midfielders that look good so you know you could kind of dude an ESR under the radar I know he gets subbed every game but he's actually been huge for me points in four weeks yeah I mean the assist was just everything and the goal obviously sick [ __ ] assist and he gets you know he gets a bone and then yeah the 10 pointer in the other game I I can't ask for more yeah no and he could also just be someone that you just hold forever like he's just going to be doing this like all year and just trickling in with you know points and the T just like we've talked about F every year with mil is like they play to the level of their opposition they're fine they're always going to be fine they're always going to finish in 12th or whatever yeah I mean listen if I'm if I wild guard he's probably not making the team he not he's not jumping these other guys but but it's at least another name in that price bracket that if you set your team up in this way you've got seeno ESR Shota Dwight you know I mean these are four guys that are under six that if you build your team and Rogers we haven't even mentioned who just [ __ ] I don't even own him and I'm still offended by what happened fine I own him starting every week basically I think I was just rooting for you so hard that it was just too disgusting to even like comment on like there are so many guys in this price bracket that yeah you know maybe that is the best way to build the team cuz where there are not players are in the price bracket between six and seven and a half or six and like 10 yeah honestly like there's not that many you know kai aside if we're just talking about like midfielders well he's a forward but he's a forward yeah so I'm saying like forget about him I mean there's like Kev and foden which are just like I don't [ __ ] know they're going to get some points but like I don't know then there's Bruno odard Diaz jota who are now both rotation RIS both getting subbed early mat Bowen's pick shout out to Bowen shout out to Walsh's Bowen oh not a yeah three three returns of four good yeah Gordon I mean yeah there there's really very few guys e gets a downgrade marnelli is bad rashford ra maybe Razzle emerges the best pick in the actual I was also looking at Kevin how actually insane it is that he's played n basically 90 minutes all year and he's at two returns it's just impossible yeah I mean he's he is a pick in game week seven if or like even game week six wild cards I think that there's a possibility that like you have Holland Saka and Kev like can that be a team like I think I think it can be a team like when is is he he can't play [ __ ] 4,000 minutes though like is he just gonna [ __ ] is he gonna [ __ ] him because he's leaving all I know is he's fit now and he's playing now and he's still the second best player on the team yeah and you know I don't know they need to win some game so I don't know this pod could easily go on for another two hours is what I'm sensing so let's jump to questions bang some out move on WE you also have fantasy Champions League you have to navigate I'm good I have my team's set I mean benett Ben has any any fuckle fantasy Champions League shouts I don't have any I don't even know lot of shot like who are the I don't have my team open who's the best pick in the game in that game let me open my team I mean there are 15 of them and they're all on my team let put it that way there's too many I opened the thing there's too many teams I'm not participating in this I will very happily enjoy it from afar yeah this is going to take my computer 10 minutes open so ccle back um well we just talked about all these glue guys but I mean big dunks and jaia are kind of asking us to like rank the glue guys seeno McNeil ESR Rogers boomo bone I don't think bumo and Bone qualify for glue necessarily do they bumo does yeah I guess so I bumo is the best of all of them yeah for sure um yeah I mean seeno just keeps putting up numbers and they're they're at anfield this week but then it's home they just have such [ __ ] mixed fixtures don't want to play them this week don't want to play them in eight don't want to play them in 10 which is kind of annoying and hard to navigate but I guess if you're wild card you can navigate that yeah I mean the issue with seeno is as good as he looks every every game I watch him is just the he has no avenues like his literal only Aven is open play and you know when you're looking at the picks around the game it's hard for that to Trump you know players that have more than just the singular Avenue um and it's not like like Bournemouth have been good but it's not like they create a million chances and they're so attacking it's like not the case at all you know that that's been the case it it could change when they have better fixtures and they don't have better fixtures for a while so yeah you know we're looking at the next you know five six they obviously have the Southampton leer game and they have you know bad fixtures in and around those they're really good fixture run starts in game M 11 where they have a really wide birth but um um you know I mean I think it's interesting like seeno to to shot for example and yeah you know I mean shot is going to be playing forward so seeno sort of plays forward like a little bit more wind and yeah a little bit wider but you know those are those are close calls so yeah I'd rather have shot yeah I mean it's it's also the fixtures matter like you know maybe you want shot for the next five or six and then you get seeno but I I might basically with seeno is he has to have good fixtures like you're not playing this in bad fixtures and that is the same for all of these five5 mids like literally all of them SEO McNeil ESR Rogers Shota yeah yeah if they have bad fixtures you don't want to play them mean the main difference where it's like Jiao Pedro's interesting or DCL is interesting is that doesn't matter because they have pens they have pens so you know where you're putting your five five picks you know with it's mid or the third forward or what you know all of this kind of adds up to you know which one fits best in your team um just to to look at it in those ways right yeah yeah totally agree all right I got my uh fuckle team up okay back to fuckle yeah what are we looking at here so we got few Mill in the bank because we don't need that much money in this game you know no big deals I don't know I love hearing about it then we have tan and D Gregorio in goal he's the uve goalie classic defense is chan oh my God obviously a legend I love beston so much cambiaso who's some uve Defender who's like forward or something and cambiaso classic Cen cambiaso a classic hakeim is in there love them of course pong's in there obviously love him Midfield we have pulik obviously American has to have American representation Raph in Easy in wartz didn't have him in Europe Euros so we put him in here M cuz it's [ __ ] oh my God yeah M Alis cuz I mean well how could I not have Alis that was the first name I put in my team by easily captain and then the oh easy Captain I knew I I know you I know my dude that's the first thing that's the first thing it's like oh and they play the first time why you play it's like just to be able to do that yeah and then I've got fahashi up top Celtic genius okay Gores he scores a [ __ ] million goals right for aashi yeah yeah yeah yeah he'll keep it up korus on sporting forward okay genius oh yeah that guy is yeah everyone talking about that guy yeah and then ADM Benfica back to his roots it's because you're watching the documentary you got D Maria that's right love that yeah love it great team those are they answer the question previous those are all the best picks in the game yeah um Josh B said keeper talk is Ria worth a free transfer if I hendo let's compare their points and see how that's played out so far Rya got more points this week than hendo has had all year combined ry's on 29 and hendo's on eight and if we do the math from earlier where you're third 12 points higher than me and you're 350,000 places higher than me okay let me do a little math here I think I'd be like top 5K if I had goalkeeper matters a lot well especially if what you were talking about in Discord is true and Riot just keeps farming Bones on every clean because they're going to keep a lot of cleans especially when they play like that oh so far so true I mean he kept more saves than he typically would but even I think even if he had a couple less saves I think he still would have been clear of uh let me have a look over here what are we doing he was still eight ahead of Saka he could have had two or three less saves and still you know been in two or one bonus look I mean the next closest BPS was white on 23 and Rya got 33 that's a huge gap I mean five saves is a lot but you know say he made save is worth two BPS yeah so if he made two or three it's only six or eight less yeah yeah he's still you know he's still pretty comfortably clear and you know on Bones over the Defenders youba CBA got a card so he would have been up to 25 if he didn't it's getting closer but again it's back to it just it's close and when you get it he gets two more dude he's [ __ ] ridiculous ridiculous like it's actually ridiculous yeah I mean I think like people who wild card this week people who Wild Card next week it just seems like everyone is just waiting to Wild Card to like make that move and if you can make the move without having to wild card that's even better but this everyone that was wild carding this week didn't get him because the city I don't know they got for buan or you know they listen to me lrod we were saying like he's the only guy to get we don't get any of the Defenders get him yeah I mean me too I we've been saying this for for the whole last two weeks but yeah Rya dude it's just it's so painfully obvious and it's like I mean who was that [ __ ] I'm sorry to call out friends from Discord but who is the absolute [ __ ] Savage psycho who wildcarded into hendo keeper remember that moment this weekend he's like who can I get the actual worst pick in his position this is my guy for the next 20 weeks that guy needs to re wild he got hacked email official F you got hacked and he's just using a transfer there but Rya yeah it's just so obvious yeah yeah it's just free real estate um guy said four weeks in I still feel like we don't have a strong sense of which teams are actually good Outside The Usual Suspects filla and Newcastle are up in the top five but feel unconvincing is it's still too early to know yeah yeah I guess we kind of talked about that already yeah yeah and you know we're going to start looking at a whole new game now that Europe's starting you know we're GNA have to start taking really close notes on how managers are rotating and how they're using their squad so you know we'll see there I I also I wanted to ask you also about Rico cuz you know got the halftime sub that was x50 is next thing he said it's it time to start panicking about Rico like I mean you're you're not onlooker how do you see this with him Arsenal next you know Europe starting Kyle played you still just start him every week I think yeah I mean halftime sub is very UNP to me and that it's it was also warranted because that game was completely out of control and they were lucky to not be down 2-0 or 3-0 as pep also said in the in the postmatch so you know I think it was just a weird situation they're still integrating Roger back in and as soon as rogery came back in the game was over um so I still think like any time Rico starts he's the best four five you have he should start and in games when he doesn't start you're just praying he stays on the bench I still think the same rules apply yeah especially now that R's back yeah yeah I'm with you I mean that's how I was looking at it I mean people were pretty frantic and panicking about it there's nothing like it it's just I don't know there's so many complications to fpl but if everyone was [ __ ] flying this week everyone in Discord was flying this week and that happened to Rico they would just be like oh [ __ ] love Rico whatever it matter won't happen all the disasters it's just like [ __ ] and Rico like I have to [ __ ] yeah know just relax I mean the concern with Rico is he starts midweek which you know that would be bad for but also I don't even know if it would be bad for him well I think because say it is but then but no I I understand but then you look at that and you think okay well that means he's playing three center backs and Kyle against Arsenal yeah prob play I don't think he'll play versus Arsenal which also as you've said is not bad that's fine even though that's probably going to be a nil nil so so like do you should I start him or we'll talk about it after the midweeks I guess we'll talk about it after the midweeks but it would be nice I think to figure it out now before we get biased from the midweeks to me what are other options well I have po just chilling yeah po wolves I mean too yeah I mean it's I I mean I don't know about yeah but uh I mean to me I imagine that Rico's going to start midweek and not start against Arsenal like that's how this going that would be really logical but I just think pep is like very illogical and sometimes he does stuff that we don't think about so it's not even worth trying to think about it I don't really think that like this means that I think it's much more complex than that so it's just if I have him I need to just don't even think or look at if he's fit just start him I think so yeah okay I mean if he's not fit you can just him too he'll still get autoed you know yeah yeah yeah yeah fine with that I'm fine with that yeah I think that's where I come down okay um let's see I don't know we could probably push all these I think to well there's a couple lifestyle ones maybe we do those and then wrap it up and push everything else to Thursday yeah yeah sounds good FL Doom said um why do you support your specific New York teams why Mets not Yankees why Jets and Giants and not Giants Jets family reasons geographical reasons or other reasons you start start off with this one yeah I can start yeah I mean my dad is from Brooklyn and was a huge Brooklyn Dodgers fan AKA Yankees Enemy Number One he [ __ ] despises everything to do with the Yankees and I was raised that way and uh I also despise them and uh why Jets I think it's just my brothers it's just like the team that we always rooted for I don't even there was no point in my life when I decided it was just like oh yeah I'm a Jet fan yeah I don't know so yeah that's it yeah yeah it was more it was more circuitous for me because my parents didn't watch sports or know anything about sports their whole lives so I mean my mom's from Queens and like that's whatever but for me it was more just like my friends and it took me like a few different teams to get to like any of to the Mets like I was like oh I like this team or that team or yeah I like I like Allen Iverson so like that team um but like I think as I got older into like more Middle School age and you know I half my friends are Giants fans half for jets fans half for Mets fans half half for Yankees fans I just got to like pick the ones that resonated more with me at the time and for me it just fell into Mets and Giants so yeah that's how how it went for me that's how it is I will say as a Jets fan still one of the all-time great Sports moments I think in both of our Lives was at you're visiting me with a bunch of other friends at Marty we're all [ __ ] blacked out Insanity I didn't black out until after we no until after but you know what I mean just trying to represent the the chaos around us and then Giants beat the in the Super Bowl yeah outside outside insane um and then the other lifestyle question is MC marman he said does your love of FPL in sports General ever create friction with your partner or is it just me wow well you're newly partnered how are you doing over there with shars yeah I mean there's a little friction here and there not gonna lie ngls yeah not going to lie when it comes to Footy it's easier for two reasons one I it's my job and so you know I'm like I got to watch this shout out to FML hey it's an income source and the other reason is it's [ __ ] early not as early as it is on the west coast but it's like I can reason be like I'll be done by noon some week some days I'll be done by two some days whatever and we can still do [ __ ] during the day do [ __ ] at night when it comes to NFL though it's kind of a hard it's like when I was single same with you when you're single you can't do the 1 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. I'm watching football that is not acceptable so you just got to suck it up and that's just not reality anymore yeah I mean if you're an a real intense sports fan like we are it is in inevitably FR frictitious fractious has to be with your wife it's just it has to be because it's all you want to do and they don't give a [ __ ] about it it's like they could not care they could not give a [ __ ] they couldn't tell you one player and one League you know kind of thing so but yeah I mean it's you know you and I have that that little cheat card where it's like like oh we're making money on this so we have to in air quotes have to do it which is you know partially true but also you know we could we could get by by you know watching games in other times and this and that but it's fun to watch it live and we look forward to it so we want to do it but exactly yeah it's all bargaining like it's all about you know what's reasonable what are my responsibilities I mean I have a kid you don't like so that changes things and you have to look at the equation and prioritize like if I were single the amount of sports I watch would probably be 400% more than what I if not higher than what I watch now when you factor in baseball it's every [ __ ] night I mean when when hours every night yeah when Lauren's not here all I do is sports are on all the time it's not it's not ever off like people have hobbies like they go play golf like I just like watching sports like that's all I want to do like I'm happy so happy to watch sports like I could do it every day all day I just love watching Sports and thinking about it and all the things so yeah like when Lauren's not here for a couple days like I mean I have Dam so that's a bit like yeah I just I would just watch sports like I would just watch sports nonstop and the one Edge I have and you know it's I have to Pat myself on the back here because I'm really good at getting people into [ __ ] and Sharon is just in on NFL she just [ __ ] loves the drama of football loves watching loves like the pace of it she couldn't give a [ __ ] about baseball unless we're there soccer whatever loves NFL so there's you know we we do some errands we do some stuff on Sundays but then it's like all right well I'm gonna come back put the game on she's like yeah yeah put it on put it on I'm like yes I'm gonna sit here for the next eight hours hopefully yeah yeah that's how it goes that's how it goes yeah but you have like you can't like watch sports over your relationship that's insane so you just have to mature and figure out like you have to mature and realize what's actually important yeah or start a podcast and start earning money and both yeah exactly yeah s of I think the the biggest cheat code would be if you had a successful gambling podcast because then you could spend anything is like no I got it yeah I gotta watch I put 20K on this this is a huge match for the you know blah blah blah but you already put 20K so does it matter if you watched it oh it matters so much I got to talk about it I have got the guy on Tuesday all right uh yeah we'll push all the other questions I think to Thursday let me slap asses we haven't PED in a while so we got some asses we got Max mure Taylor Hyde Ben Eva Rory button William peek Benny the potato King Stanley ipus James Sia Andrew quter Arie Magnuson scalpin Macklin O'Neal Dan baby get in you thank you for all your new signups Stanley ipkiss that's from a movie or something it doesn't sound real it's Jim car's name from The Mask okay I knew there was something up there good job by you dude whatever your real name is it's probably Tom Alias is online is funny you got Alias who are you hiding from like my team name is Alon and your team name is Walsh they'll never know who are you hiding from yeah man um yeah H God am I going to rip wild card I don't know I'll talk to you I'm sure all day tomorrow or something or you'll just tell me you did it on Thursday or I'll just sneak attack you yeah sneak attack we'll see any last words see you tomorrow check us out field.com follow us on Twitter ffield Sports Page instram sub",17898,support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay were going to von this walsh how we doing much more somber watch this episode but we i sm moving along im always smiling its just its sm i either smile cuz its smile or im smile to hold back the tears this is one of those but i was thinking about our both of us on fat reds and i was just like this is the week were getting tested like this is can we hold our nerve can we keep our good players like yada y yada or are you you got im on 200k i didnt expect it to be honest but i think its just like my scattered onep pointers isach off at half nico didnt start and hendo just the actual worst pick in the game worst player in the league i would have thought for you at 51 would have just treaded water because of how poor everyone else did besides captain holland but i thought so everyones also still at this early stage so bunched up point total wise that every few points is like a huge amount of i bet you im like 10 points away from like 150k crazy like that well how many 10 points is a lot 40 no im i know your week was bad your overall points 300 301 i know so 301 so youre 11 or 12 higher than me and youre probably what 300000 places im 180k youre 35000 places ahead of me 10 points is a huge amount of points so 51 bad job by me after mentioned dean hendo this guy 2141 palace defense complete mess disaster every game yep onep pointer por0 2 nico doesnt start i had i had 10 men ian how nico played 10 minutes so thats the equivalent of 10 men for me every point counted this week you had 10 men but i had like the one pointers got the pen didnt take it did he get the pen didnt get that gordon blank mo the eso situation i was running a sausage fest in the park no ones going to know what the im talking about but i was running orders i checked my phone walsh just like eso subed at half like what the vision blurred hes probably concuss i dont even know the bloody nose doesnt make your vision blurry but it was bad the real worry for me now is i transferred in j pedro hes knocked herzler is a fraud were not going to know anything unless he plays in the cup game esos heard eddies a fraud were not going to know anything barcos not in the premier league and sunar is hurt and im sitting here have two frees i was planning on completely chilling until my wild card in six now its like i havent popped anything i havent touched a thing can never tell with you no and sometimes you sometimes you throw it on me on the pod like its happened before thats true its happened happen before im trying to find pod boys wheres the pod boys leag we need to spend some time looking at your your team thatll be more a thursday thing but well it cant be a thursday thing if youre wild carding you got to do it thats got to be a now thing its true i already missed two rounds of price changes but who cares i certainly dont unless if youre avoiding drops like which i dont know maybe you did have a drop but double price like thats not a thing anymore like double triple price risers like that just doesnt happen they diddle it too hard and they have their finger on the scale too hard its its still like you cant possibly lead you cant point to anything other than salani to indicate how fraudulent this game is right what he went down once or not even he has not price changed he got hes had like 2m sales and he hasnt price changed they just mispriced him because or they mispriced him conceivably if he was on spurs so theyre just like were just not going to price change were not going to change his price gaming two thats what it is 855000 transfers out gaming 3 800000 transfers out g mc four 350000 transfers out no price change no price change so thats why they dont tell us the formula cuz there isnt one and they just do whatever they want and they make a mistake accurate so team walshire not good not a good week not good another week without holland tough i it was nothing if not a mistake to take holland out of my team i think we 100 know yet until this game and next game where theyre the only two weeks of the season where he maybe wont be the number one cat thats a zero percenter because hes already on he has more goals than any team in the league the last two weeks hes on 60 points cuz its double cap on both weeks and its so its i got away max absolute max punish i got away with it last week because i happened to get points elsewhere and mo equal him but didnt happen this week not by a long shot mo was invisible washed version of himself he was and everyone was terrible the only returns i got were olly and rya everyone else was a one a triple onep pointer in defense with trent lewis and robo and then i had just blanks everywhere else it was just unbelievable carnage and yet youre still 180k its just the thing where it feels so bad is that i used all my chips and then and i talked a few moments ago that everyones bunched up but it just feels so bad to like give it all back right away almost like this week thats what it feels like you thats why i said at the beginning like this is the week thats going to test us the next two weeks like i have your team is still good holland is not the best cap and well see how it goes but thats where it is for me is like this week the best can hope for is going back to where i was last week so like thats how im my sights are angled as like the best case scenar and thats just bad like thats a bad job so you had an 8m gaming crank its not high not high not high but i think overall things are mostly fine the right did right i think im going to have to defer the league updates cuz didnt do them it all right dude game week five onto game week five but what are we talking about from last week where do you want i want to start i think e is the biggest talking point god dude that how disgusting was that it was i was so el gut punch i was just so elated for me like 75 seconds between the pen and then watching bald huge tuck in shirt i transferred in pedro and e and im like ah pedro doesnt not even in the squad hurz fraud blah as a saves the day here it comes max bones easy me us so mish said do we hold as an hope heim said is mata stri does he make it into the three best forwards on the wild card over watkins or kai jb is muno is an immediate cell hes wild carding six but still maybe immediate cell and fering said our palace now just a large garbage barge that should be fire sold well there are mean these are all palace question but where do you stand with as we didnt know ahead of the game but glasner said we have mata and as two pen takers and then he lets them sorted on the field where do you stand more annoying that he said that way more annoying i agree gives us more one theyll take turns the trepidation of saka odard handing each other pens because theyre friends like that situation but its hard to its hard to like rank how much of a downgrade it is if what like all i know is its a big downgrade cuz he just got from saturday till now he just got minus five goals on the season you just subtract five random 10point hauls from the season and thats bad that makes him from a great auto pick to hes an okay pick the fixtures arent good home man united away everton might be good but who knows when bran is coming back home liverpool at forest home spurs i its just not good you this is not a player that you would bring in for this fixture run if you knew ahead of time he wasnt on pence and now we have him and were just like im not even sure this is a good pick so thats where im at hes never going to be a bad pick because hes still a good player but hes a bad pick hes just not best pick like in what universe would you buy him from this point forward there isnt one i think it would have to be a real good fixture on thats what i was trying to say maybe 10 through 14 at wolves home fulham at villa home newcastle at ips switch or 18 through 25 whatever point stands you would never buy him for the run that hes currently on and yet here we are with him its it feels horrible dude its terrible i wait it feels like i just lit a free transfer well two free transfers on absolute fire also that he had the goal gami one rolled out cuz of the ref thing y and then this one like youre looking at he could be on 40 30 to whatever 30 something points top four mid in the game he could be it could be mo diad saka as right now easily and its like these are just hes just a beta and thats what were seeing before our eyes i know put fo down thats whats going on here so i dont want him i feel like im going to get rid of him as soon as i possibly can im going to keep him this week because im im saving for sure but he still has avenues hes still hes still classy he still shoots a lot but this is just the power of pens where its like we have a bizarre layout of our fixtures where we dont have a good fixture window at any point this season which happens to some teams sometimes like there isnt think the run i laid out is good enough i dont i dont i dont agree cuz youre looking at some tough ways and f are always a tough game if switches it but then youre looking a five i dont think fulhams good i think villas pretty poor newcastle we dont know what theyre going to look like in november regardless a team like us like a good fix run youre looking at you want in a six game five or six game week window like multiple home games with home in way of the promoted sides and like we just dont have that maybe things will change but just looking at it now and when you dont have that the pens are the things that buoy him to be feeling like in your head as like an elevated pick where okay well theres a bad one theres a good one theres a medium one theres a good one theres a medium one doesnt matter we went a pen ne all neckti was doing the whole game was diving like were going to win probably seven pens this year between e and him and like thats what were going to do and maybe two maybe hell take two so youre subtracting 40 points from his total so hes going from knocking on 190 to being like 150 and thats just not a pick i think a lot of people listening to this probably are thinking like were overreacting hes still good p but heres another way to put it imagine a world where bumo is not on pens what are we talking about no ones transferring him in i hes on the 15th best team at best in the league and theyre they barely score and all they do is set piece and throw in play like im good easy pass on bumo and yet im sitting here its ging five theyre at spurs and im like i cant believe i dont have buma on my team like im a idiot for not having boomo on my team especially with the way the bonus points are this year it seems like if you score a goal youre at least get an a bonus point if not all of them so as its just its just unfortunate very unfortunate i have a note a little note in my phone going this week and after that moment i had to start it in my this is how i get my frustration out i was like who takes every box because e just got removed from that list and the list is very short players its bumo its bruno palmer i dont i dont think brunos on the list honestly his open play threat is too low for me decreased so saka bumo palmer and then the one cheap guy that no one talks about except for me and pre mgw no yes no every box is ticked hes also like just he doesnt shoot he shoots sometimes he shoots enough maybe once a game no he shoot he shoots more than that but im not with you on mg i feel like weve reversed roles with mgw where i had him on wolves before they transferred him to like the flamp and he was like removing im good at that i do that every year youve done that multiple times but he plays deep he doesnt shoot hes not on set pieces anymore hes not on set pieces anymore so hes youre right youre right we dont also we dont know he depends like you could show me wood taking the next like this could bea they only won one pen they only won one pen last year because theyre wolves and he took it but wood wasnt on the pitch okay im moving him so its sakaba palmer thats it from the midfielders from anyone any forward midfielder defender everyone in the game those are the only players who take every box i think its a little bit unfair to compare that i think like the set piece situation just because strikers dont take set pieces like i think they have to be removed in that okay but its a its a box for me though thats why midfielders are better and score more points thats son hes almost definitely on pens i dont think he takes corners doing mats doing it and some idiot you could argue for that but also were not 100 trees on pens also thats true it could be dom right youre saying could be dom it hes a the season okay so hes off corners which is probably good to conserve his energy cuz there was a time when he was i remember he was like taking a lot of corners and he was he getting some cheeky assist he took 150 corners in 21 season but i think its those three guys are the only ones who tick every box and that means like open play goal threat open play assist threat set pieces pens corners mos not on set pieces ind indirect right its just that avenues i was talking about the avenues last pod right or maybe that was the thursday half the corners but its corners is pretty good about like trent right like you dont consider clean sheets an avenue but he would be on zero points if clean sheets werent an avenue right and he got three clean even though everyone missed his chances so its just its just something i was looking at removed as he off hes off its such a nightmare maybe it should just be not you have to be on corners or you have to be on set pieces but combined like you take enough dead balls that its like a it should be like a number i can easily make this like a chart where its like you have to pass these thresholds well its also like ranking the value of the set pieces direct fre direct free kicks are the most valuable indirect set pieces from like elbow range and then corners last so those are probably similar like the corner crosses to sorry corner cross to like an elbow cross im sure theyre like not that different but what its just something interesting so definitely but what about mata is he now just like a this equally makes him a much better pick because he just added five goals right so thats alarming in a good way right hes a pick hes a pick for sure he was already flirting with pick status and now look weve had a tumultuous couple months here and now that we have the squad that we have i feel like glar is going to be able to get and we have lowkey had a lot of changes like a lot of changes last year so many changes its in the engine room its at center back its its at wing its like almost every area of the team has been bad job that it all happened in the last week of the window except alis like it just its this team does not know each other it happened its done with and now here we are today so i do think that we will continue to improve if the season progresses and mateta 75 just good ne ti is good we have good players were going to keep playing better and i think that were going to be in good shape in about a month or so also i just i dont know what the hell gay hes up to but watching those highlights and hes been sniffing glue i think hes huffing nitrous before every game as a warmup and its like he just looks like hes 45 years old cant turn cant run all his touches are bad im like what is this guy is so good and now hes bad i dont know whats happening he looks like he needs a few weeks off honestly which i also no its not coming i also think that theres a lot more responsibility on his shoulders with anderson gone like i think anderson was more like ar like like van d like telling everyone where the theyre supposed to be and now i think thats falling gay like set the line and do all that and hes playing with fuing seltzer on his and kle on his right and its like what the is this if you have to compensate for playing with kleene anyones going to look bad playing next to klein behind pressure so weve got and like munoz right mentioning earlier its the defense is just not there at all so you just shouldnt you shouldnt have the defenders lroy just came in and its its going to take some time y okay speaking of palmer because we did get two palmer questions and mishka said deep analysis of the chelsea game what did you learn should expectations for what should expectations for palmer be and then he lists all his stats which were bad and then elon said any concerns about palmer im thinking of using him as a cash cow next week so what is he a couple weeks removed from a 50p pointer and he had a 17p pointer six pointer one blank and now everyones selling whats happening its its an overreaction but i think there are some mning signs that are worth taking note they hes just peripheral in a lot of a lot of as was in that game and its wolves i think are well come on to wolves when we talk about wolves later but outside of that like it seems like the enemy is just okay lets mark him and take him out of the game and then well deal with the rest and hes not getting into threatening position so much and hes doing a lot of his work around the edges and in peripheral areas of the pitch and its he has a lot of avenues as you mentioned previously with the pens and the all the other all the other bits there hes expensive and when they make three attacking subs every game and its three strangers for three strangers and they play on thursday all year its like what does this team jelling look like and when it does gel whos taking the shots its its probably not going to be palmer that much its almost to me i feel like hes going to turn into like oil where hes like look last year he got 10 penalty goals and he did score a lot of beautiful goals and im im probably going a little too hyperbolic in terms of like decreasing palmers goal output or potential but last year he scored 22 that will be his career high i feel like i would bet any amount of money that he will never score more than 22 league goals in his career no one gets 10 pens a game like it happens one time ever and his shot his just his shot out outputs not there to level what you need an open play period so what where do his points come from the assists are nice but the change of the bonus system deflates the value of those there arent 6 point assist goal scorers getting six point assists arent a thing anymore so where does he land probably still hit somewhere in the 180 200 range but is he just like a hold forever im not sure i know last week were looking at it and saying okay hes just underpriced still and he still might be but im just trying to look at it a little bit more like how does it go wrong and i can see how thats it like thats where i where what i was watching on the bournemouth game right for me the biggest takeaway from that game wasnt necessarily like palmer might be a bad pick its bournemouth is just not a great fixture b they everything up they press you to death they up your buildup they win a lot of their battles aial monsters they win their battles theyre physical they they just kick the out of palmer thats what they did you want to progress the bot of palmer were going to foul him every single time and or two men in front of him and he cant like he just couldnt get the ball from that like right space to the center and he couldnt find space couldnt find any space ever and like you said well get to them later i think that like the cap this week maybe thats where we should go next but and weve seen a bunch of bournemouth games now and they have not had good fixtures right like evertons good but like now we think more highly of nfo home newcastles not easy to completely shut them down and they completely battered the out of the better they were better than them by a l they were better than chelsea too they miss a pen lose one nil but they were just better so that was my bigger takeaway i was looking at like some of their stats and stuff their third lowest buildup percentage against first by a very large margin in league in high turnover they missed the pen thats what im saying so theres going to be teams that are like the top best buildup teams in the league like we would think of like desery brighton hes not there anymore city arsenal dont know if liverpool are like big tbd they havent played like a great pressing team at all yet so well see if they can bust through but im with you right now if i had oly i would be captaining oly but circling back im with im agree with you completely on the bouth standpoint we have to we have to update our how we look at them completely and comprehensively i think going back to the polymer situation its you hes again with the a hes never going to be a bad pick like hes hes going to get returns hes going to get points hes too good but i definitely think that if you need money you can look there like i dont think thats egregious and hes not in hes not in that many teams and like do i want polymer in medium fixtures when i could have saka in good fixtures no not close do i want to have saka and bad fixtures when palmer has good fixtures no i probably want to go back to palmer like the way that season has shaped so far is like theres one mustone and his names holland and then like between mo saka palmer maybe even sun well see were going to rotate like its hard to say now its only been five game four games but it seems like were going to rotate these guys based on fixtures which seems right to me right now but i wouldnt be worried with him like you said never a bad pick has all the avenues one of three players who ticks every box hes gonna get pen theyre not gonna get no pens and the one nice thing too with him compared to the other premium assets is hes not even in the europe squad so while they play its going its going to affect their preparation and the cohesiveness and the rhythm of the squad because he plays four new player every game is ridiculous but this international break players injured thats fine but it just it does feel that way that it will be disjointed throughout the season but for palmer hes going to play 90 every game in the league so thats also a huge boon to his value which we cant say about even mo we cant say that about everyone none of the pre premiums well i assume spurs are not in europe right theyre in something arent they are they i dont even know man let me are they in conference league or whatever i think so europa league europa league all right so they have thursday carag so even son i dont know maybe hell rest them but well we teased the captaincy i me we havent individually talked about liverpool or villa yet but we could start with cap and then go to either one of them but big daddy said toala still the best captain this week or weve seen enough against forest to second guess aie is there anyone you like for captain at all if you dont have mo and then benett jitterbug also discussing mo versus oyap all the same its hard to answer this before the midweeks because like what would you need to see well like what would change your mind do you think because for me i dont think the midweeks matter that much play mo doesnt play allie plays doesnt so worst case is like ali starts mo doesnt start mm then what oe its like they both play on tuesday like they both have like ample time off before the game like i just dont think it matters ali this maybe is going to be a recurring thing with him his slow starts he missed every chance imaginable in the first three games then he blows up with 13p pointer maybe hes going to be good for the rest of the season like he was last season but we know his fitness is like once hes fit hes a beast like ive never seen him not sprinting so im not that worried about that i wonder what was bothering him there was an emory thing that said like he came back with like a little niggle but what niggle would one have that they would still start and play an hour like what is that its so confusing could be anything it could be his should like i it could be anything just little pain here like whatever its it would be it doesnt matter than midweek its to me it is definitely oi because bournemouth are legitimately a good team and wolves are a joke like i think wolves are second to sorry southampton to best attacking fixture in the league based on how theyre playing this year thats just how i see it thats how ive seen them play all season and they dont have the personnel to do anything different like they cant park a bus they have such bad defenders and they have no midfield like mario lamina i dont even know if hes a defensive midfield i dont know what he is but they just dont have any like no i love him but im just saying they dont have like dms to play like he seems like hes just doing this thing and hes going to be doing it all year no matter what and theyre just so open theyre just so open am i crazy or like were they not playing three at the back for like large majority of last season and just got three dudes in there who headed out they played like at least by fb ref which isnt perfect they from november on played three at the back in every game thats when they were playing three at the with like eight nor was playing wing like those games and but this year theyre just playing for the back just expensive thats going to be good neither of them can do anything theyre bad tomato and anori defensively are not good well tomatos pretty good defensively i think but fast but no thats what im saying its just theyre just playing this open theres so much space on the pitch every game ive seen them play this year and its their i me i think this is like theyre very exploitable i think its a lot the gambling people were on them as like theyre the team that could get dragged into a relegation race like there were good odds on them like they compared to the odds because everyone just has all the promoted sides straight back down i wish they had saw in that i will say that but saw potenti for sure and johnson stole some points from me as a eso gordon owner there was like a eso played murphy and clean through johnson save there were a couple other like could got something there so hell do that but im born with are just good mo i think i think the fixture is not close enough which is also aggravating because i dont if i didnt go the main reason why i wanted to get mo on wild card was for this week and im like ah just whatever its fine thats f thats what thats why i have those stats like ready to go for bournemouth because i watched the match and then like today i watch highlights of all the matches and whatever and i was just like dude what and then i was trying to just like put numbers to it i was like what are they like doing like why is this working highlights will never show you any of this but they just they just break everything up they just are a pest and ariel good they also just have so many high energy like chrisy like all of their guys just run an insane amount taver seeno they all fullback also never go forward they challenge you and stick to you and valou you and then they just go long thats the other thing when they attack theyre not southampton theres no opportunity to like win the ball and get a chance they just go long to their huge guys to s meno he win every du its just like go deal with him off its nowhere near our goal ever the one other i we also didnt know sancho looked unbelievable there could be something there could there could be something there look netto good player doesnt fit what they do at all i so i dont know what how thats going to end its not going to go well for him is how im imagining plan of this team everyone knows is ridiculous there is no plan buto might just be banished already like i would not be surprised enzo said like he doesnt care about the other guys he likes keeping a small team like it might just be or he just plays on thursday i just mean like from prem but sancho is interesting especially from a palmer standpoint where he just never wants to shoot all he wants to do is facilitate so i like that i like that he could potentially take a step forward and get in the team well s is the same which is weird and funny right its just like you get saner the ball let him dribble a little bit hell create he also doesnt cu youre saying thats what palmers like too i feel like palmer likes to shoot though he shoots he likes to shoot but maybe hes insted not to sancho keep an eye on him man utd could use him they could they should buy someone like thatd be good so olly more questions about olly and just other forwards i just group these all together people with c and isach do we kneejerk to mata and oly or play it cool bolter said in previous seasons i would punt on oli transfer sock out even though im wild carding in six which is something we talked about on the last sp of just like the interesting decision that we have now with the five transfers and rolling the freeze i we can just start there the other ones are about other forwards where do you see that like using a free lets just say use bol as example use a free es to ali even though im wild carding and get in6 so youre like burning a free for one punt one weak punt but youre going to wild card and have one or two or three free well its not a onewe punt its a two we punt because youre captaining him so you get double so i think i like that thinking i like that thinking i would definitely do that definitely cap bali bring him in for sure any other thing you tell me i would not say sign off on that one we move but what this is like touching on both of our team where are you at with eso and also not having ali like how do you see this cookie crumbling or it just feels ridiculously stupid to not have olli right now is it just for this week cuz its wolves and the holland thing or is it just like for the next its wolves ip switch its like the next two and that was i had like a plan at some point that like im gonna get oli but i got scared off it because he played 60 minutes every game and was missing every chance he finally came good so good for everyone who has but if isach wasnt hur lets just say newcastle still win that game isach probably gets a return if hes on the pitch i would probably just suck it up and just be like ah just going to stick with it hold my free like its sets me up better long term but with eso hurt probably can cuss im no doctor but again the vision blurry thing is a little concerning it seems worth it does it matter to how many freeze the persons on because i do think thats a factor you have three or one or whatever because if you have one and you make this one move and you wild card then youre just going to have one after wild card and you better have done a lot of your picks right cuz if not like thats a little youre in the normal season like scary i think in terms of doing the move it doesnt matter cuz i think having oi captain compared to mo or anybody else is enough of a edge i think where it comes around is how aggressively can you plan your transfers with your wild card if you have one versus three or four right because like were going into this the bad city and arsenal so how many of them do you have to stash like probably more so you might have to go a little thin on the edges on your wild card and or wait no cuz if youre doing it now you dont have it for this week right no its for this week g in six we have wild card up so i dont think it matter im mixed up im thinking if youre doing it now youre good i dont think it matters i think because when you do it in six youre getting the arsenal players youre doing the things like its easier to make a six team than it is to make a five team but the only part that makes it weird and its hard to talk about specific teams because everyones in a different situation but like with andy on our live stream right it came down to like dude you should just rip wild card on the last day of an intern naal break to save your transfers which is where i am and the fact that i might have to wild card is like if i dont get any ja pedro update no eso update theyre both fraudulent managers who arent going to say anything anyway but im sitting here with a team with like two maybe not players nico who might not start barcos not the league soar i could use my two freeze right i could like double change get alli cap oy whatever but then im on no freeze versus i could just wildc card have two frees afterwards and im in probably a better spot yep so i dont know i dont know what people should do with that information its like maybe if you can just use one you do it but if its more wild card early its the contextual nature matters here but i think some of the same processing of how should i be looking at this applies its its tough its tough call its an interesting call when were we keep talking about this how much more fun the game is with this rule change just adds so much more complexity and so much more thought behind its not just dead end cuz you lose it or whatever it just makes the game a lot more interesting because this would be in a previous season this would not even be a decision of course use your free before your wild card you have to or you burn it free you just do its like almost a m youre automaton so what about dcl great p ever since we declared the error hes come back with the vengeance with his bullet 12 last two all i was saying on lr pot is dcs a pick mcneels a pick look at that hall i cant believe they went up two again and blew it again though cant you absolute house team but i think theyre picks theyre still picks mcneils 54 ds 59 hard to find guys in that price range who are better look we talk about d celia pens and why is mcneel a pick just run this through again for me because hes never been a pick since hes been in the league which has been for seven years i think its just more a long run of good pictures and mcneel is this rare weird who theres probably others in the league maybe like kevin falls into this category but probably not because of like doku and b and whatever but if theres a chance hes assisting it he creates every chance imaginable for their team and theres theres just not its like the talisman but for assists because all their chances are like get the ball to mcneel cross set piece mcneel cross free kick mcne cross and he sometimes shoots and scores world e and whatever but like its just are they going to score goals are everton going to be fine i still think theyre gna be completely fine once they get guys fit so do i dice just too good and like so i still theyre going to score goal they just scored two against villa theyre going to score goals in this run of easy fixtures and hes gonna rack on the assist in this stretch thats it and hes 54 its its just free real estate sisers bournemouth who we just aformentioned best team in the league bournemouth we just talked about and then he halls as for villa easy and now he has a whats the run atlas or home palace home at ep home fham at south at west home brenford at m united home wolves before ar its insane im sure theyre knocked out of every cup already it they dont they dont have a lot of other things to focus mcneil they dont even have the luxury of focusing on anything else because theyll get relegated if they do they have to win games so go back over to dcl where is dcl le frogging ladro here cuz he is to me a million times yes is not even plan the run is not even its night and day hes a legit good pick the problem is we only have three forward slots and theres him theres kai theres ali theres holland theres dom theres theres other guys who will emerge too but he is a good pick i think that like i havent played with the wild card team for now but like theres a good chance yet but theres a good chance that like if i need an enabler 59 good nail 90 every game depends the only thing he cant do is being a oneonone but thats okay well get well get over that could be i dont know other forwards though people are asking aie said what are your thoughts on kai after this next game we easy hold or do we try and get saka instead and mish said is it dom time salani time again lot of forward action im uninterested in salanki should we talk about spurs arsenal now sure theyre theyre doing the same thing that they did last year and its just nothings changed and he just showed up so they have thursday they have a pretty good run of fixtures but its a good time for them if i if i were a wild card now its like i could they have one bad fixture until christmas at city in november 20 third gaming 12 every other fixture is pretty its a crazy run its a kind it is a crazy run but i think the p like this is similar to e its like the pens are just such a huge deal to look at him well i just feel like im operating under the assumption that the captain and player who has not missed pens for them over the last couple years will take pens still and its son i agree hes probably like one of their highest ever goal scorers also like hes the guy me operating under this pretext that hes not on pens its just i dont see him beating out these other players that were mentioning for a spot like i just dont see how hes shouldering past any of them in the pecking order if he had pens i think hed be in hed be in hed be in the top three but as it stands i think hes just on the outside looking in and it is its interest im like so sun just cooks my head so much all the time cuz ive had such an up and down relationship with him fpl wise over the years like some years its amazing and some years its awful and i was pretty like out on him at the end of last year just like this player is not good anymore and still i look at the run and i just think like hes playing he a couple braces right like thats all it is its like hes going to blank and then he just pops up with a brace and its like son classic 10 isnt a good price and the brace had against everton was very fortuitous i think it was pretty lucky but and then hes been invisible for the other three games and hes going to play as long as hes fit hes starting every hes just going to keep starting they dont have the team is like its his team so im im a little bit interested in sun i dont know if i would pull the trigger and put him in my team but he thats like a wild card pick potentially not like someone youre necessarily transferring right it feels like you use your transfer on like higher impact like people want mo this week people want saka next week or oli this week whatever like guys you might captain and stuff oli sun just feels like if i wild card i could find a way that hes in my team and like i feel like no one has him like theres no way any has him youd have to be insane to have him hes he looks like a terrible pick hes been playing badly and like the team is per owned and theres millions of koreans in the world so you have to factor that in hes negative per owned if you fact that they dont all look the same though as his teammate will bon core who played through it with the cor he played through that a difficult take of his but jesus christ spurs ah man they are so frustrating to watch and theyre just like theyre southampton on steroids like theyre just like were going to dominate the game but also never create a good chance ever like i was i was talk i think i was at the end of last stream i was talking with jack lad about bruno and how there was that one did you listen to the anfield rap when neil did the solo show the trends he was by himself i dont think ive ever heard it was that like this week it was a couple weeks ago okay definitely didnt hear that then so it was like a solo show was just him talking it was like a half an hour and he went app like he left his body talking about man united and bruno not bruno just talking about man united and just how long theyve been so b like how bad theyve been for how long not only based on like the public perception but also just the numbers like how bad theyve been genuinely how bad theyve been and it got me thinking i always listen with the fpl lens on about bruno just like hes 85 and hes bad like if bumo was 85 wed be wed be like like okay like its i would still immediately get him but like its just like thinking about where is bruno at compared to the other midfielders like hes not 85 he should be he should be seven like he should be the same price as buo like their attack is the same as brenham and he doesnt even play striker hes living off this previous reputation of his first year or two under ol and where they were attacking out of control they got a couple extra pens than they typically do and like he banged in these huge years but but its similar to me thinking about spurs where its like why is there all this price inflation on a team that to me when i watch them just feels mid like their attack looks midt like it looks just as good as all the midt teams it doesnt look top four it doesnt look top six like why would i spend 10m on anyone on their team like they dont perform to that level at all and like its back with sun is like living on previous reputation i know he just had 200 points last year but i think theres a lot of m striker though thats a different yes double dig of his goals were at striker and play striker no other comps like a lot over as xg as he normally does you still have to mention that and so i just look at this team and im like theres so many more reasons why i against son than for him and but i still like a moth to flame im like son like same honestly if man united had nine good fixtures in a row i would be the i would also in a world where im like maybe wild card id be like maybe i just hold bruno for nine and hope he gets two pens and two assists and one open play goal and im like thats good that would be amazing if you got thats too bad they already played southampton so they got their free win out of the way but all that to say that game was just like i dont know what game it was a noname nothing happened arsenal were very happy with nothing happening and then saka one of three players who takes every box ticked one of his boxes and gets a assist he scored a corner im starting to get a little bit i know that with arsenal were looking at them having some injuries so things are a little bit difficult there but missing a lot they played four games theyve scored six goals not a lot of goals im starting to look back at is this just going to be the most conservative pep team weve ever seen and they set out to keep it nil as long as possible thinking theyre going to just fall into the off the set piece or thea moment of brilliance because they dont commit men they dont gamble they dont do much of anything they just stay in control and command and should we be like were looking at like kai saka like home ler home southampton do you think its been because its been the start of the season this little first three game we thing and then injuries and theyre going to score five and six sometimes or is this going to be they play every three games hard to say the schedules been hard hard home wolves they were not great but they scored two and just killed the game a away villa they were bad and scored two goals and killed the game brighton they piled on the most attack ive seen from them all season i feel like they created like many good chances even in the first half at 11v 11 and then down to man they kept racking up even more chances on the break with ken saka so that was almost the most encouraging attacking performance but then no rice no ode but also i think like and this is like a larger point that i had in my notes is just like everyone played bad after the international break every team that was favored by a goal or more you either lost that bet or push that bet they all city could have been down 30 they come back and win 21 on weird goals liverpool lose to forest palace were one of them they 22 bright were one of them they nil they lost nil villa are the only one that pushed every other bet lost villa were down two nil and theyre the only one that pushed well man united but but they were not they were not favored by that much because theyre united and they also could have been down one nil and that should have been down one n everyone just came back sleepy and theyre missing rice and theyre missing odard i dont know i feel like it was almost just him being like well first of all like this is maybe practice for etad like we just need to sit on it take our chances play smart play control nil prepare for the nil but then also i just think home luster home southampton its like they cant not score i just think theyre going to be parked in the attacking third the entire game in both of those thats fair but its not been encouraging and we havent even talked about liverpool lose one nil dont even reach one xg at home another just like flat performance of all these teams after the international break and its just like what do you do i grouped newcastle and liverpool separately from the others because both of them were liverpools the best attack in the league last year newcastle were fifth best by the numbers last year they both like liverpool gets zero goals newcastle somehow get two goals right its like a sh worldy deflection barnes worldy they had a couple other chances but it what didnt feel like a two goal game and yet im like they had like liverpool specifically they were just in the final third the whole game all day in transition whole game huge chance missplay pass huge cutback chance missplay pass so its hard to quantify it because its like either you believe nfo is not this good in their defense isnt this good or you believe liverpool arent that good and the first three games were like an anomaly or what am i led to believe here i think liverpool we both think theyll be on track theyll be fine it was a weird bad game newcastle have been weird bad start to the season but again like space everywhere all the time just missing on the execution post missing things and its it was a bad day in the office for liverpool and bad days in the office typically happen when youre away from your colleagues for two weeks and youre working another job with new colleagues for two weeks its like thats what it is its up and all of the things can be true right nfl could have played well and gotten a little lucky a little rub of the green and limited the things and but i think the infrastructure and the way liverpool have looked the first three give us a little bit more than just thinking that theres something broken here im not there with newcastle though i think its more of like im still panicking about them i think that they look i was we were i think you were off but in discord just look like theyre fourth place theyve been probably the worst team in every single of their four games they played actual like they were definitely in the first one down to 10 men definitely i thought they were i thought they were better they had some counter dominated in the way that to do they did the thing and but like wolves could have beaten them 40 and i would been like thats what i watched i didnt watch that match and i was i was stunned when i looked at the numbers and watch the highlights cuz you were texting me like wolves had a million chances could have been 40 but like in the numbers and the highlights it just was not bad they had like they had the one tap in that was great and other than that it was like just a couple like mid tier chances so surpris what you were seeing you need to watch it like i dont know the numbers are the numbers but there were so many times where there was like a good move where there was some type of lopsided situation going on and then one of their bad players which is like nine of them like did something stupid or strand whatever it is but by and large like they were just winning every oneonone like it was just are just lets go one on lets go one verse one everywhere on the pitch and they just beat them everywhere on the pitch pretty much the whole game you dont need to talk me out of newcastle defense ive been so selling on them for like six months and i feel like this game just like reemphasize that point but where its hard with newcastle attack again its like i feel like im like making excuses for their attack every week but its also not wrong right its like gorans still creating chances still hitting the post still look ey test good esos like creating some chances bub gets concussed okay like me bad luck or whatever they created some big chances late in the game when it was even more open tanali and barnes had big chances and i think the manager is terrible been on that record for years and hes just playing long staff they have a couple of players that are so they have a couple of players that are completely incompetent that ruin everything and like even to the point where i look at the defense and im like why the actual his trips not starting again like we couldnt sell him the turkey like comes in for 30 minutes creates chances go back to the thing that worked like put all the tall guys in the back three and let him play wing and do that and the field and you love to talk about a stench we have not mentioned this eddie how and the tind director of football not tindle do about that they like dont they dont they like weeks like the whatever is it mitchell or some like hes like the transfers have all been bad and then eddie has to like come out to the press and defend the play i like all the players we brought in its like what the is going on they need the evil robot saudi woman well shes gone i know that they need it there is it doesnt sound or smell good and and its also right hes this is what the criticism ive had of edward for years is like he picks the worst players like he picks the worst possible team with the squad he has available almost all the time he finally starts playing barnes and then he drops him and then he start starts playing hall and then he has to drop hall for kelly puts i cant play barnes and hall i cant play barnes and hall its just so stupid like hes so stupid and bad and dumb and he does such dumb every week i cannot handle the person and the teams a mess theyve won three and drawn one and yet it still feels like hes on the ropes cuz mitchells mitchells got a hard on to get rid of them he cant wait to fire him hell fire him the first notice he gets that hes allowed to fire him hes going a fire him i know and i know i think they need to fire him how far are they going with theyve already hit the heights with edward it was a couple years ago theres no upside here like this is they could i did forget to bring this up when you were talking about spurs and how theyre just like midtable i was thinking about it earlier i was like whos the fourth best team cuz i think that is very not obvious cuz it could be spurs could be chelsea could be newcastle could be villa are there i think i think villa i think its villa theyre okay im not like buying stock and them finishing fourth at all i would i would buy bright no thats come on thats insane i would buy i think its crazy i would buy the villa stock i think chelsea are also reasonable just because of the she the sheer quality of players that they have at every position is like you and i could comanage like edward tindall style and i think we would do pretty well with chelsea we do pretty well with this chelsea squad like its just they have 100 play 100 pound players and 50m pound player backups at like every spot onam play mostly well the win against bournemouth was scam but like they beat the out of palace which ended 11 and they scored six goals against wolves and they played okay against city for enzzos first match they played fine the thing with villa look europe could destroy them i do hope that that eings is able to manage the squad and players like barkley and are going to be advantageous for them in that regard bia andan and i just the biggest thing with me for them is duran like having another striker that can clearly score goals is something that all of these teams in the fourth place conversation that were discussing dont have and you can make maybe the ar spurs but chelsea and maybe spurs to some extent with rich but hes never available so i dont know if that even counts not the argument for spurs would be like its dom and then move sua striker is like the backup chelsea have goal scores and and so do villa villa also has the winner this week in cuckoo he subs on subs on he looks great and they have a lot of depth there its its more of like thats a basket case with a lot of new going on so how is that going to go consistently but phil its just like a lot of steady stable with a couple of tweaks around the edges in the in the periphery with a couple like rogers coming into the fold and the defense well see how the defense settles when they get mings back diego carlos back like all of a sudden youre looking and like okay like they could they could they could fight two they could fight on two front so ifting them off but im just saying like to me theyre just another team in the group its not clearly im totally with you the group is theres a few teams and like if i was betting i would bet on villa i do wonder what the betting ons are i have no idea but lets i think we have can just throw a rogue thing in there i still think that theres something with west ham this year like i just think theres something there they win the late the late point iny i just i feel like lope tegui like after a couple months is gone the first 11 is as good as any team in the league like talk about fourth place that first 11 can finish in fourth place im im very certain of that with pack and fullest krw kudus bowen well full krw has to play before he has to like not go to germany again alvarez somerville like they have too when he start kilman like 1b they have theyre theyre good i think theyre going to be good theyve been pretty bad so far but theyve had difficult fixtures it wouldnt surprise me when theyre playing once a week and everyones back and he can ride them and get them into the patterns of play that he wants that they could go on a big run and be a tough out for the top teams like i agree with the tough out part its its just hard when theyre sitting here with one win one draw two losses already theyre going to have to le teams no youre thats fair thats it would it would take a lot but i feel like theyre one of the more theyre one of the more roger teams i just i like that i like the way the squad look so well see and bournemouth i like too i dont think theyre fourth but like theyre going to cause a lot of problems c cver on pens now pick is he definitely because ev so bad at pens should be tav is also like two for two in his career tav but it was the same as glasner but he said he was like its the two of them so they chose and they picked they rolled the wrong choice i should have that also is insane to me that managers dont set that initially like theyre too py theyre so to say its you and not you because they want to like massage both of them like its a democracy on the field when theyre emotional and football thing that we will never understand there is american sport in a flagrant foul and its like you five decide who takes the free throw inad of feeling that its like no our best free throw ridiculous hes the only one that ever takes it and everyone knows its insane and if hes not in the pitch its this guy this guy this guy this guy in that order its crazy its its bizarre were jumping around theres one more topic i want to touch on and then get to questions and everything else will just move until friday my life thursday pod but so wia is just out for months shots my guy heyo benj said is shot straight in with a whist out for months i love the match up for spurs in the river of green pictures seems great x50 with wia and thiago out and bredford having great running fixures is shot a pick am i crazy or is shota just like an incredible pick how does he stack up against your other incredible pick friend mcneel theyre the two best picks in the game no if shota is the striker hes the better pick strike striker hes playing up top with bumo up top well its not that obvious though because i was thinking about it earlier you think it could be kp and car and car or what carvalo it could be carvalo you think it could be car well theyre going to play three all look all these fixtures the spurs is a little bit but from that they have a run where theyre playing three forward so its between it seems like when they play a back three which is not relevant but im just talking it out loud but be for this weekend it will be for this weekend when they play it back three it seems like kp is left wing back wing back and then they play two forwards and so we think itll be shaab bumo but it could be carvalo buma and then in games where theyre favored whatever theres three i dont know i just think that the two with carve wont work hes just not an outlet like how is he going to be in the game if its just him and bumo the thing hes a weird player and i havent watched him that much because hes always been on loan but i do know he scored nine goals at whole last year he b he played forward in like half the games he wasnt playing like hes not a wide man hes like a number 10 or a nine and a half weiro so like if youre going to ask me let me put it this way if both of them get 2000 forward minutes like that who scores more goals i think its carvalo for sure score goals better and like hell assist more and hell win pens and hes just good but like i dont know it depends what he values i think no im im with you on shot i think hes a good pick i do think that hes going to be ahead of car on the packing order me too that would both this weekend and moving forward i feel like its going to be more like carve and kp maybe fight and like damgard they just dont have they dont have any dard anymore no i know well he plays them periodically but they just dont have anybody so youre looking at bumo sha and carve like when they play three up thats what it has to be and hell probably play kp at or hes just not going to play in those games or maybe its also kp cuz he doesnt want to play so love sh dude i was shouting shot in preseason like 5 five hes and i was saying like it will take multiple injuries for that to be a thing and here we are multiple injuries multiple in i think like he played so few top level minutes but in those minutes hes does good so and its its difficult because him and mcneel both have a very similar very long very good run and you look if youre on wild card you could build a team with both no problem and put money elsewhere you could do some funky because theres and were not even talking about seeno but all of a sudden you sorry had the assist i dont think hes a pick but all of a sudden were looking at like multiple sub six million midfielders that look good so you could dude an esr under the radar i know he gets subbed every game but hes been huge for me points in four weeks the assist was just everything and the goal sick assist and he gets he gets a bone and then the 10 pointer in the other game i cant ask for more no and he could also just be someone that you just hold forever like hes just going to be doing this like all year and just trickling in with points and the t just like weve talked about f every year with mil is like they play to the level of their opposition theyre fine theyre always going to be fine theyre always going to finish in 12th or whatever listen if im if i wild guard hes probably not making the team he not hes not jumping these other guys but its at least another name in that price bracket that if you set your team up in this way youve got seeno esr shota dwight these are four guys that are under six that if you build your team and rogers we havent even mentioned who just i dont even own him and im still offended by what happened fine i own him starting every week i think i was just rooting for you so hard that it was just too disgusting to even like comment on like there are so many guys in this price bracket that maybe that is the best way to build the team cuz where there are not players are in the price bracket between six and seven and a half or six and like 10 honestly like theres not that many kai aside if were just talking about like midfielders well hes a forward but hes a forward so im saying like forget about him theres like kev and foden which are just like i dont know theyre going to get some points but like i dont know then theres bruno odard diaz jota who are now both rotation ris both getting subbed early mat bowens pick shout out to bowen shout out to walshs bowen not a three returns of four good gordon theres very few guys e gets a downgrade marnelli is bad rashford ra maybe razzle emerges the best pick in the actual i was also looking at kevin how insane it is that hes played n 90 minutes all year and hes at two returns its just impossible hes he is a pick in game week seven if or like even game week six wild cards i think that theres a possibility that like you have holland saka and kev like can that be a team like i think i think it can be a team like when is he cant play 4000 minutes though like is he just gonna is he gonna him because hes leaving all i know is hes fit now and hes playing now and hes still the second best player on the team and i dont know they need to win some game so i dont know this pod could easily go on for another two hours is what im sensing so lets jump to questions bang some out move on we you also have fantasy champions league you have to navigate im good i have my teams set benett ben has any fuckle fantasy champions league shouts i dont have any i dont even know lot of shot like who are the i dont have my team open whos the best pick in the game in that game let me open my team there are 15 of them and theyre all on my team let put it that way theres too many i opened the thing theres too many teams im not participating in this i will very happily enjoy it from afar this is going to take my computer 10 minutes open so ccle back well we just talked about all these glue guys but big dunks and jaia are asking us to like rank the glue guys seeno mcneil esr rogers boomo bone i dont think bumo and bone qualify for glue necessarily do they bumo does so i bumo is the best of all of them for sure seeno just keeps putting up numbers and theyre theyre at anfield this week but then its home they just have such mixed fixtures dont want to play them this week dont want to play them in eight dont want to play them in 10 which is annoying and hard to navigate but if youre wild card you can navigate that the issue with seeno is as good as he looks every game i watch him is just the he has no avenues like his literal only aven is open play and when youre looking at the picks around the game its hard for that to trump players that have more than just the singular avenue and its not like bournemouth have been good but its not like they create a million chances and theyre so attacking its like not the case at all thats been the case it could change when they have better fixtures and they dont have better fixtures for a while so were looking at the next five six they have the southampton leer game and they have bad fixtures in and around those theyre good fixture run starts in game m 11 where they have a wide birth but i think its interesting like seeno to shot for example and shot is going to be playing forward so seeno plays forward like a little bit more wind and a little bit wider those are those are close calls so id rather have shot its its also the fixtures matter like maybe you want shot for the next five or six and then you get seeno but i might with seeno is he has to have good fixtures like youre not playing this in bad fixtures and that is the same for all of these five5 mids like all of them seo mcneil esr rogers shota if they have bad fixtures you dont want to play them mean the main difference where its like jiao pedros interesting or dcl is interesting is that doesnt matter because they have pens they have pens so where youre putting your five picks with its mid or the third forward or what all of this adds up to which one fits best in your team just to look at it in those ways right totally agree all right i got my fuckle team up okay back to fuckle what are we looking at here so we got few mill in the bank because we dont need that much money in this game no big deals i dont know i love hearing about it then we have tan and d gregorio in goal hes the uve goalie classic defense is chan my god a legend i love beston so much cambiaso whos some uve defender whos like forward and cambiaso classic cen cambiaso a classic hakeim is in there love them of course pongs in there love him midfield we have pulik american has to have american representation raph in easy in wartz didnt have him in europe euros so we put him in here m cuz its my god m alis cuz well how could i not have alis that was the first name i put in my team by easily captain and then the easy captain i knew i know you i know my dude thats the first thing thats the first thing its like and they play the first time why you play its like just to be able to do that and then ive got fahashi up top celtic genius okay gores he scores a million goals right for aashi hell keep it up korus on sporting forward okay genius that guy is everyone talking about that guy and then adm benfica back to his roots its because youre watching the documentary you got d maria thats right love that love it great team those are they answer the question previous those are all the best picks in the game josh b said keeper talk is ria worth a free transfer if i hendo lets compare their points and see how thats played out so far rya got more points this week than hendo has had all year combined rys on 29 and hendos on eight and if we do the math from earlier where youre third 12 points higher than me and youre 350000 places higher than me okay let me do a little math here i think id be like top 5k if i had goalkeeper matters a lot well especially if what you were talking about in discord is true and riot just keeps farming bones on every clean because theyre going to keep a lot of cleans especially when they play like that so far so true he kept more saves than he typically would but even i think even if he had a couple less saves i think he still would have been clear of let me have a look over here what are we doing he was still eight ahead of saka he could have had two or three less saves and still been in two or one bonus look the next closest bps was white on 23 and rya got 33 thats a huge gap five saves is a lot say he made save is worth two bps so if he made two or three its only six or eight less hes still hes still pretty comfortably clear and on bones over the defenders youba cba got a card so he would have been up to 25 if he didnt its getting closer but again its back to it just its close and when you get it he gets two more dude hes ridiculous like its ridiculous i think like people who wild card this week people who wild card next week it just seems like everyone is just waiting to wild card to like make that move and if you can make the move without having to wild card thats even better but this everyone that was wild carding this week didnt get him because the city i dont know they got for buan or they listen to me lrod we were saying like hes the only guy to get we dont get any of the defenders get him me too i weve been saying this for the whole last two weeks but rya dude its just its so painfully obvious and its like who was that im sorry to call out friends from discord but who is the absolute savage psycho who wildcarded into hendo keeper remember that moment this weekend hes like who can i get the actual worst pick in his position this is my guy for the next 20 weeks that guy needs to re wild he got hacked email official f you got hacked and hes just using a transfer there but rya its just so obvious its just free real estate guy said four weeks in i still feel like we dont have a strong sense of which teams are good outside the usual suspects filla and newcastle are up in the top five but feel unconvincing is its still too early to know we talked about that already and were going to start looking at a whole new game now that europes starting were gna have to start taking close notes on how managers are rotating and how theyre using their squad so well see there i also i wanted to ask you also about rico cuz got the halftime sub that was x50 is next thing he said its it time to start panicking about rico like youre youre not onlooker how do you see this with him arsenal next europe starting kyle played you still just start him every week i think halftime sub is very unp to me and that its it was also warranted because that game was completely out of control and they were lucky to not be down 20 or 30 as pep also said in the in the postmatch so i think it was just a weird situation theyre still integrating roger back in and as soon as rogery came back in the game was over so i still think like any time rico starts hes the best four five you have he should start and in games when he doesnt start youre just praying he stays on the bench i still think the same rules apply especially now that rs back im with you thats how i was looking at it people were pretty frantic and panicking about it theres nothing like its just i dont know theres so many complications to fpl but if everyone was flying this week everyone in discord was flying this week and that happened to rico they would just be like love rico whatever it matter wont happen all the disasters its just like and rico like i have to know just relax the concern with rico is he starts midweek which that would be bad for but also i dont even know if it would be bad for him well i think because say it is but then but no i understand but then you look at that and you think okay well that means hes playing three center backs and kyle against arsenal prob play i dont think hell play versus arsenal which also as youve said is not bad thats fine even though thats probably going to be a nil so like do you should i start him or well talk about it after the midweeks well talk about it after the midweeks but it would be nice i think to figure it out now before we get biased from the midweeks to me what are other options well i have po just chilling po wolves too its i i dont know about but to me i imagine that ricos going to start midweek and not start against arsenal like thats how this going that would be logical but i just think pep is like very illogical and sometimes he does stuff that we dont think about so its not even worth trying to think about it i dont think that like this means that i think its much more complex than that so its just if i have him i need to just dont even think or look at if hes fit just start him i think so okay if hes not fit you can just him too hell still get autoed fine with that im fine with that i think thats where i come down okay lets see i dont know we could probably push all these i think to well theres a couple lifestyle ones maybe we do those and then wrap it up and push everything else to thursday sounds good fl doom said why do you support your specific new york teams why mets not yankees why jets and giants and not giants jets family reasons geographical reasons or other reasons you start off with this one i can start my dad is from brooklyn and was a huge brooklyn dodgers fan aka yankees enemy number one he despises everything to do with the yankees and i was raised that way and i also despise them and why jets i think its just my brothers its just like the team that we always rooted for i dont even there was no point in my life when i decided it was just like im a jet fan i dont know so thats it it was more it was more circuitous for me because my parents didnt watch sports or know anything about sports their whole lives so my moms from queens and like thats whatever but for me it was more just like my friends and it took me like a few different teams to get to like any of to the mets like i was like i like this team or that team or i like i like allen iverson so like that team but like i think as i got older into like more middle school age and i half my friends are giants fans half for jets fans half for mets fans half for yankees fans i just got to like pick the ones that resonated more with me at the time and for me it just fell into mets and giants so thats how it went for me thats how it is i will say as a jets fan still one of the alltime great sports moments i think in both of our lives was at youre visiting me with a bunch of other friends at marty were all blacked out insanity i didnt black out until after we no until after what just trying to represent the chaos around us and then giants beat the in the super bowl outside insane and then the other lifestyle question is mc marman he said does your love of fpl in sports general ever create friction with your partner or is it just me wow well youre newly partnered how are you doing over there with shars theres a little friction here and there not gonna lie ngls not going to lie when it comes to footy its easier for two reasons one i its my job and so im like i got to watch this shout out to fml hey its an income source and the other reason is its early not as early as it is on the west coast but its like i can reason be like ill be done by noon some week some days ill be done by two some days whatever and we can still do during the day do at night when it comes to nfl though its a hard its like when i was single same with you when youre single you cant do the 1 pm to 1100 pm im watching football that is not acceptable so you just got to suck it up and thats just not reality anymore if youre an a real intense sports fan like we are it is in inevitably fr frictitious fractious has to be with your wife its just it has to be because its all you want to do and they dont give a about its like they could not care they could not give a they couldnt tell you one player and one league thing so but its you and i have that little cheat card where its like were making money on this so we have to in air quotes have to do it which is partially true but also we could we could get by watching games in other times and this and that but its fun to watch it live and we look forward to it so we want to do it but exactly its all bargaining like its all about whats reasonable what are my responsibilities i have a kid you dont like so that changes things and you have to look at the equation and prioritize like if i were single the amount of sports i watch would probably be 400 more than what i if not higher than what i watch now when you factor in baseball its every night when hours every night when laurens not here all i do is sports are on all the time its not its not ever off like people have hobbies like they go play golf like i just like watching sports like thats all i want to do like im happy so happy to watch sports like i could do it every day all day i just love watching sports and thinking about it and all the things so like when laurens not here for a couple days like i have dam so thats a bit like i just i would just watch sports like i would just watch sports nonstop and the one edge i have and its i have to pat myself on the back here because im good at getting people into and sharon is just in on nfl she just loves the drama of football loves watching loves like the pace of it she couldnt give a about baseball unless were there soccer whatever loves nfl so theres we do some errands we do some stuff on sundays but then its like all right well im gonna come back put the game on shes like put it on put it on im like yes im gonna sit here for the next eight hours hopefully thats how it goes thats how it goes but you have like you cant like watch sports over your relationship thats insane so you just have to mature and figure out like you have to mature and realize whats important or start a podcast and start earning money and both exactly s of i think the biggest cheat code would be if you had a successful gambling podcast because then you could spend anything is like no i got it i gotta watch i put 20k on this is a huge match for the blah but you already put 20k so does it matter if you watched it it matters so much i got to talk about it i have got the guy on tuesday all right well push all the other questions i think to thursday let me slap asses we havent ped in a while so we got some asses we got max mure taylor hyde ben eva rory button william peek benny the potato king stanley ipus james sia andrew quter arie magnuson scalpin macklin oneal dan baby get in you thank you for all your new signups stanley ipkiss thats from a movie it doesnt sound real its

captain SE on four son two isak one off at half time of course so a lot of teams were popped up by Harland um I don't have Harland so I couldn't be popped up by that Salah blanked for the first time this season so what are you going to get when harand returns and Salah blanks and you haven't got Harland you're going to get a bad game week um luckily you know sacka and reyer came in for me I yeah I know I mean and there were a lot of teams who had like the 26 points from Harland and then blanks everywhere else wasn't there um there were some crazy looking teams this week in that respect and yeah why why did so many players blank it was just it was just a very very odd game week in that respect and obviously Harland papered over the cracks for a lot of managers I watched the forest Liverpool game live don't ask me how because I wasn't there I did turn down a ticket to go as well this is terrible what would you do in my shoes here so I had a friend who I met at Forest text me on Friday night and he said if I can get you a ticket do you want one and I thought to myself well I'm going to Brighton next week this week and I'm going to Fulham the week after I can't really go into pip and say what do you think can I go to Liverpool and then go next week to the Brighton game and then the week after the full I thought she's not going to let me go to three games and I thought to myself you know what's the chances of us getting some at Liverpool it'd be a good nice to go up there and that I thought no so I DM him back said thanks for the offer but I better not I better do family stuff better not push my luck what happens uh the best away day in the history of I mean like there were people on the forest Focus pod that I do share with saying yeah the best a day in memory and I'm like oh my God so what would you do would you go into pip and look at that look at the sacrifice I made I could have gone but I didn't even ask you cuz that's the kind of guy I am or should I just forget it and leave it or should I bring it up in an argument in a few years time what you Mark I know I know you and I know how much pit puts up with with you I would I would strongly advise you do abs answer I wanted that is I thought I thought I deserve credit for that but I'm getting no credit and I've missed the best away day in Forest history the thing is imagine if You' taken it and got all the way up there and then you got thrash 3-0 yeah but yeah that was the more pretty big gamble it was and as big as going without harand and cin C in the first place anyway yes so um luckily I got through the weekend boyed by the uh the victory at anfield and then it started to sink in as the hours passed that obviously i' had a miserable game week but you know there were teams there were teams worse off than mine um and I've just got to take it but but now I mean what what I'm more down about is the way it's going in the you know we've got Palmer who struggled we've got sackos now got odard missing for probably a long time based on what we heard tonight is that doesn't sound great so we've got to assess is sacka GNA be the sacker of last season now with oard missing for a long period of time probably not we're still G to get him for the two home games but after that you know how long what's the impact of the odard injury on sacka um Watkins has done okay showed up last week so he could be an option but Palmer sacka son I don't see them I don't see them justifying their price at the moment um and I fear I thought sacka would but I wonder now so I'm fear that what we're ending up with even though we started the season going oh there's so much Choice there dilemas and everyone's got different teams I Fe we're going to end up with Salah and Harland in all our teams two Defenders and a load of four FES I do worry I do worry yeah do you not think that's the way it's going to go I'm not as I'm not as worried as about that because I think we're we're seeing in game week six we're going to see people getting rid of Salah um and yeah for the sacker home games yeah and so what you think that in game week eight people are gonna go back to Salah again I don't think I don't know and I think if you've got two Arsenal Defenders and Trent and Harland you're going to find it you know a bit different because we're looking at Players like boo yeah you can't do that yeah as well yeah I don't know I think it's I I I think we are I think game week six is going to be interesting because I think we're going to see people move towards a lot of the same teams I think everyone's team is going to be very similar in game week six and game we seven yeah there's going to be a few people that because I can't I can't have sacka and Salah for example game week six I don't think many can so well you can't your wild card to that you can probably walk to it what a harand sacka Salah and Trent and well you can't have two AR Defenders as well no you can't have two AR Defenders as well no so you'd have to have but you can wild card to saaka Salah Trent and Harland I've tried it I've looked you can I don't think I'm gonna be going with Salah from from game week I'm gonna wild card in either six or seven and I'd be surprised if my team ended up with seller in it so no it won't then but I think what will happen is we'll get sacka in for for the two home games and then we'll start to see that Arsenal perhaps a much more defensive team rather than a Forward Thinking Team without odard and we'll start to think or maybe we don't need sacka maybe we go have it up top and that covers Arsenal I just fear that the options that we yeah we were really giddy about oh yeah this looks amazing harland's 15 million so not everyone's goingon to get him well that's going to go pair shaped and we've got other options like Palmer and sacka and son and and Watkins and and and you can't have them all but I think already I feel like the pool is narrowing a bit what we need what we need is Palmer to start pulling his finger out right that that will that will cure it but I don't know I watched Chelsea and I think um I I don't see it happening do you see it happening yet I mean well I mean on the on the big screen is the is the is the is the fixtures so the long the longterm view so let's assume I mean game week six is going to be split a lot of people won't want to sell Salah for wolves away but some people might have they W I think yeah that might help yeah yeah um and then Liverpool have Crystal Palace Chelsea Arsenal Brighton Aston Villa then it's Southampton in 12 but then it's straight into Man City and then Newcastle away I don't think people are going to be moving back to Salah for that run yeah I mean the only thing um because this is the other thing that's going to be D is if people don't move back to Salah because they just go well I'm only going to captain harand now and that's the I mean how close are we to that I mean after four weeks we're going to look at harand start I mean it's Absolut ridiculous after four weeks how close are we to perac cat in Harland do you think I mean we're not going to get it this week because he's at Arsenal but then I reckon even Newcastle way I think we're going to get people going yeah I'd rather Captain Harland than captain sacka at home um so I think even then we're going to get question marks over do you do you not captain in Harland even when saca's got Plum fixtures so I mean right I me man City's fixures from six and Newcastle Fulham wolf Southampton Bournemouth Brighton Tottenham you're going to cap him in all of those I imagine unless you go for the sacker option at Leicester and Southampton but yeah then you're not and then it's Liverpool away in 13 but that's Salah and Harlem I know I know Arsenal got West Ham away I mean Spurs have got Fulham at home that week so a son or salanki possibly son really I mean I just I I don't know son out wide to me I mean I own him and I you know from what I've seen he obviously got me a couple of goals in game week two but I I don't really see him justifying that P St at the moment we'll see he might surprise us at home to brenford playing out wide but we know out wide he's not as effective as an asset I just think that already I feel because harland's just been ridiculous incredible right and we all thought 15 million was a price tag to make people think well it probably isn't anymore is it it's not I mean like he's 15 what he's three now and no one's going to Blink at that so that's a shame straight away because obviously he's been going to come the dominant heavy hitter and he's going to become the Perma captain and so those two things straight away are going to start narrowing the difference between teams and then yeah it'll be whether or not you feel like having Salah can you justify if you don't Captain him or do you go sacka but I worry about the odard impact on sacka what we need yeah is Palmer and son to kind of show that they can be justified at 10 million and we need foden back to kind of at least present some alternative to Harlem we haven't got that so it's not been I mean fbl did all they could with the pricing don't get me wrong I think they did well with that but unfortunately the way the season has started it hasn't lent itself to everyone having different teams yet I think it's kind of pushing people towards well you've got to have Harland you might as well catch them every week There's question marks over having Sal if you don't Captain him question marks over sacka Palmer's not ready son's not good enough foden's not in the team you know that suddenly the pool is Contracting it's like oh that's not what I expected not what I wanted so it's annoying me a little bit it's kind of the other way around to what we were expecting because we thought maybe with with Palmer and sacka competing with each other it would give you the option but actually they're not competing with Harland and Salah at the moment so why would you go there what we actually need at the moment is is for Palmer sa to be competing with like Lis Diaz and you know th those types of players because they're the ones where we're we're kind of moving around Salah and Har at the moment going anywhere foden's the big one I think when come back and start hitting anywhere near the form he showed last season I think that's when people might yeah but he's not in the starting lineup tonight again is he you know I I thought he might be saved for Europe but no I mean the other thing is you know we need harand to stop scoring loads of goals [Music] but yeah well here's anyway here my team I'm a lot less um grumpy than than you are had a okay week uh 59 points for me Henderson in goal porro Robinson and Trent I mean that was a disaster um Robinson conceding to a 95th minute Danny in equalizer is just absolute Peak FPL I bought in Salah and Pedro Pedro didn't play Salah blanked uh I got Smith row Off the Bench though and I tell you what I was worried going into Sunday because I sold esack and sacka and when sacka got that assist and I still had ESAT left I thought I could be on the back of about a 20 25 Point swing here but actually with with with Smith coming off my bench I was about I was one point up on on that move so one point up were you I thought you were still down on it okay yeah because ISAC only got the one point didn't he yeah he hea with the one um sacka with seven Smith row matched him and then Sal with two yeah I mean it's crazy is it look at your team right they I mean obvious got Mata but you only got two players a turn Mata and Smith row and Smith row was on your bench so it's was like so many teams just had either Harland and one return or that's about it it was I mea I mean obviously was a big differential for you so well done but um took over as well luy lucky that that happened cuz penalty in the in the 9th minute I just would have assumed a would have taken it and and was the player I was really fearing this week so yeah very very lucky with that um I'm really disappointed in Rogers Gordon and jotter all blanking I mean would Waker Rogers oh it's crazy and he played well last night as well and um people are saying like is he is he gonna go on this ridiculous run of looking like the best player on the pitch in every game and not getting any returns and um it is it is crazy I mean it's got to happen soon isn't it and they've still got good fixtures left so you've got to hope that it's going to drop for him soon but then I mean the Jan thing is all very weird I just don't know what they do I mean again Watkins subbed on 60 Minutes last night yeah little bit of on his leg Yeah I think he's all right I mean he'll start it'll start the weekend but what does Emory do with Duran because Duran's like like a immovable object at the moment you got to give him minutes haven't you and we're not just talking five and 10 you've got to give him a decent 2025 so I don't know does Watkins come off every game and that's the only way or does he get can he get Morgan Rogers out wide and Duran in with Watkins does that even work I don't know I don't know because is playing well Ramsay's playing well Duran's playing well Watkins isn't going anywhere it's very tricky to know what I mean I assume Duran would start yesterday and you know against young boys I know it was their first Champions League game in in kind of forever but I thought why not why not see I was I was quite surprised to see Rogers um play he got the 90 again didn't he last night Rogers as well don't think he yeah he did yeah yeah czy I didn't expect him to play I I thought Duran would start Rogers wouldn't start um but he just seems to I mean you're quite right he loves Rogers he's playing superbly but he's just not returning for us and and I just don't know I mean they've got the caribo Cup tie so we got to think that Duran will start that so maybe that means that he doesn't have a big impact on Watkins minutes at the weekend you can't Bank on it I think what I mean that's it I said that Watkins is back and Watkins is an option but if he's he's only ever played an hour so far in every game so like a we invest in a player that's only getting an hour because you know we've said before you want your Striker on for stoppage time because we know the XG goes up around that period so it's that's not great either is it so it's like yeah I don't know apart from Harland and obviously we'll see salah's had his best start to the season for a long time as well the other kind of second tier assets just I don't know they need to do more they need to do more to make the season what we thought it would be yeah yeah and I mean even even jot for example example I mean J was my kind of way about going against Salah uh and that just obviously hasn't and I'm really worried about his his potential to start because I thought gakpo played quite well yeah yesterday um and Diaz is getting 60 70 minutes in the league almost every week as well that's not really being talked about but he's he's not playing anywhere near near 90 um you see the comments as well from from slot saying he was gonna play gakpo as well but he was tired or something from his his Min Diaz flying around the world I know and and and jotter I don't know you you talked about it last week didn't you is he is he in the firmino role and and like did you see I don't know whether you saw J had hardly got the touch of the ball against for us like we shut him down completely and they just couldn't get the ball anywhere near him and apart from the one chance he he did have their best chance but he was so quiet like he was just not a factor at all and so the system that that slot is playing although it has got the best out of Diaz and we've seen him step up I've never seen jotter have less impact than than I'm seeing he's not playing a part in the buildup really and they're not getting they're not getting supply to him so that's that is a worry because how long is it before gapo becomes a factor in the middle down the middle or even dare I say it Darwin Nunes I don't think Darwin Nunes is I think Darwin Darwin isn't worry gone he's gone he's gone yeah yeah but but that's one good thing to come from this season so far because we don't want any of that yeah Darwin had come off the bench and started making a bit of a case for himself I think there would be people going there but yeah yeah luckily it's uh it's not us um gr and the goods uh on the screen lots of red arrows yeah this week as you can see pra and Harry both leading the way both on a red uh I'm on a green I'm one of four managers in the Great and the good uh on a on a green um I said I would I'd be happy with staying about where I was which was about 900k um got a green up to 636 okay so I'm approaching my best rank in the last two seasons which was about 400,000 last year it's got to be one of your best starts for a while isn't it I think it probably is I think it probably is my my best start for a while um yes hopefully can build on that not so good for you we were neck and neck and now there's a what a 30 point difference between us I'm trying to remember the last time we did a 23 points when was the last time we did a black box where you were beating me uh the last episode of the the end of the season one by one point I think I was beating you every week last season yeah no no I was beating you at one point because um you Ben to Super Nan right that that was game week two that was the mat challenge so like you're beating me by 20 points that's that's the biggest evidence that f is broken of course right regardless of everything else I've said the fact you'll beating me by 20 fbl is broken it's gone G's gone um late r exactly the same points48 I know and exact yeah I mean their teams are similar and and they've got Harland I mean like look at the start they've had and they've got harand so and I think they had Harland from the start didn't they so like harland's not the Silver Bullet you've got to have a decent team around him as well and a lot of managers I mean I think all the managers above me have got Harland and Salah now ready for ready for the forest game ironically a lot of people got him in for The Forest game and um and obviously the games at Bournemouth to come next week of this week of course so salah's not a differential for me anymore I've got to hope that that son or sacka get me Summit this week um and then with odard out and sacka at Man City probably not going to happen is it so I don't know I I we're talk about what I'm doing at the end of the show but I mean it's a grim read this even though there's a lot of Harland ownership there a lot of red yeah well shout out to Seb who has got the same points as Zar and late Riser but hasn't made any transfers at all this season he's he's committed to this getting as many transfers stored as he can isn't he Y and he got Inu Off the Bench this week yeah imagine making no transfers and still having Inu um if you are struggling if you are in the millions uh don't worry um if you look at the table on the bottom you'll be able to see that this season uh if you look at the Great and the good average positions at this point this is basically the worst start the the Great and the good have had so I remember 22 23 um that was a difficult season the average rank at this stage was 1.4 million the average rank at this season is 2 million look at it look at it in 2122 yeah 2 yeah wow so at this stage we the average was 240k so almost every manager in the great good had a really incredible start is that right wow okay yeah I know no isn't it and team value is the lowest it's been in the last four years 100.5 um yeah it's uh the transfers are about the same hit are about the same but those gameweek one teams just like you say haven't really performed and I think if you if you had Harland and reyer you probably had a decen start to the season if you didn't have either of those then you're probably two or three million that's probably about how it how is right nothing wrong with being two or three million as nothing wrong with I looked back last year and I was 3.1 million this time last year so you know just outside the top 10K right yeah but I mean I don't know I I didn't enjoy last season at all despite getting 12K and a good rank I thought it was the most tedious season ever so I'm more I'm more about like is this going to be a season where it's going to be twists and turns and and it looked like it was going to be and I I don't know I sound like a broken record and maybe it's all going to perk up a bit in a few weeks maybe this week it's going to turn it around sacka goes and gets a couple of goals and sun looks amazing and Palmer comes good and all of a sudden everyone wants I really hope so no we don't want that we don't we don't need any more of that as we're about to see in a minute well we'll see uh right now so this these tables these these tables are the are the starts after four game weeks the top 10 in terms of points um per per start so Harland has led the way in each of the last three seasons after game week four um he got six goals in four games last season he had six goals in four games the season before that he's got nine goals in four games this time out his points per start is 13.5 uh which is obviously the highest uh probably the highest we've ever seen right it is it is yeah yeah there can't be players had nine in nine and four and it's also officially his best four run of four game weeks he's ever had in those three seasons as well so he's beaten his personal best for that span of game weeks and he's beaten his best start ever I mean this this this highlights what a strong starter we all is and fine we we knew that but wow I mean even pep said didn't he that he's surprised at what he's seen from him um and it's interesting isn't it that Salah and Holland are the top two and we were all saying before the season started well they've had a rest they've had the summer off and and obviously you can say it's down to that I mean it may not be but it it it it probably was a factor in that they're the two top scores Salah on 43 points I think that's his best ever start as well I had to look at his past Seasons um and the Scout data doesn't unfortunately have FB points right the way back to 2021 but um his previous best in the last five years has been 38 points so he has he has had an incredible start as well for his by his standards he wasn't in the top 10 last season or the top 10 the season before I think he got 23 points last season at this stage and 25 the season before so he's almost doubled well not quite but he's you he's added 18 points onto last season's tally at this stage I mean that is amazing is it for for a player as well in the last year of their contract you know getting on a bit in the league with all the competition around him um you know with J with Diaz with all these other amazing players and yeah he's still 10 point 10.8 without Harland that would be the best start Freddy player in the last three years for sah but because harland's there it's it's kind of equipped it um Diaz is on the list uh points of 8.8 that would put him um that would also put him second I think to yeah in the last two years that'd be higher than Ino last year um oh we Rodrigo Rodrigo's Amazing Star God I remember that I didn't get any of those any of those points um but yeah a great start for him got got a shout out Gabrielle and Rea though I mean I I went into this with no Arsenal defense whatsoever I thought you know games against Brian games against Villa game against Spurs I could make do without a Defender and and try and get to six without one Rey has just been unbelievable and the only other goalkeeper who features on his top 10 in the last three seasons amazingly is Dean Henderson I know forest and the irony of that because he's been bloody awful for people and I've got him in my team I'm literally looking at R who I want and looking at Henderson thinking oh dear he's taunting you there because he saved a penalty for Forest as well didn't he um 22 in four games show you how difficult it is for a keeper to get in this top 10 it's like you know Henderson's in there because of a pen save and 22 saves so that's an incredible obviously return of saves in terms of save points as well I mean we we we would never expect Ry to have 15 Saves by now would we we wouldn't expect him to have three clean sheets and 15 saves we might expect to have three clean sheets and five saves but but not 15 and because he's got 15 saves he's also picked up six bonus points which again I don't know did he even get that many bonus points last season for the entirety of the Season I'll G have a look um because because Gabrielle and C only got about six all season last season R got six six bonus points yeah there he go so he's already leveled his bonus points tally for last season in four game weeks I mean that's and yet we were saying start of the Season well you can forget bonus points for Keepers well we we were saying forget bonus points for Keepers if they concede even if they make like 11 saves they're not getting a bonus but it does look like if a goalkeeper keeps a clean sheet they are very very likely to get at least one bonus point and he is they will get the most clean sheets this season but but I would say he's in a team where because obviously the other factors is shots on Target and fouls one and perhaps you know Arsenal haven't done enough in those in those metrics to rival him and knock him out the BPS like they're not full of players who are having loads of shots and so I mean we'll get to the attacking data later I don't think Arsenal are in the top three or four teams there so perhaps and you know with oard out perhaps they're not going to be um maybe they're gonna have to rely on winning games one on two nil um but it works so why not shout out to mumo on here who is ninth on the list for this season with his his two goals against Southampton is his goal before that uh obviously he was second last year after that great run before he had and yeah that might be the move I Look to do in that J to mumo move which is maybe a bit a bit earlier than I would have liked but might be might be sensible because he clearly gets off to good starts um so yeah want to one to monitor uh let's take a look at some team data then let's start with team data uh defense not huge amounts of changes from when we talked about this last week we got Liverpool at the top then Man City and then forest and yeah I think talk to us about about Forest how how on Earth did they stop Liverpool well I think that in in Ana and um and Moreno we've got I mean th th those two on anfield were absolutely fantastic I mean the two of the best fullback performances I've seen from a forest team um not just Moreno I mean he made six he won six of his seven tackles against Salah Salah really didn't really get much out of him at all and I knew at half time I was saying I think I tweeted I said I don't I just don't see sah getting anything because we're just throttling them and every time Salah gets anywhere near the ball Moreno's on him we were so aggressive we were right in their face and M Movic and and Melo are just a great combination Murillo obviously very mobile low center of gravity milinkovic a bit of a brute strong in the air really strong in the air and a leader so those two and the two fullbacks look it looks like a really good defensive unit so I do think that we were top five for defensive data last season I think or top six but we didn't really we didn't turn into clean sheets I think we kept one didn't we I don't know I think one or two clean sheets is all we got I think this season though is different because the whole season yeah I think we only kept a couple of clean sheets All Season it was pretty bad um I think that this season though we will we've we've solved the setpiece issue with melan kovic there and I just think we're growing as a team and yeah we're going to get more clean sheets and suddenly I mean as a I mean I'm probably opposite to you I kind of don't try and talk up Forest too much because I know that what are you implying what are you implying I know that as FBO assets they're not I wouldn't advise going there right Gibbs white maybe at the start of season I was pushing him but I wasn't wasn't talking about our defense even though the data was good last season but having watched that I do think that Moreno at 44 oreno at 44 both of them at 44 really good prospects yeah really good because I think we are going to go we haven't we didn't concede at Southampton we haven't conceded at Liverpool we've won four straightway games now and we've kept clean sheets in the last two we're gonna C start keeping clean sheets at home and we've got Fulham Palace Leicester West Ham Newcastle in a run there that I would say there's two or three clean sheets there potentially because I think our defense is strong enough to keep to keep Fulham Palace Leicester and even West Ham I think we'll get a couple of clean sheets out of that four so yeah if you're looking for 4 five44 oena Moreno probably would be my choice because he offers so much going forward and and so it is probably time for me to take the nonforest blinkers off and go yeah yeah have a look at them yeah as soon as you start to show a bit of Faith it's all it's all G to go I know that's the thing we'll get fresh at Brighton I mean because it's it's still I mean Robinson's just had a a price Rise um but he goes into Newcastle Forest Man City Villa in the next four which isn't great I mean then Everton away Everton are awful defensively but are managing to to score goals um and then it's brenford who are also managing to score whereas like you say forest around that time Brighton Fulham Palace Leicester West Ham seems if I was buying a Defender now it definitely wouldn't be Robinson um I'd be look I'd be looking an or I've just got a soft spot for Moreno oh yeah he's he's he's got the quality going forward as well I mean I would say he is as good as Robinson going forward he is an attacking fullback and he's probably got better delivery than Robinson um Robinson's obviously got that relationship down that side now and he's been in Fulham for a couple of seasons and whereas Moreno hasn't so he's more settled but I think Moreno will flourish at Forest and and yeah I think it's good I think it's good to talk about he's got to be someone we look at any more love for Sals um I think weer I mean like the back four looks solid but the keeper is still a worry we will buy a keeper in January I've absolutely no doubt but until then you can go sales yeah because he's going to play every week I think because I don't think um I don't think theu girl's ready but we are undoubtedly buy a keeper in January because I think it's obviously now the weak spot in the team um so we'll address it and I think we'll go back in for kellerer I think we'll try again so okay yeah yeah but yeah and Elsewhere on his table I mean Villa showing up well Arsenal in fifth I mean it's perhaps what we expect I mean is there a defense there you expect to be higher maybe United you expect to be pushing a little bit higher Newcastle haven't really picked up from where they were last season despite having an easy run in terms of fixtures their defense still doesn't look worth investment and and what can you say about Everton at the moment I mean yeah it's yeah there's not too many surprises I would expect brenford to be higher I mean ahead of their good run you'd expect them to climb that table right yeah obviously vaner B's come in four million option for us uh I guess there's a slight concern about whether if he if he doesn't play three at the back whether he keeps his place but you've always been pretty hot on him haven't you like 25 million pounds they they paid yeah he's a good player yeah I think he's he's he's pretty much I'd definitely be taking the punt on him if I could if they back four he's not guaranteed a start because Collins Collins and pinnick at the moment of the first choice I would say yeah uh Newcastle I'm surprised that being being a bit I know obviously they they paid that Southampton um game but teams look really easy to to get at them there doesn't seem to be a lot of um solidity there wolves carve them open time and time again um really they were lucky to escape that game you know two individual moments of absolute Brilliance another kind of share rocket although a little bit of a a deflection but the bars winner was you know worthy of winning winning any game but W wolves had some really good chances in in that match um and they're doing well I mean look at the if you look at the rating like you know we know how tough the start they've had but they're 11th on the on the table so credit to to them um yeah I like wolves uh you know I like stran Larson I thought he played really well in that game there there's a lot of play like a Nori a lot of players who we've talked about who we might consider but yeah it's just not not the best time for them um yeah nothing really massively surprising I guess the only one to really talk about here is is Villa because obviously K is really popular but clean sheets just don't seem to be coming but the defensive underlying that's a good we've seen this before with teams like Palace in previous years when defensive data's always been at the highest but just hasn't translated I don't know about coner I'm still not I'm not convinced he's a good option out of Robinson and cono who would you keep yeah that's a good question because Robinson's got the attacking threat but con's got the fixtures I guess you would keep coner out of the two if I had to pick one of the two it probably would be coner but I don't think i' I'd pick him so I'd rather go for Moreno or or rer or um I mean who what we come on to defenders in a bit Davis I think leave leave Davis now Swit his fixtures looking better I think I'd take a punt on him because just for a bit of excitement really yeah or sagawa you're just trying to make me say Sara aren't you Sara good we talked about him last week um but I prefer Leaf Davis I mean like for me set plays and and I think it's only he's got one assist but we haven't really seen the best of him yet it which needs home games if you look at the ticker I think they've got some fixtures coming up where you'd expect them to start showing up as an attacking Force I mean their bottom of the attacking data we're probably about to see that so they haven't really been able to to flex in that way but I think that's coming I really like the look of dap and I think they've got players they they've bought well and I think of the promoted teams they they for me are the one that I think could break out and give us some joy in terms of fbl assets dap was like horrible because I I went to the I went to the Brighton game um missed the first 20 minutes because of a lot of stress uh but D when dap came off the whole crowd breed the side relief because you know he didn't offer too much but that run he went on when he just completely outpaced van heck and I thought I I thought van heex either going to bring him down for a penalty or he's going to score and you know just off the the top of the bar it was so a great option Davis was was really Shackled though he barely came forward at all in that game and it was yeah it switch just put all the men behind the ball and just look to to hit on the on the counter which is I think gavves is a hell of a player as well should have got him every ball we put in he's there just heading it away he's yeah he was he was brilliant uh attack we got City at the top top attack obviously got Harland putting chance is away Liverpool still second despite the blank at Forest Manchester United in third I saw was it Jan batra tweeted about rashford trying to get people in in you know invested in him yeah I mean what do you think I was gonna mention him later no you don't you're not I was like I was like no we can't be going near rashford but you know a goal against the mighty barley in the cup good performance before two didn't he I I mean we talked I mean I moaned about what we need you know we need a bit of a bit of a pep and um I think if rashford was to come good that's that's the kind of thing we need right you know like a I don't know I mean I I mean obviously everyone would flood to him I think he's so streaky though isn't he that's the trouble it's like it's it's time in it with rashford I mean couple of seasons ago I got him on at the right time and I CED him a few times and it turned out really well for me but then I think you know we've seen him just collapse again and yeah it'll be good to see him back to some for and being in our thoughts again I would welcome it I think yeah I I don't know I mean the other option is is gacho but he's not starting is he because Dio's no keeping him but he he's he's brilliant every time he comes off the bench some you know he scored in in the last Premier League game OB he scored yesterday as well I I don't know how long Doo can keep him him out for um he will be an option at 65 at some point in the season I'm sure he will yeah yeah I mean I I know you're not United fans feel is a bit of a mystery as to why he's not starting yet um and until he does we can't go there but yeah I mean there could be options coming from United which would be nice because they've been a bit of a it's been a yeah a derf is we haven't really been a to go there at all um for a while defensively they've been really shaking I still wouldn't trust them defensively but if they if those two come out then yeah it'd be that would be very useful indeed Viller in fourth Brighton in in fifth we we did show a bit of a different side to us I thought in that if switch game and not in a good way which is how much we struggle to break down um you know that kind of low block defending really deep team and yeah we we've seen that before that's been classic Brighton you know lots of kind of half chances dominating the game not being able to kill it off um I think other than mata's uh you know shot which he he should have scored with we didn't really create that much and I think ifwi were actually fairly comfortable um against us because we couldn't do what we normally do which is you know create loads of space out wide get all Wingers like cutting in hitting on the counter because there was nothing to really counter because they weren't really they didn't have the ball so our High Press High counter method didn't really work so I wanted to maybe see we had like a plan B for that and you know against Everton we we we we maybe did we maybe looked better as as the game went on but we didn't really against we could have played that game for another two hours and not scored against ipswitch you're getting me very excited for Sunday because I'd like to think we're better defensively and better offensively than it witch so that's going to be interesting but will you go for it um no I think we'll probably play a very similar game to we did at Liverpool um I I would have thought I think we'll start Hudson adoy but I don't think we'll start both of them um yeah I think we are going to beat you I think we are so I know well we'll talk about predictions in a bit my my dad is four out of four for Brighton so far he's predicted the draws against ipsw and Arsenal which is outrageous and the wins against Everton and Manchester United so he he thinks we're gonna win so it's um it's very different to you the big thing is if we got Pedro back R was really ineffective was he that game oh that's good news for Pedro owners yeah it is good news I'm I'm gonna say it and I I probably get Slamm for it but I'm sure Pedro comes back into the 11 if you got him yeah no I think you're right yeah that's nice uh we're fifth on the table look at the bottom three though Southampton Lester it switch just what I was about to come to and and Everton as well I mean Everton Southampton Lester and I switch they've got to be the four favorites to be fighting it out for promotion um out relegate yeah obviously relegation not promotion um they're and ipswitch are the ones who I think have got the best chance of yeah staying up I think at this point yeah um out of the four I mean Jamie vard's scoring goals but he's barely having any shots and you got to think that conversion isn't goingon to isn't going to carry on but yeah it switch right down x n p 90 of 0.39 that is you know Leicester a 19th with 0.83 they' that is incredibly low it is but I think the fixtures are King here that's why I think they will start to come out there sh I think when McKenna looked at the pictures he thought we're not going to be able to show ourselves until what five or six games in so I think that they've given a good account themselves already and I think there's enough there to make me think there's po so we'll see I really hope so because I really want be great if Lee Davis is is is goes one further than doubt he did last year for loon you know goes to double figures for assists or something that' be great um other thing to mention here I mean we talked about you know the Arsenal attack and it hasn't been on point yet which is perhaps where Rya has been in the bonus where it shows there is their 12 right 1.25 XG on penalty per 0 I'm very surprised at that um I mean they again again against Arsenal um I don't know what's wrong with I can't even speak properly against Brighton they obviously dominated the play sacka got a lot of joy down the side they had a couple of chances but nothing massively clearcut I wouldn't I wouldn't have thought even H's goal was a brilliantly well taken lob um against against Spurs they struggled in the first 20 30 minutes to even get out I Spurs played really well massively on the front foot too so yeah I'm I'm surprised in the sense that they've got so much like great attacking like talent in the team um and you think with games against wolves um and against Brighton they would they would maybe have created a little bit more um than they they have done sack are really interest to know what to do with we talked about him at the start already but if odard is out and this is going to be a bit of a pattern then yeah I think he's he's sellable isn't he well the other thing is it impacts havit as well like havit was going to be perhaps a real hope for us as an eight million forward but if he's going to play the Midfield role which looks like he is we're not going to gamble on tra are we as a field asset maybe we will but that's how it's looking I mean Jesus is a threat to tr Arlo so I look at it and think the oard injury it redu his sack's appeal it moves havoc's back which jedu is his appeal tr's not an option because jeesus is a threat to him Suddenly It's like well if you want Arsenal you just go Ry and a Defender don't you and it's like that's that's what I meant when I started the show with a bit of oh dear it feels like things are Contracting before our very high is and the OD injury is just another twist that does it really I mean the thing for Watkins is another twist that we didn't expect that like who expected us to think oh Watkins is an next min's problem no chance of that we thought it was a 90 minute player didn't we but I don't see that stopping either so it's annoying it's just annoying like hopefully sacka comes through it and saaka takes the mantle and goes even without OD God I'm going to be the key man and my output's not going to be affected but we'll see I mean we'll see the Jew is out isn't it I've just had a message from focal uh about about the OBS uh video resolution so I've just changed a couple of settings on on OBS uh I can't honestly everything looks fine on my screen so we're using OBS and we're not using OBS are but we are technically because we're streaming it to thingy anyway I've tried I've tried a few things let me know if that stunt made any difference whatsoever uh maybe it has maybe hasn't um but yeah let me let me know uh should get some play data we can let's have a look at goalkeepers to start with I think we did a quite a big segment um on this I don't think anything's massively changed too much apart from the fact that sales might be an option for us uh going forward but I still think you're going to go ryer or you're gonna go flecken at this point aren you yeah I think that's the way isn't it I mean what I interesting what wild cards do I I think because of the oard injury we're going to see wild cards with Ry and Gabrielle now um which you know at the start of the Season people really have gone V has too much to pay for a keeper but it's a bit like Harland is it nowhere near as um profitable but 29 points for a keeper is still good and I'm I mean I've been on the end of I mean I've had Seasons where I've own that keeper like flecking on 12 points and started looking up and thinking I thought not having a good keeper is not a big deal but there's already 17 points between fle and and Martin and and ryer and Henderson there's 21 points different so is that 21 points worth a million it probably is it probably is isn't it so and we're not talking about Rea who's playing for a team who isn't about you know they're the best defensive team as well so I do think we're starting to come around to the idea now I'd be surprised if Rey wasn't very popular in wild cards anyway yeah I mean look at Henderson down in 23rd eight points um Ry matched him in an away game against Spurs his entire season points it's uh yeah absolutely it's amazing how that adds up how the keeper really because you your perception is it's the position that has the least impact on your team I think it still probably is but when there is one or two keepers really racing away with it and we've seen it in previous Seasons you look up and think oh God the Gap is quite big it's much bigger than I expected Fen I think you know is a very good bet because he'll make saves and they got great fixtures so four FS are still going to be an option because of fen's fixtures but I do think the odard thing might make people think well I don't need two Arsenal attackers so I'm going to go an Arsenal Defender and I'll go ryer I think that might be what we see I think Ray's Reay is the pick I think Ray is the pick out of the Arsenal defense I think R's the pick out of the goalkeepers um his price hasn't gone up yet which he must be on the verge of going up to to 5'6 um he'll be a six million goalkeeper by the end of the the season I've got no doubt um and I mean how many points can he get he's he's on track to score the most of any goalkeeper ever surely because I mean how many clean sheets are they going to get this season 38 games they could get 15 men I say 15 15 20 15 20 clean sheets yeah I mean the thing is he's showing to be a really good keeper isn't he as well because like in Pre I think last season it was like well he's a yeah he's a top 10 Keeper in a top one defense but when tested ry's you know gonna concede goals but actually this season he's shown up to be pretty outstanding when when they have let chances through and they have he's he's made some really good saves so he deserves to be there on Merit it's not because he's you know the defender has done all the work for him he actually has put in shifts and made some good saves so you're getting a very good Keeper in front of or behind a very good defense um so but I do think four FES could still come out sales we've talked about fleen as well so it's not a done deal not yet for br he's very impressive I thought he was he was very impressive against hip switch as well and when he was called into action he he just looks very astute very confident um yeah I I do still worry I did the forest pod today uh with uh with Matt which was which was really good um he lets me talk about Brighton when I go on there unlike you who shut me down yeah okay very nice he actually asks me my opinions on on Brighton lets me go on monologue I must have a word him he's got it all wrong yeah it's been lovely um I can't remember the point I was trying to make but yeah it was H you worried about wor about the ball over the top that's it um I don't think we've got like well exactly yeah well you haven't got any Pace or we haven't well not really I mean like if alanga comes on then you got to worry but I don't think he'll start so I mean Hudson or against velman would be interesting yeah he reminded me of um last season we we come off the back of that Roma thrashing and then we played you and you put out a really weird like was terrible team and we ended up winning that game and I just think surely you play Hudson or Danga against veltman and I mean who's even gonna be at left back it's probably gonna be kadogo I'd say um because I don't think Hood's gonna play there again kadogo got some minutes in in the last game it's going to be that'll be a tough matchup for him I think Langer is is class but you don't think he'll start no I think he'll play W prow and Anderson and we'll try and win a few few free kicks around the box and let War prows do his thing so we'll see I just want war war prows is a player that when I've ever watched him for Southampton and West Ham I've thought to myself I wish we had a player who every time the free kick is won you're you're genuinely excited because you're expecting it to be on target if not going in and now he's in our team I just can't wait for the first fre kick we win because that anticip score this and you know the opposition fans are like oh Christ it's really good I really I really enjoy having him in the team so I think for that reason he'll play um yeah we'll see anyway let's move on to Defenders so we can't talk about you're you're going right you're going on Sunday yeah yeah yeah I'll be doing my walkout videos from Brighton on Sunday morning and taking some footage from the game as well so make sure you get there in plenty of time unlike yellow and I who just completely messed up our timing what happened we we we just we left a bit late a bit too late and it was one of those ones where we would have got away with it if there wasn't all the traffic in the world and then we got to we got to M Park uh where you because you have to get a park and ride bus over to the stadium from from the from from Mil road that was completely full so we had to park at the wi Dean which was our old stadium and get a taxi over to the stadium we got stuck in traffic yeah we a football match who would have fought it I absolutely outage the game had bloody started it was you know 10 minutes in and there was there was yeah it's basically however long you think it's going to take you to get to the AMX add another hour onto it um it was funny because we walking around the like right the outside of the wood bean and I said to you know this is this is our old stadium she was like this this was a stadium just just about um this is Defender data um on the on the screen look at that milinkovic right at the top 0.66 is that just because of like one really good chance yeah that one for match of day challenge where I went oh remember yeah so um yeah but he second yeah he's obviously a threat to set plays and obviously with James wpr's taking him we could see something from him so yeah but I still prefer the fullbacks if you're looking at Forest players um yeah go ahead Trent and then Romero and delit as well showed up didn't he for the goals at Sav Anton he did yeah I mean let's talk about Trent quickly I mean what at what point does Trent become an issue for us because we're talking about him like he's completely indispensable and you know we wouldn't go anywhere near him that's that's fine but it's still no attacki returns for him he is still seven million-ish and there are going to be wild cards being played are we entering into a period where there might be a case to go without him I wouldn't personally not yet um I can see what you're saying um I mean I don't know against Forest he didn't really C he had four chances but none of those really were good were good chances um but it was a difficult game for him the best is to come I still think that he's going to be you you're not going to be hitting registering an average of 0.64 and not getting returns so we will start seeing assist soon um and he'll get two three four goals maybe over the season as well I I still think that teams Wild Card teams will be buil built with him in I don't think there's strong Alternatives yet I mean City Defenders yeah vardal is there of course Lewis is there but Lewis doesn't really cost you money and and and he's obviously still an option he's starting tonight which I didn't expect um so why you can go Lewis to cover the city defense why would you not have the money to go Trent to cover to cover Liverpool unless unless of course you're going to go Gabrielle and porro and Rya so maybe like that combination means you need to bring your budget down for Trent so maybe maybe you know the emergence of the Arsenal defense is the way to go rather than going to Arsenal attackers you go to Arsenal Defenders that might mean people have to move money out of their defense but I wouldn't do it I'd stick with it it's four game week small sample and and the data suggests that returns are coming all sack is hang on he as a season keeper last week um yeah absolutely I mean it's just one of those on like Rogers isn't it like you watch Rogers play you think he's close to points and it the weeks go on and on he's not really delivering um Rogers is a five million asset you can bench but Trent needs to start getting something but I mean these stats are so encouraging aren't they like 0.64 EX on P 90 you know he's creating three chances a game um the second best is poro with 2.5 is also a good option but it's it's even higher than that um he's he's not going anywhere he's not going anywhere from my team I'm keeping him yeah and I I don't think wild cards will overlook him yet um you're right patience might run out but I think that's Folly and and I also think defensively Liverpool are better this season too so you're gonna get more clean sheets anyway which makes it easier if he was eight million Yeah by now we probably see people losing patience but I think at 7even million with the with the options around him um I think that's fine I think you hold him and I think he will will come good and then some so yeah you'd rather have him than Diaz J would you I think if you're going to pick one other than seller yeah are the x-min um you know they're only getting an hour and that's a real shame isn't it I mean I really want Diaz to be a thing but with Gatos showing up so well last night um you've got to think that it's going to continue that we're going to see Diaz every time you get to an hour mark between 60 and 70 minutes if you own Diaz or josy you're expecting it aren't you you're expecting the ball to go up and you're almost thinking oh don't kick it out try and play try play for another 10 minutes without kicking it out because it's a horrible feeling I've owned those assets before and eventually you start going n let's go to an E or a gon who are gonna give me 90 minutes basically yeah Lewis let's talk about Lewis I think I said to you last week is there a chance Lewis could go to left back and we were both we were both kind of like yeah I mean he could do but kind of why why would he because obviously gavardo was there um that is what happened happened I don't know if that's good for him or or not because he's surely not going to carry on it's good in the way that he can he's obviously versatile he can play in different positions so he's got more Roots into the team but yeah you'd rather he would nail down a spot on the right potentially doesn't case that he's on the right tonight he's on the right tonight and um I'm shocked because I thought Walker was back in the weekend to get him ready for tonight and then Walker doesn't show up tonight I don't know if there's an injury I haven't seen that but um I think it's clear that you know Lewis is getting the level of minutes that Lewis is getting he obviously was off at halim on Saturday that must have been with this in mind I guess I don't know it's just really strange we can't yet figure it out and I think now that European fixures are here we'll get more answers I was chatting to Luke about it and it's like it's almost like we've got to throw out what we know so far about Pep's lineups and kind of start again and reassess and tonight's lineup is is interesting it's not what I expected I did expect Walker to be in there and Lewis maybe to make way do we think Lewis starts against Arsenal I I personally not expecting him to and I've got him benched but if I knew he was going to start I might even start him because you know he does offer you something something going forward as well he's just the darling at the moment and at the moment I just see him St in most games would you buy him now yes I think I think you would if you wild card I think you give it another week I think you want to see what happens against Arsenal if you're wild card in six it's pretty perfect and most people are going to be wild card in gameweek six or seven now would have for unless people are going to push it right out I think you wait and see what happens against Arsenal if he starts against Arsenal I said doneal isn't it you've got to you got to go there I think so because eventually I think it's a bit like Trent the attacking data here .41 xra on penalty he's got one assist so far he's going to add to that with that you know in that team he's going to get more assists and perhaps one or two goals as well so you can't avoid him I don't you know I don't think you can ignore him yep uh I wanted to talk about Robertson he was a bit of a a darling this this week I know quite a few people did um Gabrielle to J robber I think Ben Kellin did didn't he oh got hurt isn't it ouch yeah it was um it was it was quite quite a popular move do you think they'll people be regretting that now I mean he shows up well on this he's 10th on the list .32 XG we've talked about Liverpool you know looking decent defensively he got the rest in the Champions League yesterday Sim played in that so you got to think he's pretty nailed on um to start I still think he's a he's a pretty good asset but I still think at six million I'd rather have Gabrielle I'd rather have sber um you know I'd rather have porro I'd rather have Tren he's still quite far down the list for me I don't know if I Gabrielle yes I'd rather have Gabrielle I think there is for me if we know Gabrielle and Cela both start every game Who Would You Rather Have I think there's quite a gap between Gabriel and civa I think we talked about it earlier um in the pre-season about who's going to be the threat at set plays and and what we saw at Spurs was he was a monster wasn't he I mean like Romero just didn't know what to do and there there is a difference isn't there when the set Pieces come in there's a difference in the level of threat between CRA and Gabrielle and I think that in the end could tell and could mean that Gabrielle gets gets more points but I guess is there still a naging doubt that CBA is more nailed I guess there is right yeah I guess so but Gabriel has started it's bit of a contrast to last season when he was dropped and kind of had to fight his way back into the team um he he started so so impressively um I mean no no no one scored more from set pieces than Gabrielle since he signed no player and no Defender scored more set pieces than Gabrielle since he signed as well so you know he he he could go on and I mean who's who's got the record for most goals for for Defenders probably I can't even I can't even think of it might maybe um John Terry got didn't he ianov he he scored quite a few ivovic a few yeah I mean he could have a season where he gets seven eight goals yeah that's what I'm thinking I I think that could happen because the set pieces from Arsenal look even better D than they did last season and they were scoring for for fun uh they just caused so many issues and when when you're up against a keeper like Vicario who you know you know he's not going to come out and claim it very well it just it's just an easy way to Target points and to win the game with that is just it was funny though I was watching Liverpool and Milan last night and and Liverpool got the first goal canate from a set play and you watch the goal back and you thought oh my God just look at like they've got nothing to stop Liverpool at set plays like canato and Van djk they look like they just want it far more than any of the Milan defense and then 20 minutes later vanite scores as well same thing and it was like that Arsenal Spurs you know you saw set plays and you just think Spurs Spurs just aren't competing for the ball at set plays they're just if the delivery is right it's over they score and they and it happened and you've got to be really strong at set plays to keep Arsenal out because often the delivery is good and in Gabrielle they've got someone who just attacks the ball ferociously and and and it's hard to stop it really is so yes I'd rather have Gabrielle over Robertson because I think it's going to be Arsenal will keep more clean sheets and they'll keep clean sheets in difficult games and Gabrielle's always there it's hard to predict when the goals come but they will come I think he'll get five I think he'll get five for sure yeah so do I yeah I think was was it meron who who said the other day he was like you know sometimes people just Chuck up their center backs and they kind of TR up and you know it it they're doing it because they're told to um whereas the Arsenal center backs go up thinking they're going to score every time yeah they go up um yeah I I I'd be I'd be surprised if Gabrielle didn't get five goals this season um maybe they get shared a bit more between him him and CA maybe the other thing is if odard is out is artetta thinking we're gonna have to make more set place now because you know scoring goals from open Play might be more difficult for us so they might even over index on them they might even put more effort in but their set play coach is is first class and they and they're scoring you know the patterns they run the routines they are you look at him you think oh God how you stop that the movement and aggression is just different level so yeah and a massive shout out to um James of Planet fbl because I was listening to his um ask James podcast and the questions kept coming in you know should I bench Gabrielle do this every time James was like don't bench Gabrielle do not bch Gabrielle against us thing coming yeah he was like they he was like both CRA and Gabriel were both have a good chance against us from a set piece um I can't remember sleep having one but obviously gabri needed one to to score so we absolutely called that um yeah I mean I guess the question is if you had to pick one out of Gabrielle and Rea where would you go I'd want them both now I think but yeah no that's not that's not an option I'd probably go Reay just because you can get poro and you can get Trent and you can get Lewis so you don't have to have Gabrielle but I I think he's by far the best alternative to three now I mean moving porro up to Gabrielle probably people going to look at that I imagine look at this and Robo eight ball got Gabrielle Off the Bench for Pedro oh disgraceful that is that is absolutely I was happy with Smith row but that is next level any other Defenders yeah fair play any other Defenders mention Ben White hasn't shown up yet he's further down there we've talked about AA Moreno isn't on this table yet but a few home games expect him to show up because he will start creating eight nor was going to be an option but wolves have gone back to a back four haven't they so that takes the Shine off him a little bit I think more than a little bit maybe and I've read that walls 16 games without a clean sheet now yeah so defensively they are there to be got at really so maybe you know we talked about him last week but maybe we need to call our boots on him a bit uh Dena um did we talk about him I'm only joking but he got he got the assist didn't he we slay him last week he slay he turned with an assist um played again as well last night in the Champions League he's Matson isn't getting anywhere near the team at the moment no it's just not what we expected at all was it and um he's playing well I guess the only other one I pick out is leaf Davis here he's 29th on this table .16 watch him climb that let's see if he can make the top 10 in a few weeks because I think I wouldn't be surprised if he's climbing that table soon y I think um focal might be on something with these Graphics by the way because apparently they are a lot better yeah okay any complaints while um what I did if you care is I put up the bit rate on OBS oh well thanks to focal for that uh midfielders we got gacho at the top we spoke about him a little while a little while ago 2.34 X non P 90 obviously he hasn't has he started yet he started One D started all not started one game that is madness goalen assist for for him um obviously we can't really consider him I mean Barnes is the same isn't he uh you thought Barnes might might keep Gordon out the side but turns out the other side tell you what he's got to start I mean I when he came on I immediately stuck him in my so rare team and he got me the goal because I knew that he's going to make an impact I think he's been playing really well when he's been on the pitch for Newcastle did well in preseason as well I just don't see how how can leave him out now um because he carries so much direct threat and him and Gordon I mean I I didn't think C played well again I mean I watched the game and I was like as an eak owner first half I was like he might as well go off because I just couldn't see him doing anything know they were gon was good Gordon looked really Lively but that was about it I just don't know what's missing from them this season the The Verve has gone The Verve and the Vigor and the I don't know have you watched them and I've just been totally unconvinced every time I think the the biggest problem is is losing trippier losing the amount of chances he created you think about the start of last season how effective was they were looking to get the ball to him at every opportunity they could so he could create something from the riot and now he's not really in the team they've moved Gordon over to the to the other side um there's just not a lot of creativity in the side so no you're right that's it yeah yeah so they're asking for players to step up with individuals So it's b like watching England um play you know there there's not not a whole amount of cohesion be between the team so they're looking for the big players to step up and create something kind of out of nothing and that is what happened in the Ws game but but I wasn't impressed with them and they've had really good results it's been a really good start of the season results wise but in every match I've been pretty disappointed with them and I'm holding Gordon I mean where's Gordon on this list is he on the top he's not even the top 20 to 30 yeah 30 .68 isn't too bad actually it's pretty good no he has he has played well and um yeah it's just yeah it's just I I just something isn't right at Newcastle and um yeah it makes me wonder as an eak owner how long I can hold him until we've got to we need it to click and he's another example of what we you know isak is a player that if you haven't gone Harland or you haven't gone Harland and Salah you can hold isak and hope where he might be able to trade blows with them too but no not sign of it really because Nas aren't playing well enough yeah no I agree with that uh jotters six on the list we've been talking about him talking about him sort of being you know being a bit poor the last few games but the stats are are impressive I mean Diaz is third 1.39 EX on P for 90 jot is there with 1.25 um and salah's in fourth at 1.31 sort of sandwiched in the middle between them but even with these stats I I'm just not convinced on on Jo I think I think he probably has to go for me right do you think he start bouth I think there's a risk there because of Gat poos performance last night because you got to think Diaz comes back in and Gat post Stak in a claim I I think he loves joto I think I mean and we know that slot doesn't doesn't alternate his team very much although he has he did say last night well we haven't played midweek yet and so yeah I mean J starting last night would suggest that perhaps he does alternate it and and let's face it he's not going to look at the forest performance and think that it worked but he was pleased last night with what he saw but then GPO played a big part in that so you've got to think GST do a start isn't he so yeah there there's a risk there for sure yeah y yeah I think I probably will get rid um Smith row 5.5 million you sold him uh this actually he's up to 5.7 Now isn't he he's he's had a couple of price Rises gold and assist for him still coming off around the 70 minute mark But ex 9 .83 I'm happy with him easy hold easy hold yeah I I do regret selling him I mean the only reason I sold him was because I had the money to go directly Smith Ro toza which meant I could keep son and on the off chance he got something at AR or maybe this week against brenford that was probably worth doing but I regret it because had I gone son to um sonto I'd have had money to to to take whis out now for probably maybe even Watkins I don't know I'd have to do the calculation but I think so so it would have given me more options than my transfer this week had I done that and of course me throw out scored some but yeah it's it's tough got that wrong but it's it could have gone the other way I suppose as well I did expect Arsenal to maybe give up more ground Declan rice there but Spurs never looked like scoring for me they just didn't create enough and S was AB I thought I thought he had a poor game really so yeah Smith row with heavy heart and and maybe if I'm wild carding soon he's someone I will maybe get back oh no classic reversal how you feeling about e now because the underlying stats are good 0.93 he 18 you want more you yeah I mean he's he's shown I mean they seo's had 20 shots and A's had 18 so they're they're the top two for shot volume from Midfield but um it's just not had the output just the one goal and obviously the pens thing now you we thought that was part of the contract when we signed him and it's it's not now because mata's maybe taking them all but so it really is dependent on that I I do think returns will come Man United and Everton next to you've got to keep him for those two because I think he will threaten United because pis will raise himself for that game and Everton well they're conceding three goals in every game so yeah you've got to think he's in in line for something there and out of the cup last night as well to Southampton it's bad for Sean isn't it [ __ ] bad dear but we are G to talk about k l in a minute maybe he's the one to turn him around uh Rogers if you're wondering is 63rd on this list is actually 90 isn't great 0.37 he's more of an eye test player isn't he he's the classic he's the classic grass versus spr sheet yeah I think he is he is literally grass FC's mascot now because I watch him every week and I think how the hell has he not got anything uh from this but I mean he is getting a 90 is five million The Villa fixures are still great it's just like this week for example I probably got a bench one of Smith row or Rogers and that is such a difficult choice because I think the obviously the fixtures with Rogers but Smith row keeps finding a way to get in in bench maybe I should tell you the bench Rogers because the inevitable will happen if you do I mean surely there's a double figure return coming for Rogers that's what I'm thinking that's what I'm thinking and Smith R is Gonna Keep ticking along but I'm still trying to hit that that double digit for Rogers yeah well I haven't got that dilemma I'm gonna I'm gonna start him um yeah but um I would start Rogers myself but yeah he's currently he's currently starting so yeah we'll see uh and the only play I want to talk about was Bowen um he might be a factor for us in a few weeks maybe he's he's um he's a bit pricey but two two assists and a goal ex9 not great 0.41 he's 54th on the list of all midfielders um I can't believe Antonio is still starting for West Ham surely they've got to change that up and get full Krug in or or get another option I think he I think he is yeah I think he is but they've got they got to get him in as soon as he's fit right because Antonio Antonio shouldn't be playing Premier League level anymore should I mean he's still a bit of a handful but yeah I I agree with you and and I just wonder how is Bing not going to play down the middle eventually I mean well that's what I'm ly doesn't want to go there does he it seems so I don't know I don't know West Ham come yeah I mean what's their fixures like I don't really think they pick up that well they're patchy still aren't they I mean it's a big step to go to Bing I think when ino's about and yeah okay they they are they're not bad but the next two it's where's the Run where's the concentrated run where you're expecting returns United Forest Everton I suppose but yeah I mean he can get go it's now isn't it it's it's if you're going to invest in Bowen it's probably now because you get Chelsea at home brenford ipswitch Spurs man united that's not a bad one but would you go for him over embo who's got Spurs West Ham wolves man united switch probably not um I guess if you're if you're only going for Harland you maybe got a bit more money to to play around but yeah I do like Bowen but like you say I think there's there's probably better options and the fixures aren't good enough to to go there I also think under ly are they a side that are going to let rip and score three or four goals I mean they you know I remember them going to Bright them scoring three and beating you on your own territory and under Moyers every now and then they just had that performance that made you think oh you know what Kudos and B in they could be options but under ly at the moment I don't I haven't seen them take the hand break off and that makes me think you know I don't want to go there at the moment I'd love him to be an option though I mean this is what we need we need those players to come through him so let's hope it happens y uh let's go for some forward in for crog is fit okay Niger well I I can't figure out then answers on post as to why Antonio starting he's flagged he's flagged on on F um's he's got a yellow yellow flag um p n says pet was Bench I think that's because of Brazil right because he was he came back from from that um I expect petta to be straight back in but yeah if if f is fit then surely has to he has to go into the side um forwards I don't think we need to talk about Harland anymore I don't want to talk about pretty decent is they I mean the only to mention here is and and and maybe this is a crme of comfort 73% accuracy and 45% conversion rate he he can't keep that up that's not possible you're gonna be saying that every week to G we I know and and I think I said it last week didn't I I said that you know of all the players this is the one player where you think maybe it can be sustainable because he's he is a machine hence the title of this show this week um but yeah I don't want to spend any more time on Watkins we talked about WIA that's a cool blow obviously got I mean I was never going to play scor and then went off injured yeah he was not going to get in my 11 until gameweek six but I bought him with that I bought him for the immediate game which he got me a return in then I thought I Ben sh for a couple bring it back in six I him for the lovely run probably double up onmo uh here's a question for you with whist out any impact on inmo yeah I think so because they've got such a good partnership haven't they that's that's really evolved over the last over the last couple of Seasons obviously Tony had the ban at the start of last season um they they kind of were forced into that that kind of partnership Tony came back was really ineffective brenford struggled Tony's out again and then bu V both started really well again and he's a really really good player V loads of energy he can finish causes defenses absolutely tons of problems as well um also it lets aumo D drift out right which he's really effective at doing and and kind of coming in from the from the right I wonder if's going have to stay a bit more Central now I what happens D and Sharda Sharda comes in well that's what that's where the smart money is going isn't it and I think that um maybe carvalo could play a could be a factor in this I I I wonder whether car after last night's performance somehow found a place in that team because he's a quality player isn't he I mean yeah yeah so I I don't know whether some system can be built around carvalo as an option by Thomas Frank I just don't know um but at the moment it'll be shardow will start down the middle I guess with with and bumo playing off him and maybe Cal comes in into a Midfield role but um yeah we'll get one I mean this is if you're wild card in Wild Card six I don't know if you'll have enough information to make a decision on brenford in terms of is vandenbberg an option is sharder an option is Cavalia an option maybe we need a bit more data before we can commit but I guess you can move to them when it sorts itself out there's no doubt though the brenford run is so strong that you want get on it though right is Sher an option at 54 in Midfield yeah I I think so I think that if you're brave and you commit the Wild Card this week or next then it's worth going for I think because so the fixes is just so good I mean he's not a prolific goal scorer he's not really a central striker in my opinion two goals is the most the most he's ever had in the league it could be worth going for because I think that you know it'd be nice I think you can take a risk on a couple of of of gambles and how big a gamble would it be because I think he will start and I think he'll start down the middle for a team with good fixture so I like it I like the idea of it yeah you're getting a 54 out position midfielder with let's say let's say you wild C in six with West Ham and Wolves at home they're Manchester United and ipswitch if you're going to take a punt on someone and then you know move off a highly owned player like Smith row even Rogers um someone like that then he might be someone to to consider Kevin sharder look at I was talking about him uh xery I was impressed with he's fourth on the on the list he how he didn't come away with a return against Southampton I I don't know he he looked really Lively and and interesting but again I'm not sure we're going to be risky I mean how much is he in in fbl is he about six million six and a half he he was he started his season at seven million I I he didn't turn up with the reputation as a prolific goal scorer he's more um you know he plays he play a role in the buildup he's he's somewhat creative as well and I think that you know hland is the goal scorer um and zeri is just a different option and I think we can see that right I don't I don't think he's going to attt investment when there's Midfield options from United that's the problem yeah I it was one of those games all right I saw the highlights of it and it's just every highlight seemed to feature Zury in some way it was you know we don't fully trust him yet but he's someone who might emerge for us a bit later in the season um he's someone I've now put on my radar when I hadn't really thought about it but maybe it was just the kind of like Southampton effect and you know we need to kind of be a bit uh you know be a bit bit bit less warm on it um anyone else you want to talk about here was well every time we got to talk about we've got to talk about calv lein Dr David yeah 1963 he's very very popular 5.9 million I'm seeing loads of transfers in for him uh just to come back to the fixtures again I mean the fixtures for Everton are unbelievable B Leicester Crystal Palace Newcastle both at home IP switch Fulham Southampton West Ham brenford man united wolves that's right up to gameweek 15 don't play any top six teams until game we 15 yeah it's crazy isn't it and and they will have to score goals and to be honest like in attacking terms they have had spells long spells in games where they've looked convincing I mean him and McNeil um there is no reason why you you shouldn't consider them with that run of fixtures I mean McNeil I don't think we touched on in midfielders he's 54 I believe and so could be an alternative in that no players created more chances in the league 17 chances yeah yeah so those two we should talk about them my only fear is obviously the levels of confidence in the Everton camp and how long is it before it starts to tell on the output of the attackers as well um c l on pens as well though so it sound I mean you know we're scratching round at the moment are we with the Visa injury that does seem to be the most obvious replacement Chris Wood could be as well though because I do think obviously Forest to grow in as a force and we've got decent fixtures and you know he could score you were you were last week yeah why not in that bracket and the other player to mention is inia because I do think he's 5'9 um maybe if you don't have eza it's an option I don't know if I double up on ezza and and CER but United and Everton I think it's only he got his first goal for the club last night it's only a matter of time before he scores in the league so he's another option so there are there are choices there to move Visa out to Evan nilson as well maybe in that bracket too yep none of them none of them are really go-tos none of them are obvious and maybe calv L is the most obvious because of what we know in the past and the fixtures so yeah I'm I'm behind it but I think if I was wild carding I'd probably look to probably go with Watkins and Harland and a four five probably if is what I do I don't know if I'd go fre Strikers yeah I mean I think I still think J Pedro is the one if he's if he's fit 5 five I still think that's you know incredible value obviously there's a moon is problem for a lot of people who who started with him after his what 40 shots and and no goal um of all the players we've talked about today you know you can have patience with players and I mean Seb still got in kungu so you never know what what might happen but Moes is the obvious sale for me if you've got him because yeah him has came in and scored and you have got options now you know to move you could move down to caval you could move to vardy um for example you could move to Pedro if you haven't got him Evan nson like you mentioned there were options around that that bracket so if you've got moones I think that's quite a quite an easy sell um if I had mes I'd be taking a pun on cavalon although he's is ill at the moment yeah that's it the thing is with c as well it's the fitness isn't it is he just finds a way of breaking down and so you can look at that fix run and think well he's going to be great for that fix run but you cannot take anything for gron with his Fitness because we've seen it year after year haven't we yeah dap's going to be an option for us at some point this season I I I really like him I really really like him and when I switch gets some slightly better fixtures I think he's gonna start scoring some some goals I reckon he'll get I'm gonna I'm gonna go optimistic I'm say he gets 12 goals this season what for C lein no deap dap maybe but between 10 and 12 goals maybe get double F it's very difficult for a promoted Striker to get double figures but you you really rate him do you I like him I like him I thought was built was buil as the as the goal scorer maybe but dap may be more as a battering R but yeah maybe I mean he's looking very direct he's got a lot of threat pace and strength so it's whereever it's which can make the most of the better fixtures but um I think between eight and 10 might be ambitious yeah minutes minutes are a bit of a concern as well because he was again he was subbed early against Brighton um just a lot just a lot to like about him uh right anything else on forwards we move on no I will say that the data has been wrong tonight um so it has been spotted in chat and I spotted it as we go so the xgi column is not correct so I don't know what's gone wrong with that so apologies and I will post the proper calculations post podcast um so sumit's gone wrong in the calculations they look right no they're not there's no way harland's got 2.28 xgi non penalty per 90 right so something's gone wrong there so I mean the the the order is right in terms of probably the xgi tally but not the totals in that column it's not been right for any of the table so apologies for that oversight very difficult very very difficult to get it right after work sometimes when you when you've got up against it so I will check them and put um new tables out on Twitter post release to get when I say they look right I mean like they look logical like none of them look they look logical but the numbers aren't right the calculations so something's gone wrong in the XL calculation so yeah I've been spotting it all night thinking that can't be right and it's been spotted in chat as well so apologies for that um but I don't think anything's misleading I think like the order of the players is probably AB that's what I mean yeah and obviously the other data is it's just the XG non penalty per 90 column I don't know what's gone wrong I need to look at it so apologies for that Nigel he's fuming yeah on mute oh no Mark's gone to beat up Nigel poor Nigel he doesn't he doesn't deserve that uh that's it for forwards while Mark is gone I just want to talk about sleeper who obviously the sponsor of Black Box uh this season um interesting one this this time out if anyone listening to this is uh looking at becoming a form of content creator for their club or has any interest in making social media posts making videos doing all that kind of thing s actually got a paid opportunity to do that it's called the 12 voice there's a link in the description uh into this video and essentially you can fill out an entry form um you can send over to sleeper and they're looking for people or fans who are of clubs uh to do social media posts uh to um to do videos to do all different content around around their own their own club I debated entering it for Brighton and then thought I'm already doing enough cont know you're the same Mark yeah there's no way I'm doing because obviously I do Forest Focus as well and Planet fbl correspondent um but yeah it's really good and we'll see we'll see who comes forward hopefully some of the FPL Community volunteer for that because it'd be really good to see some of the some of the names representing their clubs I mean we know there really knowledgeable people out there for their Club so let's see who comes forward so yeah and is like as I said I did the forest um pod you know talking about Brighton and talking M about the match up and you know if you if you know a bit about about your about your Club there's nothing better than just getting a platform to talk about them and you know talk about your views and and things so yeah give it um have a look at the link fill out the application if you're interested and you might be the next content creator uh for your for your club uh let's take a look at some fixtures then this is our predictions for the week coming up they all pretty similar again Mark we're getting a bit I know I not too bit too similar with these I think you moved the uh You' moved the garden center game from forest Brighton up to West H I think you're probably right I know well I believe you made the garden center game Forest I was take that went straight off when I saw that no chance I I I do think the uh yeah the the West Ham Chelsea game is probably the better option I'll give you that yeah well we'll start with them we start with West Ham Chelsea they are the garden center game I'm keep that logo on for the whole whole time we're talking about it I might just move over a bit because it's a bit not Center it annoys me hang on um but yeah what would you make of this I mean I this is one of the few ones we've gone different I've gone for um a West Ham win uh in this one I Bournemouth I don't know how Bournemouth lost that game to Chelsea it was a real kind of dingdong of a match yeah I mean 14 bookings 14 yellows I I was like and it wasn't really a filthy game it was like little niggly fouls but I mean he just it just ran away with him full te bookings and it did take the edge off it it was a horrible game to watch um Palmer I was watching throughout thinking come on come on convince me convince me I need pay attention of you and no just wasn't there yeah and Chelsea very much a work in progress managed to get through it a bit of quality Bournemouth again were unlucky not to get more from the game um and I thought they deserved at least a point from it so Chelsea Smash and grab a bit really and kungu ironically Off the Bench and I don't know I I don't know what to make of Chelsea how long is it going to take before we start in them I think it's going to be weeks yet isn't it yeah I mean the player I was most most impress with Sancho when he came on I thought that is that is what Manchester United have been crying out for ever since you signed and I haven't seen any performances from him in the Manchester United shirt like like the 45 minutes he put in for for Chelsea um for his really quick feet really direct creating loads of chances Defenders couldn't get near him half the time so been to see if he can if he can nail down a a spot in the team but did you hear him after the match uh it was moresa talking about he's like I've said to enu and and Mada and Sancho and just listing all these players and none of them are guaranteed like Jesus Christ 12 players you've listed mentioned ju Hall who hasn't got a sniff either and it's like it's it's got to be a bit of a mess isn't it I mean mesa's probably G obviously got to put a front on but it's it's horrible and and I just hope Palmer can come through it and be what we need him to be because he's a and I love him he's a great player and I don't think he'll hit the Heights in next SE last season but hopefully he he can still emerge from the chaos that is there and be an option yeah yeah anyway that's our guarden Center game I've gone for a West Ham when you've gone for a one0 Leicester Everson big game there's two big relegation kind of teams uh two relegation matchups this this week uh I've gone for a Leicester win uh 2-1 you've gone for a two if Leicester do win this D could be packing his bags you think so already well could be I think there's a very real chance they could win it I mean you've gone two1 I've gone two all I think that I can only think as a game of goals I I don't trust I defense I think Evan got enough in attack to cause Leicester problems and you don't need much to cause Everton problems it seems defensively um why are they playing Michael Keane all the time when they've got O'Brien I just don't know I mean that's not helping D's calls because the everon fans can see it and Kean was obviously at fault for the Watkins goal and I don't know and obviously D knows Keane from his Bernie days so is there is there too much faith in him there yeah I think you might be right I mean they're are they're starting to ask questions aren't they but U it depends on the nature of the defeat if they lose two or three nil then yes but yeah yeah squeaky win for Leicester you still hope that D has got enough in the bank to keep his job yeah true uh Liverpool Bournemouth Liverpool looking to bounce back another trip to another trip another trip another game at anfield for them to bounce back against the Bourn side who were going to play very differently to Forest um obviously much less focused on defense I think it's going to be again quite an open game for them which I think will suit Liverpool I've gone for a couple of goals to Bournemouth I've gone for three2 here you've gone for 3-1 yeah I mean what's behind that you just you just think they're going to allow goals all of a sudden I I think the I think the Liverpool defense is strong I think Bournemouth have got a lot going forward and in terms of pace and power they could maybe catch Liverpool so I think they might get one and I've gone 3-1 I think they will bounce back I it's hard to believe with the quality they've got that they won't that they'll fall foul again and and get a a negative result which will be you know a negative result be a draw yeah but I I I do worry I mean like I came out obviously came out the forest win delighted but also concerned that are they going to be our team's going to be able to repeat what Forest did and you know obviously there'd be a lot of teams looking at that and thinking well there's a blueprint there that we can copy and there are possibly teams better equipped than Forest to do it as well so I don't think bfar no I don't think bfar gonna do that no they'll press they'll press and they'll try and use their pressing to win the ball up the field I think that of all the I think I've seen data recently that shows that Bournemouth the bre you had the most success pressing in advanced areas this season so they'll rely on that to try and get them chances and it might it might work but I think Liverpool are good enough to play out of that and catch them so I've gone 31 yep uh you've also gone 3-1 in the Southampton ips switch game we' both gone for an IP switch win you've gone for three goals for IP switch I've gone for two and just the one for for Southampton um again tricky one to to call I just think I've been more impressed with it switch so far despite the fact they've had quite quite tricky games um they're going to be better at keeping it at tight at the bat because SE Hampton are just too a side at times you know trying to play out from the back and if have got that threat up front but three 3-1 would be a real marker for rip switch I think in this in this one yeah I I I just think they've got it in them and I I worry about Southampton um I just is what we thought you know the moment Russell Martin doesn't appear to be changing things up and he tried to go back four against United still got turned over by three goals and I just don't think they're good enough um they've lost Stevens now to a suspension so Howard Bellis will come back in but you know i' look at their defense and just I mean ramsdale has made a difference and will make a difference and will keep that try and keep their goal conceded tally down but I just think he's got to thank this task I don't think defensively they're strong enough and they're exposed I I do like Flyn Downs I think they've got some good players around him but they haven't got enough and and you know I've seen what it takes firsthand to stay up and I look at Southampton and just think I just don't see it I don't think they're strong enough yeah I know it's a bit less important for us now what because you know in previous Seasons when when we known that we're going to Wild Card in in six say um you dead end your team don't you you you you make sure you you use a transfer so you don't lose it whereas you don't lose it this time so you can bank and then and then wild card but if I was Den ending the team this week I think Leaf Davis would be someone that I'd I'd look at because obviously I've got Robinson at home to Newcastle I think Newcastle score in that game uh looking at 4.5 asset I think you could go for one of suara or or or Davis don't mind it going forward Davis prob be the preference yeah definitely I I I do think I'd make it switch the favorites for this game um and yeah both of us have gone for a way win and so if I was going anywhere that' be yeah be that be where I go i' go Leaf Davis but there are there are home games to come that's where it switch and Lea Davis are going to be most effective just faned him because I just think they they've got more about them than sampton and I just worried defensively about sampton yep uh Villa wolves the Midlands Derby I've gone for a 3-1 Villa you've gone for a 2 nil so both expecting it to be relatively routine you never really know what's gonna happen in these these sorts of games though it's just what impact is the European fixtures gonna have on Villa um they put a strong side out obviously last night they won the game how's is that going to impact them but I think the quality they've got and we've talked about the Wolves defense they will win the game it's whether or not wolves can catch them at the other end but we saw Villa's defensive data as being pretty strong so I've gone two nil I think it will be routine yeah so Watkins surely comes away with something from that then you'd hope it depends if he can get it in the first hour L doesn't it get that's a trouble right so yeah yeah good point I think he's a decent Captain option this week because you know you've got you've got obious got the Liverpool Bournemouth game with Salah looking you know so good but there isn't really a lot of other decent options I don't think from because obviously harland's playing Arsenal not really going to go for either of those I wouldn't have thought although if he didn't have Salah I probably would be tempted just to stick it on stick it on Harland but who else is there really maybe son at brenford if you've got him like you do might be an option yeah maybe he comes out well in the in the alos um is is the 60 Minute thing a problem maybe we're putting too much into that 80 he got 80 against against last night yeah yeah 60 okay fair enough so maybe but he got 80 because they were chasing the game though the thing the game state was suggest yeah so I don't know does it put eye off the C I know that James on planet fbl Captain him did well and he matched Highland so maybe you just ignore that and hope that his ex- mins goes up but Duran you can't he's not GNA leave Jan on the bench is he that's the thing so yeah it's a problem but not cameras made the camera's a bit bigger for why not uh fullam Newcastle you've gone for a Newcastle win 2-1 I've gone for a a one all I was quite surprised you went for a Newcastle win as you you've been quite quite down on their performances I just think Barnes will start I think they've got enough in attack and again I think the quality will win out but I yeah I'm not not hopeful of like an eak hall or anything here um I I just want to see them playing with a lot more Rhythm and fluidity and that bit of Verve and you are right Perhaps it is just a c ity gz Jo Linton is there creativity you'd think garez is creative enough but the yeah trippier did bring so much you're absolutely right he was he was such an outlet for them in terms of their buildup play and his delivery was first class and the liento doesn't bring that so is that what they're missing yeah you might be on to something I think what you want to see if you know with liento and and hall or whoever is okay they lose a bit of creativity but are they like a better defensive unit are they more solid I don't really think they are either I think teams still still feel like they're able to to get at them um particularly you know when when they're playing away from home uh so yeah I've gone for a drawing that uh Spurs brenford I've gone for a 3-1 but Spurs are struggling to score goals they're struggling to convert the chances that's do pretty dominant displays against Leicester where they couldn't score dominant display against Arsenal in the first 30 minutes couldn't put the ball away um slanky got 90 minutes but son looks a bit off it Madison hasn't really been performing um yeah I've gone for three but maybe a bit MB hope ful than than logic I think they squeak it I wouldn't be surprised see Bren forgets on it though um and Anie is just like going further and further into despair isn't he with every game oh he was very post match give it a rest please you know um you you've got to be I don't know I I think you you say a lot don't you people you tell a lot about someone's character in adversity and the minute Spurs started struggling his postmatch and his the way he treated his media just went really downhill from what it was I really loved his arrival at Spurs and what he brought and some of the character he showed and some of the things he was saying then he lost all that the minute Spurs started struggling and it's carried on this season he's been so sour um postmatch and don't know why you have to be like that I mean I get it that he's it's a very difficult job to do when You' just lost a game to go in front of the press and the media but other managers manage it right I saw our manager Steve Cooper have to do it every week because we were losing many many games and he never treated a media like that and I know perhaps he's not under the same kind of pressure but there were degrees right and I I don't like it and it makes me think well if he's like that for the cameras and the media which we're all seeing what is he doing behind the scenes that we don't all see you know and you know it's not good it's not good and I'm starting to worry that he's job is isn't n secure because I would never have said this six months ago I thought he was doing a fantastic job and he was the player a manager to take Spurs forward but they're really struggling aren't they and some of the stats coming out now about his win rate and the recent run starting to be worrying so they I think they'll do enough here but an needs to get more from that team there's no doubt yeah I saw I saw quite a good post about him which which said when he first joined a lot of the media treated him almost like a bit of a Ted lasso character you know like he's that kind of Plucky Underdog he's come from Australia he's inherited this team he's going to turn them around and all this and he hasn't he obviously isn't playing up to that or doesn't want to play up to that or whatever because like you say the way he talks to journalist I mean sometimes he did he does get asked some stupid questions um and you know but the way he responds to them I don't think is is a good way of is a good way of responding to them and like you say you talk about Cooper I thought Cooper was very classy the way he responded to to the media um and yeah posu hasn't really got the reputation to be able to get away with the way he talks at times no because pep does it doesn't he pep pep can be a little bit spiky with the press and when he's asked a silly question he makes it known it's a cly question well but you know I just don't I don't it makes you feel uncomfortable and if you support Spurs do you want your manager to be like that do you do you laugh it off or do you start going being a bit of an [ __ ] isn't he yeah yeah it would start to worry you I think because you you think well if he's like that there it's obviously getting to him he hasn't got the resolve to take defeat and take adversity and not let it show in how he comes across and as a leader and as a football manager that's a that's a weakness I would say so yeah it's a it's worrying I think the the way he talks in in terms of you know it's my second season I always win things in my second season look at the stats the way he's defensive about himself you don't tend to see too much you don't you know klopp had his moments where he was a bit of an [ __ ] but it wasn't really in the same defensive way you sort of marinho obviously because he was very very you know Arrogant with with with things and when he got questioned but I haven't really seen that with many other managers um so yeah have to see how he how he turns around it's not a great trait to have is it no it's not I me yeah we've seen it with a bit of slot as well a bit of arrogance you know he said about he's talking about losing to Forest being a disgrace it's like we are yeah that was that was that wasn't great that wasn't a great look yeah um yeah anyway uh Palace man united I've gone for my I'm sure I get slated for this I've gone for a palace win here two1 uh man united one all you you've gone for a draw I was just really impressed with the E and Kea Mata com I really really liked it I think it looks like they've been playing together for you know for years not and ketcher coming in for his first game and I think that's just given them the lift that they needed they've dealt with the Gaye stuff now that's all done results haven't been great but now they've got eneter in and he's giving him that that extra bit which they lost when obviously they lost to lisay um I think they have a little bit too much for Manu in attack they're still B new Defenders few injuries could be right you could be right I think that um it'd be good if that clicks I'm love Eddie I think he's great I wish Forest signed him so I do wish him well there and I think he could click in this game and the first goal is around the corner like I said so um yeah I can see I can see Palace tur them over I think it is the kind of fixtures where you the the the home style end get behind Palace there's a big atmosphere there and they've got goals in them for sure what United can do at the other end um I've gone a draw but maybe sit on the fence I do like the 2-1 next to the big one it's the big one next the Black Box Derby Black Box Derby yeah Chris Phillips says an arrow Brighton win as Phillip says an arrow Brighton win mark suin what a surprise says a forest win yeah I I I don't know I I mean you couldn't score against it witch so why do you think you're going to score against Forest I mean that's what that would be the simple question but I do think we can catch you as well I think we've got some threats and I do I mean you've got threats but the trouble is you know you talk about matoma but we've just seen how well Moro dealt with Salah so I don't necess think Mata is going to be as dangerous to us as as as he can be against other teams so I think defensively our fullbacks are really good in good form and our center backs are great as well we got caught one n at your place with a ridiculous setpiece goal last time out I don't think we'll get caught like that again and I do think going forward we're we're got we got some confidence and some weapons there so I think it'd be a really good game I really hope it is I think it's I think it's going to be a decent game to watch I don't know why I made it the garden center [Music] game I'm in a I'm going to Madrid this week and I know no no we we we we tried to get tickets but yeah it wasn't it wasn't possible I think we we were offered um to to go to Athletico to see Atletico uh play but I'd rather I'd rather see Real Madrid and I don't really want to miss as pathetic as it sounds I don't really want to miss Brighton V Forest I don't really want to miss Man City B Arsenal oh you're gonna watch the games when you're out there oh yeah but you gonna be there with your like noted hany and your Union Jack boxers in a in a pub watching the football no I'll be in my Brighton I'll I'll be full bright Kit full Brighton kit oh God as abroad do I want to know I know yeah it's not not great uh anyway that's the Black Box St that's always a good one Shane we still haven't been to see one in person no we can't do it we got to make sure we get to one and then we can do a vlog when we're there so I think it's February the 1 foresty Brighton right make sure you make it yes definitely we'll get you a seat don't worry we'll do Hospitality as I said we'll get Hospitality in the new you know we've got those new have you seen it the new um container things we've used shipping containers we turn shipping containers into a new hospitality suite it's pretty old it's as good as it sounds right but it's like 300 quid and I'm thinking yeah I'd do that for the Black Box I was about to say as a joke probably with the all owner to be about 300 quid and it say exactly how much he was 300 quid a ticket and I'm like let's give it a go I'm curious as to what it's like what in a match inside a shipping container it attach like a massive crane that like spins around that'd be fun oh it I'll send you pictures it's not pretty I mean there's pictures of what it's going to look like but it doesn't look like that at the moment and um yeah it's in the corner um I I don't really want to sit there but you know for the Black Box stby we should do it for a laugh it' be quite funny okay I'm in sounds good uh final game of the week is Man City V Arsenal we've both gone for an on the fence draw yeah i' come for a nil nil this just both teams don't want to lose nil nil you've got that's it isn't it because it's early in the season and my feeling is that you know arteta will go there and think okay we we're we're rice is back but OD guys still out would he take a draw there you've got to think he would right you've got to think you got to think this is a must not lose for both teams to yeah because it's about it's about the psychology of what that would mean for the winner and so if they're both going to go home thinking you know what it's I must not lose the likely outcome is a nil nil isn't it yeah um I've gone one all I'd like to think there is a goal in it but you could be you could be right if I was picking the fixture that's most likely to be nil nil it would be that one I think I agree um I mean you could maybe argue like sthampton ipswitch as well is a similar kind of must not lose um but I think both teams will mistakes I think yeah I think I switch will fancy the chances against so might attack a bit more um and yeah and obviously mistakes like you mentioned um was it which game was it last season when Arsenal absolutely dominated City and then still managed to lose it was that at the etti had or was that the City Arsenal I don't don't I don't know what I don't know where it was I can't I can't recall I think I think it was at the ettihad I think it was Aral went there and should have won it and ended up losing it and that was ultimately kind of what what cost him the the leag so I mean I'd love if Arsenal got a result I really would and I think it would be good for the premier league as well because I think that the pace at city is setting is already a little bit worry and it's a bit it's bit like I said about fbl it's like we want it we don't want it to be we don't want City to run away with it so the last result we want is a city home win Arsenal out you know push back and then with the odard injury that could impact them and psych psychologically as well losing this game so the best result for the neutral probably would be an Arsenal win yep yep if you want to get involved in the blackbox predictions uh obviously you can you can join our patreon there's still time to get in patreon.com blackbox we've got a website where we track all the predictions of all the members and ourselves uh we predicted 40 uh matches now Mark is currently in the lead but only by two points you get one point for a correct outcome three points for a correct score very close I've got slightly better out comes but you've had uh I think one or two more correct correct scores so there's not much it look at hottin though Ian we talked about him last week crazy 73% correct outcomes blood L is absolutely ridiculous um yeah what is he I mean hopefully I mean I don't want don't wish anyone to gamble but hopefully he makes some money out of his of his predictive Powers because that's crazy yeah yeah um yeah get involved if you're interested in that there still time um also join the sleeper pick him league as well that's correct outcomes uh too and monthly prizes or prizes worth up to £500 a month completely free to play Link in the YouTube description below Al an overall prize for that but yeah obviously get involved in that if you haven't already uh captaincy as I said interesting week uh this week uh Harland is top of all the metrics no surprise but has the hardest game the Daya is wrong in this as well the xgi is still wrong in this by the way we won't mention that we don't need I figured out what I did I figured out what I did by the way um in in my workings I basically added XG to xgi rather than XA to XG so the columns were wrong and that was caused by the cost tab malaky that I spoke to you about so I will correct it I will correct it updated tables so off it won't happen again and I know exactly why it's happened and apologies yeah every week I hear about that cost that cost tab in in Scout it's caus you no end of problems isn't it yeah it's fine it's it's fine I've sorted it now um it it's on on the chart anymore don't worry don't wor yeah it's fine um it's Salah isn't it I mean is there a conversation here around that I mean most managers now have got Salah even with Harland there in their team most have moved that way as well um if you don't Salah you probably would go Harlem wouldn't you let's face it I think it's Watkins Harem Salah that's the three do you Sal what have we got what have we got in The Matrix for this week bring that up let's have a look I think I probably had those three as well son okay so Salah Watkins son yeah I don't know I don't know if we saw enough on son though no I mean you you think his Spurs win son should get a return at of that um because you know he's on pens and he is Central to their attack he's not Central literally because he's playing out left but yeah I think it's it's because of what harland's done so far if you don't have Sal it's it's very difficult not to say that harland's not the second choice right yeah um I mean next week as well you know we haven't got harand highlighted here he he probably is entering into that that bracket but I mean salah's got sack's got Leicester Watkins has got ipswitch again that's a three great yeah you you would think that those three are stronger Captain C options in Harland in a normal EnV situation but it's just what we've seen so far is just ridiculously yeah crazy and then look at that run though look and gameweek seven onwards it's hard to question captain in maybe brighten away but you are definitely going to Captain Harland Fulham wolves santon Bournemouth I would Bri away yeah yeah there you go yeah so this is why the you know I haven't got Harland yet I've got to think about wild cards in in I game week six or certainly game week seven I think because of that run and the Damage he can do in that run is pretty considerable I thought and when where did you go to the captaincy you get to game with Kate and it's a problem yeah I mean this is your team for for the next game week um you mentioned the wild card as well you got that on the on the radar um but yeah let me know your what's your thoughts what you thinking well I think I don't think I do anything this week um I don't necessarily need to un unless I hear obviously isach or xia Pedro are out um because I think that I'm not booking in the the wild card game week six if I was I dead end something into game week six it might be that I'd take two transfers into six and then get Watkins and mumo in for son and wiissa right which I could um and then go without Harland at Newcastle and and hope that sacka covers the captaincy which he could do so I think what I'll do is not I'll probably hold this so it's reyya coner Trent Pedro poo sacka e Salah son Rogers isak and Jal Pedro if that 11 are fit I'll probably just go in with that save the transfer and then decide whether I Wild Card next week and take the extra transfers through or whether I make transfer next week and wild card ahead of seven y but I could I I've looked at Wild Card this week I don't think it's worth it I don't think I want to move to Harlem when he's got Arsenal so it's more likely I do it in six when he's got Newcastle or seven when he he's got Fulham at home I think he's he's probably the likely outcome so I don't really see a transfer here I mean I could do wher to calv lein I've got not one in the bank but then who do I who do I pull out maybe xia Pedro if he's not going to be fit there's talk that he wasn't training today again so um I don't know what you what do you make of that what would you do there yeah I think if there's doubts around lak and and Pedro going into the weekends I think I would probably look to move wher out and have that as a good because you don't really your team no offense isn't looking that strong this week um and you know if G Pedro's gonna miss out and Robinson's gonna come in I'd think I'd much rather have an option of a calv lein or or a vardy in case that was that was going to happen um but yeah it's I mean the thing is the only major difference between my team and other people's is harand playing Arsenal because most most Harland teams have got well they most Harland teams have got Salah but they haven't got sacka so it's only looking I don't don't know I dispute the fact it looks weak because in a all week it would because harland's got GNA score goals but it's not true and there not yeah so I don't think it looks weak because it's as good as any other team the only thing that's missing is Harland playing Arsenal which I don't know you could say well that's a major problem but I'd like to think it isn't because of all the games against Arsenal I would say that that could be the one where I can think well he's only gon to get one goal maximan so I don't think it's weak I think it's okay um but the problem I've got is my differentials are sacka and son and I don't see necessarily see son getting me anything and sacka probably won't do anything either because he's playing City so I don't have anything there that's going to help me make up ground because people have got har got Sol so I might get a green arrow but it's not going to be it's not going to be a game which helps me make up ground so I I accept that but I don't think I'm going to lose ground unless Haren goes crazy Sur which he could I mean this is it he could so I think that yeah it all depends on whether those flags come off I think saaka will be fine because he's playing tonight right so um I think isak's fine because just blur Vision so I don't think that's a problem unless it was concussion and it's xia Pedro really and if yeah if Shia Pedro's out I'm tempted to do it anyway because I don't necessar think Brighton are going to score many goals against that's what I was about to say are you not tell just to get rid of the whistle problem and bring in another cheaper Striker I mean it's caval Zill though isn't he so you've got that yeah so he's flag as well is yeah yeah or it's V or it's who was the other or would bringing bring you bringing in Chris be the ultimate turnaround yeah I I just I just think I'd rather have the two transfers next week and then decide that gives me the option to wild card or not whereas I they use a transfer this week I've kind of got a wild card next week I think yeah yeah that's true because I'd be going s in bumo and having three million in the bank and I don't really want to do that yeah whereas I if I have two transfers I can go s and bumo Wier to Watkins and that is then a team where I can go well maybe I can go about Harlem one more week and and hope that sacka Watkins they they will be differentials I mean or Salah could be a differential because you think that many teams are going to go Salah to sacka don't you so I could have a decent team with two transfers next week that makes me think I haven't necessarily got go Harland but he could destroy Newcastle can he this is the thing he's like it he's dominant and and it's a shame because yeah it does limit our our possibilities a bit now yeah um well I'm I'm in I'm in a similar dilemma of when I'm going to when I'm going to walk card as well cuz I think my team actually is all right for game week six um I probably won't have S well I won't have sacka unless I sell sell but I can get to an Arsenal um Defender so I've got Henderson in goal with Trent porro and Robinson uh Salah Captain jotter Gordon Rogers Harland mateta who was a problem I thought might be a problem for me he's now actually I think quite a good good asset out nowhere and and G Pedro and then I've got Smith row on the bench who can come in if if Pedro is is out um my first thoughts were to were to roll earlier in the week um and then I could do Salah to sacka and tedson to Raya for two threee trans for two free transfers um that means losing Salah against wolves but gets me two Arsenal players at home to it's Southampton first isn't it and then and then Lester yeah which which I like the look of but I am thinking that jotter is a problem so I could do jotter to mumo and then I'd still have the money to do porro to next week yeah next week yeah so I would I would role this I mean you're playing Robinson at home to Newcastle which is probably the only weakness here really um CU if xia Pedro's not fit he got Smith row so there's not there's not any other weakness there I would say other than maybe jotter but we just don't know how that's going to go do we it's he loves him but there there is a threat there now yeah for sure yeah do do I do I give J one more week or do I bring in inoma who I'm going to want anyway from from game week six well you give J this week I think you think I'll give him this week I would because he's G to get a Le Le half an hour yeah true and boomo at Spurs could he could he could do well at Spurs I mean that's the thing it's but yeah I would I would probably hold jota for this week see what happens yeah I I do like the idea of getting Ry in for Henderson because then that gets rid of that goalkeeping problem gets me gets me the the Arsenal Defender who I want the most um selling Salah isn't ideal but I'm getting in saaka who's let's be honest a pretty good replacement with the two home games he's got so yeah but then I'm still on to J so if J's then a problem from from next week then it might be wild card time because that'll be three transfers um and I can get rid of Robinson I can clear up my bench a little bit Yeah you got Johnson there when are you gonna play it if you don't play it next week I know so it could it could and and I like the fact that I could I can keep the two three transfers and still play it now and still keep those two three transfers was obviously in previous years I'd be decid you know I'd need to make a transfer this week and then then wocks I couldn't hold and then and then wild card so um oh it's Leicester before Southampton first so it's a slightly you know not it's the slightly worst game of it two but yeah still still pretty good I'm probably Gonna Roll anyway both us rolling brilliant both us rolling fun all that all that all that analysis and yeah we're both uh we're both rolling um that's pretty much it from us we've got a couple of super chats uh to answer it uh we've got this is just um a message from super duper FC who's been a member for 30 months of the YouTube channel uh thank you very much he says Yellen and Mark's Vlogs are the weekly entertainment yellers are good I really like some of her transition she uses very clever she's got lots of ideas and um yeah it's good it's good I mean I I enjoy doing I think like we both got the same camera aren't we so we both use the same God she loves it she hasn't got the Drone though yeah I've invested in a little drone to help me do the the GTA type shots behind me which is is kind of cool um but yeah so I'll be doing it I've got to find a spot in Brighton on Sunday morning so I'm looking forward to doing it in Brighton see where I can do didn't have she didn't have any time when she went because we were so late so so there's no footage oh God no it's the only thing about it is it means I spend Monday night editing the video which means Tuesday night I'm rushing doing the data and then I get the XG data wrong so that's my fault so I need to sort I keep say teach me how to do the tables and I can help out but yeah I know I know we'll sort out so I that's rattled me tonight getting that wrong because it's the first time it's happened I don't think we've ever had the data wrong like that so apologies I will get correct we have oh thanks very much because you were rattled then it's very rare don't get me wrong but it has it has Fair it's it's Exel it's so easy to break yeah it is y uh new member atab boy thank you very much new member Nigel the crab don't really understand that left and joined again oh left and joined that's a understandable uh heroic doses thank you very much for the super chat um I get the rule but triple sub oh yeah here we go triple sub 5920 jotter gets one because he's off first Diaz gets three because he's off at 605 imagine they were Defenders FBO equals a clown show it is a ridiculous rule ridiculous I I think it should be when the ball goes up that's the minute 100% 100% because then it then it's about like who walks the quickest or who who furthest I was saying to pra well that's great great um marginal game because Diaz is obviously on the wing so therefore Jos has willing the sh distance but it shouldn't come down to that should it it's absolutely crazy did someone say it's just poor like x x steps or x x grass or something yeah um yeah I mean that's you're right I mean the swing for a Defender would have been massive wouldn't it and um yeah I mean like imagine Trent and Robertson and Robertson is over there and Trent's nearest so Trent goes off sooner Robertson makes it a bit of a distance and he gets a clean sheet that it could happened because he he's taken them both off he took them both off at his didn't he I think at the end yeah he did so you know it you know I mean they wouldn't go off on 60 Minutes maybe but it is still a very silly rule so do it when the ball comes up not when the player steps over the line it's yeah got I mean I I've won I've won two leagues in the past by one point one against you and one when I was in the cash League years ago I know that's the point that's the two points yeah and I was robbed of that because of the edit an assist did you have to bring that up again I thought that was awful on Saturday no harand got that second goal and I thought oh who got the assist bloody Edison of all they rubbing it in they gave it straight away as well Ming around no doubt yeah course maliky Fox thank you very much hi as a Mark Jackson to calv lein for a hit not for a hit no I'd keep I wouldn't want Jackson particularly but if you've got him I'd keep him not for a hit yeah I I just don't think I mean like I said the dcla gets the fitness it's um yeah longterm I worry about him getting match after match after match and so um I think he's good for a couple of weeks um but as you know he's ear already so what's behind that you know I want to you need to get a bit of that before you know for sure but it's the hit it's the Four Points you you you're putting pressure on to score one straight away which he's not that prolific that you can do that yep no I agree not for me uh and the final one is from P Lassen again thank you for the Super Chat should I do vardy to wood or hold wood longterm I guess it means wood to vardy or hold W no I'd keep wood yeah so I um I think that aan is still some time away from being the starter and um I think wood can cause you a few problems and um yeah we'll create for him he's not brilliant in the buildup but he's there to finish things and we'll create for him and we' got some good fixtures to come so hold him for sure y uh at boy says like the stream Lads and gals is a small effort but for as Mark very helpful y if you haven't liked already do give us a like do drop us a comment yeah and if you are listening on podcast give us a festar review if you've enjoyed it because again those this is the place I'm reliable XG data so where else would you rather be than watching two men talk about wrong XG days some Grand people moaning that fbl is broken because he had a bad game week that's what you want right that's it yeah well I don't really like your team this week so I don't think you're going to be that happy next week thanks a lot I don't know I don't understand who what team looks much better than that I mean yeah mil it sorry yeah I I don't think it's no I mean Watkins maybe could go off um yeah I know to be fair is I don't think it's going to be a very high score scoring week so you you'll probably get away with that no probably not I mean yeah it depends how that Arsenal City game goes doesn't it because we are reliant on those assets really reliant on those assets um you know without Ry and sakur have done really awfully without harand lot of managers would have done awfully so it shows you how alarm we've become on Arsenal and City already this season so um we'll see I I think Salah will come good I think I think there'll be points in that game for everyone who's on Salah um but um I'm not holding my breath for summer returns but we'll see stranger things have happened they have yeah well and I would say good luck in the black boox Derby but I don't mean it get um I will be messaging you um so make sure you get your phone sorted out in Madrid because I want to be able to send you photos on the ground of us celebrating [Music] and I wish we go together good game yeah a good game nice that it's getting closer between the two teams because when we came up the the thought of sharing the match with you watching Forest getting beaten but now I think actually by the time we actually get to it like you come to the city ground I think that's going to be really I think it's tight now between our teams so yes do I I am proud that Forest have made progress and closed the Gap a bit and you never know you made the Europa League maybe we can maybe we're not too far away either we'll see yeah I think Matt said to me where do we think we finished and I said probably like ninth and 10th it's probably realistic good good yeah be right with that Mark absolute pleasure as always I'll see you again next week enjoy the game well I hope so unless I have another miserable game week then I might retire and uh oh no don't say that have to do it bloody handy kind of that this all good yeah it's all good thanks right I'll see you again good night for me night everyone

plenty of things to plug this episode anyway im in im in control today of streamyard last time last time we did this everything was very fuzzy if everythings fuzzy again there isnt much we can do

fuzziness that are on screen then but well move on to fbl now no ones saying anything about the fuzziness is fun this thing is fun lets talk about game week four then lets start with you im sure youre desperate to talk i cant see it as sorry thats far too fuzzy i cant make it out you panic me then for a second2 points de i read for it ry nine points thank god for rya trent one coner one lewis one robinson 2 i know its w all over again sacka 7 rogers 2 e2 is my transfer in for smith row who did better than eza salah with the fail the captain se on four son two isak one off at half time of course so a lot of teams were popped up by harland i dont have harland so i couldnt be popped up by that salah blanked for the first time this season so what are you going to get when harand returns and salah blanks and you havent got harland youre going to get a bad game week luckily sacka and reyer came in for me i i know and there were a lot of teams who had like the 26 points from harland and then blanks everywhere else wasnt there there were some crazy looking teams this week in that respect and why did so many players blank it was just it was just a very odd game week in that respect and harland papered over the cracks for a lot of managers i watched the forest liverpool game live dont ask me how because i wasnt there i did turn down a ticket to go as well this is terrible what would you do in my shoes here so i had a friend who i met at forest text me on friday night and he said if i can get you a ticket do you want one and i thought to myself well im going to brighton next week this week and im going to fulham the week after i cant go into pip and say what do you think can i go to liverpool and then go next week to the brighton game and then the week after the full i thought shes not going to let me go to three games and i thought to myself whats the chances of us getting some at liverpool itd be a good nice to go up there and that i thought no so i dm him back said thanks for the offer but i better not i better do family stuff better not push my luck what happens the best away day in the history of like there were people on the forest focus pod that i do share with saying the best a day in memory and im like my god so what would you do would you go into pip and look at that look at the sacrifice i made i could have gone but i didnt even ask you cuz thats the guy i am or should i just forget it and leave it or should i bring it up in an argument in a few years time what you mark i know i know you and i know how much pit puts up with you i would i would strongly advise you do abs answer i wanted that is i thought i thought i deserve credit for that but im getting no credit and ive missed the best away day in forest history the thing is imagine if you taken it and got all the way up there and then you got thrash 30 but that was the more pretty big gamble it was and as big as going without harand and cin c in the first place anyway yes so luckily i got through the weekend boyed by the the victory at anfield and then it started to sink in as the hours passed that i had a miserable game week there were teams there were teams worse off than mine and ive just got to take it but now what im more down about is the way its going in the weve got palmer who struggled weve got sackos now got odard missing for probably a long time based on what we heard tonight is that doesnt sound great so weve got to assess is sacka gna be the sacker of last season now with oard missing for a long period of time probably not were still g to get him for the two home games but after that how long whats the impact of the odard injury on sacka watkins has done okay showed up last week so he could be an option but palmer sacka son i dont see them i dont see them justifying their price at the moment and i fear i thought sacka would but i wonder now so im fear that what were ending up with even though we started the season going theres so much choice there dilemas and everyones got different teams i fe were going to end up with salah and harland in all our teams two defenders and a load of four fes i do worry i do worry do you not think thats the way its going to go im not as im not as worried as about that because i think were were seeing in game week six were going to see people getting rid of salah and for the sacker home games and so what you think that in game week eight people are gonna go back to salah again i dont think i dont know and i think if youve got two arsenal defenders and trent and harland youre going to find it a bit different because were looking at players like boo you cant do that as well i dont know i think its i think we are i think game week six is going to be interesting because i think were going to see people move towards a lot of the same teams i think everyones team is going to be very similar in game week six and game we seven theres going to be a few people that because i cant i cant have sacka and salah for example game week six i dont think many can so well you cant your wild card to that you can probably walk to it what a harand sacka salah and trent and well you cant have two ar defenders as well no you cant have two ar defenders as well no so youd have to have but you can wild card to saaka salah trent and harland ive tried it ive looked you can i dont think im gonna be going with salah from game week im gonna wild card in either six or seven and id be surprised if my team ended up with seller in it so no it wont then but i think what will happen is well get sacka in for the two home games and then well start to see that arsenal perhaps a much more defensive team rather than a forward thinking team without odard and well start to think or maybe we dont need sacka maybe we go have it up top and that covers arsenal i just fear that the options that we we were giddy about this looks amazing harlands 15m so not everyones goingon to get him well thats going to go pair shaped and weve got other options like palmer and sacka and son and watkins and you cant have them all but i think already i feel like the pool is narrowing a bit what we need what we need is palmer to start pulling his finger out right that will that will cure it but i dont know i watched chelsea and i think i dont see it happening do you see it happening yet well on the on the big screen is the is the is the is the fixtures so the long the longterm view so lets assume game week six is going to be split a lot of people wont want to sell salah for wolves away but some people might have they w i think that might help and then liverpool have crystal palace chelsea arsenal brighton aston villa then its southampton in 12 but then its straight into man city and then newcastle away i dont think people are going to be moving back to salah for that run the only thing because this is the other thing thats going to be d is if people dont move back to salah because they just go well im only going to captain harand now and thats the how close are we to that after four weeks were going to look at harand start its absolut ridiculous after four weeks how close are we to perac cat in harland do you think were not going to get it this week because hes at arsenal but then i reckon even newcastle way i think were going to get people going id rather captain harland than captain sacka at home so i think even then were going to get question marks over do you do you not captain in harland even when sacas got plum fixtures so right i me man citys fixures from six and newcastle fulham wolf southampton bournemouth brighton tottenham youre going to cap him in all of those i imagine unless you go for the sacker option at leicester and southampton but then youre not and then its liverpool away in 13 but thats salah and harlem i know i know arsenal got west ham away spurs have got fulham at home that week so a son or salanki possibly son i just i dont know son out wide to me i own him and i from what ive seen he got me a couple of goals in game week two but i dont see him justifying that p st at the moment well see he might surprise us at home to brenford playing out wide but we know out wide hes not as effective as an asset i just think that already i feel because harlands just been ridiculous incredible right and we all thought 15m was a price tag to make people think well it probably isnt anymore is its not like hes 15 what hes three now and no ones going to blink at that so thats a shame straight away because hes been going to come the dominant heavy hitter and hes going to become the perma captain and so those two things straight away are going to start narrowing the difference between teams and then itll be whether or not you feel like having salah can you justify if you dont captain him or do you go sacka but i worry about the odard impact on sacka what we need is palmer and son to show that they can be justified at 10m and we need foden back to at least present some alternative to harlem we havent got that so its not been fbl did all they could with the pricing dont get me wrong i think they did well with that but unfortunately the way the season has started it hasnt lent itself to everyone having different teams yet i think its pushing people towards well youve got to have harland you might as well catch them every week theres question marks over having sal if you dont captain him question marks over sacka palmers not ready sons not good enough fodens not in the team that suddenly the pool is contracting its like thats not what i expected not what i wanted so its annoying me a little bit its the other way around to what we were expecting because we thought maybe with palmer and sacka competing with each other it would give you the option but theyre not competing with harland and salah at the moment so why would you go there what we need at the moment is for palmer sa to be competing with like lis diaz and th those types of players because theyre the ones where were were moving around salah and har at the moment going anywhere fodens the big one i think when come back and start hitting anywhere near the form he showed last season i think thats when people might but hes not in the starting lineup tonight again is he i thought he might be saved for europe but no the other thing is we need harand to stop scoring loads of goals but well heres anyway here my team im a lot less grumpy than you are had a okay week 59 points for me henderson in goal porro robinson and trent that was a disaster robinson conceding to a 95th minute danny in equalizer is just absolute peak fpl i bought in salah and pedro didnt play salah blanked i got smith row off the bench though and i tell you what i was worried going into sunday because i sold esack and sacka and when sacka got that assist and i still had esat left i thought i could be on the back of about a 20 25 point swing here but with smith coming off my bench i was about i was one point up on that move so one point up were you i thought you were still down on it okay because isac only got the one point didnt he he hea with the one sacka with seven smith row matched him and then sal with two its crazy is it look at your team right they obvious got mata but you only got two players a turn mata and smith row and smith row was on your bench so its was like so many teams just had either harland and one return or thats about it was i mea was a big differential for you so well done but took over as well luy lucky that happened cuz penalty in the in the 9th minute i just would have assumed a would have taken it and was the player i was fearing this week so very lucky with that im disappointed in rogers gordon and jotter all blanking would waker rogers its crazy and he played well last night as well and people are saying like is he is he gonna go on this ridiculous run of looking like the best player on the pitch in every game and not getting any returns and it is it is crazy its got to happen soon isnt it and theyve still got good fixtures left so youve got to hope that its going to drop for him soon but then the jan thing is all very weird i just dont know what they do again watkins subbed on 60 minutes last night little bit of on his leg i think hes all right hell start itll start the weekend but what does emory do with duran because durans like a immovable object at the moment you got to give him minutes havent you and were not just talking five and 10 youve got to give him a decent 2025 so i dont know does watkins come off every game and thats the only way or does he get can he get morgan rogers out wide and duran in with watkins does that even work i dont know i dont know because is playing well ramsays playing well durans playing well watkins isnt going anywhere its very tricky to know what i assume duran would start yesterday and against young boys i know it was their first champions league game in forever but i thought why not why not see i was i was quite surprised to see rogers play he got the 90 again didnt he last night rogers as well dont think he he did czy i didnt expect him to play i thought duran would start rogers wouldnt start but he just seems to youre quite right he loves rogers hes playing superbly but hes just not returning for us and i just dont know theyve got the caribo cup tie so we got to think that duran will start that so maybe that means that he doesnt have a big impact on watkins minutes at the weekend you cant bank on it i think what thats it i said that watkins is back and watkins is an option but if hes hes only ever played an hour so far in every game so like a we invest in a player thats only getting an hour because weve said before you want your striker on for stoppage time because we know the xg goes up around that period so its thats not great either is it so its like i dont know apart from harland and well see salahs had his best start to the season for a long time as well the other second tier assets just i dont know they need to do more they need to do more to make the season what we thought it would be and even jot for example j was my way about going against salah and that just hasnt and im worried about his potential to start because i thought gakpo played quite well yesterday and diaz is getting 60 70 minutes in the league almost every week as well thats not being talked about but hes hes not playing anywhere near 90 you see the comments as well from slot saying he was gonna play gakpo as well but he was tired from his min diaz flying around the world i know and jotter i dont know you talked about it last week didnt you is he is he in the firmino role and like did you see i dont know whether you saw j had hardly got the touch of the ball against for us like we shut him down completely and they just couldnt get the ball anywhere near him and apart from the one chance he did have their best chance but he was so quiet like he was just not a factor at all and so the system that slot is playing although it has got the best out of diaz and weve seen him step up ive never seen jotter have less impact than im seeing hes not playing a part in the buildup and theyre not getting theyre not getting supply to him so thats that is a worry because how long is it before gapo becomes a factor in the middle down the middle or even dare i say it darwin nunes i dont think darwin nunes is i think darwin isnt worry gone hes gone hes gone but thats one good thing to come from this season so far because we dont want any of that darwin had come off the bench and started making a bit of a case for himself i think there would be people going there but luckily its its not us gr and the goods on the screen lots of red arrows this week as you can see pra and harry both leading the way both on a red im on a green im one of four managers in the great and the good on a on a green i said i would id be happy with staying about where i was which was about 900k got a green up to 636 okay so im approaching my best rank in the last two seasons which was about 400000 last year its got to be one of your best starts for a while isnt it i think it probably is i think it probably is my best start for a while yes hopefully can build on that not so good for you we were neck and neck and now theres a what a 30 point difference between us im trying to remember the last time we did a 23 points when was the last time we did a black box where you were beating me the last episode of the end of the season one by one point i think i was beating you every week last season no i was beating you at one point because you ben to super nan right that was game week two that was the mat challenge so like youre beating me by 20 points thats thats the biggest evidence that f is broken of course right regardless of everything else ive said the fact youll beating me by 20 fbl is broken its gone gs gone late r exactly the same points48 i know and exact their teams are similar and theyve got harland like look at the start theyve had and theyve got harand so and i think they had harland from the start didnt they so like harlands not the silver bullet youve got to have a decent team around him as well and a lot of managers i think all the managers above me have got harland and salah now ready for ready for the forest game ironically a lot of people got him in for the forest game and and the games at bournemouth to come next week of this week of course so salahs not a differential for me anymore ive got to hope that son or sacka get me summit this week and then with odard out and sacka at man city probably not going to happen is it so i dont know i were talk about what im doing at the end of the show but its a grim read this even though theres a lot of harland ownership there a lot of red well shout out to seb who has got the same points as zar and late riser but hasnt made any transfers at all this season hes hes committed to this getting as many transfers stored as he can isnt he y and he got inu off the bench this week imagine making no transfers and still having inu if you are struggling if you are in the millions dont worry if you look at the table on the bottom youll be able to see that this season if you look at the great and the good average positions at this point this is the worst start the great and the good have had so i remember 22 23 that was a difficult season the average rank at this stage was 14m the average rank at this season is 2m look at it look at it in 2122 2 wow so at this stage we the average was 240k so almost every manager in the great good had a incredible start is that right wow okay i know no isnt it and team value is the lowest its been in the last four years 1005 its the transfers are about the same hit are about the same but those gw one teams just like you say havent performed and i think if you if you had harland and reyer you probably had a decen start to the season if you didnt have either of those then youre probably two or three million thats probably about how it how is right nothing wrong with being two or three million as nothing wrong with i looked back last year and i was 31m this time last year so just outside the top 10k right but i dont know i didnt enjoy last season at all despite getting 12k and a good rank i thought it was the most tedious season ever so im more im more about like is this going to be a season where its going to be twists and turns and it looked like it was going to be and i dont know i sound like a broken record and maybe its all going to perk up a bit in a few weeks maybe this week its going to turn it around sacka goes and gets a couple of goals and sun looks amazing and palmer comes good and all of a sudden everyone wants i hope so no we dont want that we dont we dont need any more of that as were about to see in a minute well well see right now so this these tables these tables are the are the starts after four game weeks the top 10 in terms of points per start so harland has led the way in each of the last three seasons after game week four he got six goals in four games last season he had six goals in four games the season before that hes got nine goals in four games this time out his points per start is 135 which is the highest probably the highest weve ever seen right it is it is there cant be players had nine in nine and four and its also officially his best four run of four game weeks hes ever had in those three seasons as well so hes beaten his personal best for that span of game weeks and hes beaten his best start ever this highlights what a strong starter we all is and fine we knew that but wow even pep said didnt he that hes surprised at what hes seen from him and its interesting isnt it that salah and holland are the top two and we were all saying before the season started well theyve had a rest theyve had the summer off and you can say its down to that it may not be but it probably was a factor in that theyre the two top scores salah on 43 points i think thats his best ever start as well i had to look at his past seasons and the scout data doesnt unfortunately have fb points right the way back to 2021 but his previous best in the last five years has been 38 points so he has he has had an incredible start as well for his by his standards he wasnt in the top 10 last season or the top 10 the season before i think he got 23 points last season at this stage and 25 the season before so hes almost doubled well not quite but hes you hes added 18 points onto last seasons tally at this stage that is amazing is it for a player as well in the last year of their contract getting on a bit in the league with all the competition around him with j with diaz with all these other amazing players and hes still 10 point 108 without harland that would be the best start freddy player in the last three years for sah but because harlands there its its equipped it diaz is on the list points of 88 that would put him that would also put him second i think to in the last two years thatd be higher than ino last year we rodrigos amazing star god i remember that i didnt get any of those any of those points but a great start for him got a shout out gabrielle and rea though i went into this with no arsenal defense whatsoever i thought games against brian games against villa game against spurs i could make do without a defender and try and get to six without one rey has just been unbelievable and the only other goalkeeper who features on his top 10 in the last three seasons amazingly is dean henderson i know forest and the irony of that because hes been bloody awful for people and ive got him in my team im looking at r who i want and looking at henderson thinking dear hes taunting you there because he saved a penalty for forest as well didnt he 22 in four games show you how difficult it is for a keeper to get in this top 10 its like hendersons in there because of a pen save and 22 saves so thats an incredible return of saves in terms of save points as well we would never expect ry to have 15 saves by now would we wouldnt expect him to have three clean sheets and 15 saves we might expect to have three clean sheets and five saves but not 15 and because hes got 15 saves hes also picked up six bonus points which again i dont know did he even get that many bonus points last season for the entirety of the season ill g have a look because gabrielle and c only got about six all season last season r got six bonus points there he go so hes already leveled his bonus points tally for last season in four game weeks thats and yet we were saying start of the season well you can forget bonus points for keepers well we were saying forget bonus points for keepers if they concede even if they make like 11 saves theyre not getting a bonus but it does look like if a goalkeeper keeps a clean sheet they are very likely to get at least one bonus point and he is they will get the most clean sheets this season but i would say hes in a team where because the other factors is shots on target and fouls one and perhaps arsenal havent done enough in those in those metrics to rival him and knock him out the bps like theyre not full of players who are having loads of shots and so well get to the attacking data later i dont think arsenal are in the top three or four teams there so perhaps and with oard out perhaps theyre not going to be maybe theyre gonna have to rely on winning games one on two nil but it works so why not shout out to mumo on here who is ninth on the list for this season with his two goals against southampton is his goal before that he was second last year after that great run before he had and that might be the move i look to do in that j to mumo move which is maybe a bit a bit earlier than i would have liked but might be might be sensible because he clearly gets off to good starts so want to one to monitor lets take a look at some team data then lets start with team data defense not huge amounts of changes from when we talked about this last week we got liverpool at the top then man city and then forest and i think talk to us about forest how on earth did they stop liverpool well i think that in ana and and moreno weve got th those two on anfield were absolutely fantastic the two of the best fullback performances ive seen from a forest team not just moreno he made six he won six of his seven tackles against salah didnt get much out of him at all and i knew at half time i was saying i think i tweeted i said i dont i just dont see sah getting anything because were just throttling them and every time salah gets anywhere near the ball morenos on him we were so aggressive we were right in their face and m movic and melo are just a great combination murillo very mobile low center of gravity milinkovic a bit of a brute strong in the air strong in the air and a leader so those two and the two fullbacks look it looks like a good defensive unit so i do think that we were top five for defensive data last season i think or top six but we didnt we didnt turn into clean sheets i think we kept one didnt we i dont know i think one or two clean sheets is all we got i think this season though is different because the whole season i think we only kept a couple of clean sheets all season it was pretty bad i think that this season though we will weve weve solved the setpiece issue with melan kovic there and i just think were growing as a team and were going to get more clean sheets and suddenly as a im probably opposite to you i dont try and talk up forest too much because i know that what are you implying what are you implying i know that as fbo assets theyre not i wouldnt advise going there right gibbs white maybe at the start of season i was pushing him but i wasnt wasnt talking about our defense even though the data was good last season but having watched that i do think that moreno at 44 oreno at 44 both of them at 44 good prospects good because i think we are going to go we havent we didnt concede at southampton we havent conceded at liverpool weve won four straightway games now and weve kept clean sheets in the last two were gonna c start keeping clean sheets at home and weve got fulham palace leicester west ham newcastle in a run there that i would say theres two or three clean sheets there potentially because i think our defense is strong enough to keep to keep fulham palace leicester and even west ham i think well get a couple of clean sheets out of that four so if youre looking for 4 five44 oena moreno probably would be my choice because he offers so much going forward and so it is probably time for me to take the nonforest blinkers off and go have a look at them as soon as you start to show a bit of faith its all its all g to go i know thats the thing well get fresh at brighton because its its still robinsons just had a price rise but he goes into newcastle forest man city villa in the next four which isnt great then everton away everton are awful defensively but are managing to score goals and then its brenford who are also managing to score whereas like you say forest around that time brighton fulham palace leicester west ham seems if i was buying a defender now it definitely wouldnt be robinson id be look id be looking an or ive just got a soft spot for moreno hes hes hes got the quality going forward as well i would say he is as good as robinson going forward he is an attacking fullback and hes probably got better delivery than robinson robinsons got that relationship down that side now and hes been in fulham for a couple of seasons and whereas moreno hasnt so hes more settled but i think moreno will flourish at forest and i think its good i think its good to talk about hes got to be someone we look at any more love for sals i think weer like the back four looks solid but the keeper is still a worry we will buy a keeper in january ive absolutely no doubt but until then you can go sales because hes going to play every week i think because i dont think i dont think theu girls ready but we are undoubtedly buy a keeper in january because i think its now the weak spot in the team so well address it and i think well go back in for kellerer i think well try again so okay but and elsewhere on his table villa showing up well arsenal in fifth its perhaps what we expect is there a defense there you expect to be higher maybe united you expect to be pushing a little bit higher newcastle havent picked up from where they were last season despite having an easy run in terms of fixtures their defense still doesnt look worth investment and what can you say about everton at the moment its theres not too many surprises i would expect brenford to be higher ahead of their good run youd expect them to climb that table right vaner bs come in four million option for us theres a slight concern about whether if he if he doesnt play three at the back whether he keeps his place but youve always been pretty hot on him havent you like 25m pounds they paid hes a good player i think hes hes hes pretty much id definitely be taking the punt on him if i could if they back four hes not guaranteed a start because collins and pinnick at the moment of the first choice i would say newcastle im surprised that being a bit i know they paid that southampton game but teams look easy to get at them there doesnt seem to be a lot of solidity there wolves carve them open time and time again they were lucky to escape that game two individual moments of absolute brilliance another share rocket although a little bit of a deflection but the bars winner was worthy of winning any game but w wolves had some good chances in that match and theyre doing well look at the if you look at the rating like we know how tough the start theyve had but theyre 11th on the on the table so credit to them i like wolves i like stran larson i thought he played well in that game theres a lot of play like a nori a lot of players who weve talked about who we might consider but its just not the best time for them nothing massively surprising the only one to talk about here is villa because k is popular but clean sheets just dont seem to be coming but the defensive underlying thats a good weve seen this before with teams like palace in previous years when defensive datas always been at the highest but just hasnt translated i dont know about coner im still not im not convinced hes a good option out of robinson and cono who would you keep thats a good question because robinsons got the attacking threat but cons got the fixtures you would keep coner out of the two if i had to pick one of the two it probably would be coner but i dont think i id pick him so id rather go for moreno or rer or who what we come on to defenders in a bit davis i think leave davis now swit his fixtures looking better i think id take a punt on him because just for a bit of excitement or sagawa youre just trying to make me say sara arent you sara good we talked about him last week but i prefer leaf davis like for me set plays and i think its only hes got one assist but we havent seen the best of him yet it which needs home games if you look at the ticker i think theyve got some fixtures coming up where youd expect them to start showing up as an attacking force their bottom of the attacking data were probably about to see that so they havent been able to flex in that way but i think thats coming i like the look of dap and i think theyve got players theyve bought well and i think of the promoted teams they for me are the one that i think could break out and give us some joy in terms of fbl assets dap was like horrible because i went to the i went to the brighton game missed the first 20 minutes because of a lot of stress but d when dap came off the whole crowd breed the side relief because he didnt offer too much but that run he went on when he just completely outpaced van heck and i thought i thought van heex either going to bring him down for a penalty or hes going to score and just off the top of the bar it was so a great option davis was shackled though he barely came forward at all in that game and it was it switch just put all the men behind the ball and just look to hit on the on the counter which is i think gavves is a hell of a player as well should have got him every ball we put in hes there just heading it away hes he was he was brilliant attack we got city at the top attack got harland putting chance is away liverpool still second despite the blank at forest man utd in third i saw was it jan batra tweeted about rashford trying to get people in invested in him what do you think i was gonna mention him later no you dont youre not i was like i was like no we cant be going near rashford a goal against the mighty barley in the cup good performance before two didnt he i we talked i moaned about what we need we need a bit of a bit of a pep and i think if rashford was to come good thats thats the thing we need right like a i dont know i everyone would flood to him i think hes so streaky though isnt he thats the trouble its like its its time in it with rashford couple of seasons ago i got him on at the right time and i ced him a few times and it turned out well for me but then i think weve seen him just collapse again and itll be good to see him back to some for and being in our thoughts again i would welcome it i think i dont know the other option is gacho but hes not starting is he because dios no keeping him but hes hes brilliant every time he comes off the bench some he scored in the last premier league game ob he scored yesterday as well i dont know how long doo can keep him out for he will be an option at 65 at some point in the season im sure he will i know youre not united fans feel is a bit of a mystery as to why hes not starting yet and until he does we cant go there but there could be options coming from united which would be nice because theyve been a bit of a its been a a derf is we havent been a to go there at all for a while defensively theyve been shaking i still wouldnt trust them defensively but if they if those two come out then itd be that would be very useful indeed viller in fourth brighton in fifth we did show a bit of a different side to us i thought in that if switch game and not in a good way which is how much we struggle to break down that low block defending deep team and weve seen that before thats been classic brighton lots of half chances dominating the game not being able to kill it off i think other than matas shot which he should have scored with we didnt create that much and i think ifwi were fairly comfortable against us because we couldnt do what we normally do which is create loads of space out wide get all wingers like cutting in hitting on the counter because there was nothing to counter because they werent they didnt have the ball so our high press high counter method didnt work so i wanted to maybe see we had like a plan b for that and against everton we maybe did we maybe looked better as the game went on but we didnt against we could have played that game for another two hours and not scored against ipswitch youre getting me very excited for sunday because id like to think were better defensively and better offensively than it witch so thats going to be interesting but will you go for it no i think well probably play a very similar game to we did at liverpool i would have thought i think well start hudson adoy but i dont think well start both of them i think we are going to beat you i think we are so i know well well talk about predictions in a bit my dad is four out of four for brighton so far hes predicted the draws against ipsw and arsenal which is outrageous and the wins against everton and man utd so he thinks were gonna win so its its very different to you the big thing is if we got pedro back r was ineffective was he that game thats good news for pedro owners it is good news im im gonna say it and i probably get slamm for it but im sure pedro comes back into the 11 if you got him no i think youre right thats nice were fifth on the table look at the bottom three though southampton lester it switch just what i was about to come to and everton as well everton southampton lester and i switch theyve got to be the four favorites to be fighting it out for promotion out relegate relegation not promotion theyre and ipswitch are the ones who i think have got the best chance of staying up i think at this point out of the four jamie vards scoring goals but hes barely having any shots and you got to think that conversion isnt goingon to isnt going to carry on but it switch right down x n p 90 of 039 that is leicester a 19th with 083 they that is incredibly low it is but i think the fixtures are king here thats why i think they will start to come out there sh i think when mckenna looked at the pictures he thought were not going to be able to show ourselves until what five or six games in so i think that theyve given a good account themselves already and i think theres enough there to make me think theres po so well see i hope so because i want be great if lee davis is goes one further than doubt he did last year for loon goes to double figures for assists that be great other thing to mention here we talked about the arsenal attack and it hasnt been on point yet which is perhaps where rya has been in the bonus where it shows there is their 12 right 125 xg on penalty per 0 im very surprised at that they again against arsenal i dont know whats wrong with i cant even speak properly against brighton they dominated the play sacka got a lot of joy down the side they had a couple of chances but nothing massively clearcut i wouldnt i wouldnt have thought even hs goal was a brilliantly well taken lob against spurs they struggled in the first 20 30 minutes to even get out i spurs played well massively on the front foot too so im im surprised in the sense that theyve got so much like great attacking like talent in the team and you think with games against wolves and against brighton they would they would maybe have created a little bit more than they have done sack are interest to know what to do with we talked about him at the start already but if odard is out and this is going to be a bit of a pattern then i think hes hes sellable isnt he well the other thing is it impacts havit as well like havit was going to be perhaps a real hope for us as an eight million forward but if hes going to play the midfield role which looks like he is were not going to gamble on tra are we as a field asset maybe we will but thats how its looking jesus is a threat to tr arlo so i look at it and think the oard injury it redu his sacks appeal it moves havocs back which jedu is his appeal trs not an option because jeesus is a threat to him suddenly its like well if you want arsenal you just go ry and a defender dont you and its like thats thats what i meant when i started the show with a bit of dear it feels like things are contracting before our very high is and the od injury is just another twist that does it the thing for watkins is another twist that we didnt expect that like who expected us to think watkins is an next mins problem no chance of that we thought it was a 90 minute player didnt we but i dont see that stopping either so its annoying its just annoying like hopefully sacka comes through it and saaka takes the mantle and goes even without od god im going to be the key man and my outputs not going to be affected but well see well see the jew is out isnt it ive just had a message from focal about the obs video resolution so ive just changed a couple of settings on obs i cant honestly everything looks fine on my screen so were using obs and were not using obs are but we are technically because were streaming it to thingy anyway ive tried ive tried a few things let me know if that stunt made any difference whatsoever maybe it has maybe hasnt but let me let me know should get some play data we can lets have a look at goalkeepers to start with i think we did a quite a big segment on this i dont think anythings massively changed too much apart from the fact that sales might be an option for us going forward but i still think youre going to go ryer or youre gonna go flecken at this point aren you i think thats the way isnt it what i interesting what wild cards do i think because of the oard injury were going to see wild cards with ry and gabrielle now which at the start of the season people have gone v has too much to pay for a keeper but its a bit like harland is it nowhere near as profitable but 29 points for a keeper is still good and im ive been on the end of ive had seasons where ive own that keeper like flecking on 12 points and started looking up and thinking i thought not having a good keeper is not a big deal but theres already 17 points between fle and martin and ryer and henderson theres 21 points different so is that 21 points worth a million it probably is it probably is isnt it so and were not talking about rea whos playing for a team who isnt about theyre the best defensive team as well so i do think were starting to come around to the idea now id be surprised if rey wasnt very popular in wild cards anyway look at henderson down in 23rd eight points ry matched him in an away game against spurs his entire season points its absolutely its amazing how that adds up how the keeper because you your perception is its the position that has the least impact on your team i think it still probably is but when there is one or two keepers racing away with it and weve seen it in previous seasons you look up and think god the gap is quite big its much bigger than i expected fen i think is a very good bet because hell make saves and they got great fixtures so four fs are still going to be an option because of fens fixtures but i do think the odard thing might make people think well i dont need two arsenal attackers so im going to go an arsenal defender and ill go ryer i think that might be what we see i think rays reay is the pick i think ray is the pick out of the arsenal defense i think rs the pick out of the goalkeepers his price hasnt gone up yet which he must be on the verge of going up to 56 hell be a six million goalkeeper by the end of the season ive got no doubt and how many points can he get hes hes on track to score the most of any goalkeeper ever surely because how many clean sheets are they going to get this season 38 games they could get 15 men i say 15 20 15 20 clean sheets the thing is hes showing to be a good keeper isnt he as well because like in pre i think last season it was like well hes a hes a top 10 keeper in a top one defense but when tested rys gonna concede goals but this season hes shown up to be pretty outstanding when they have let chances through and they have hes hes made some good saves so he deserves to be there on merit its not because hes the defender has done all the work for him he has put in shifts and made some good saves so youre getting a very good keeper in front of or behind a very good defense so but i do think four fes could still come out sales weve talked about fleen as well so its not a done deal not yet for br hes very impressive i thought he was he was very impressive against hip switch as well and when he was called into action he just looks very astute very confident i do still worry i did the forest pod today with with matt which was which was good he lets me talk about brighton when i go on there unlike you who shut me down okay very nice he asks me my opinions on brighton lets me go on monologue i must have a word him hes got it all wrong its been lovely i cant remember the point i was trying to make but it was h you worried about wor about the ball over the top thats it i dont think weve got like well exactly well you havent got any pace or we havent well not like if alanga comes on then you got to worry but i dont think hell start so hudson or against velman would be interesting he reminded me of last season we come off the back of that roma thrashing and then we played you and you put out a weird like was terrible team and we ended up winning that game and i just think surely you play hudson or danga against veltman and whos even gonna be at left back its probably gonna be kadogo id say because i dont think hoods gonna play there again kadogo got some minutes in the last game its going to be thatll be a tough matchup for him i think langer is class but you dont think hell start no i think hell play w prow and anderson and well try and win a few free kicks around the box and let war prows do his thing so well see i just want war prows is a player that when ive ever watched him for southampton and west ham ive thought to myself i wish we had a player who every time the free kick is won youre youre genuinely excited because youre expecting it to be on target if not going in and now hes in our team i just cant wait for the first fre kick we win because that anticip score this and the opposition fans are like christ its good i i enjoy having him in the team so i think for that reason hell play well see anyway lets move on to defenders so we cant talk about youre youre going right youre going on sunday ill be doing my walkout videos from brighton on sunday morning and taking some footage from the game as well so make sure you get there in plenty of time unlike yellow and i who just completely messed up our timing what happened we just we left a bit late a bit too late and it was one of those ones where we would have got away with it if there wasnt all the traffic in the world and then we got to we got to m park where you because you have to get a park and ride bus over to the stadium from the from mil road that was completely full so we had to park at the wi dean which was our old stadium and get a taxi over to the stadium we got stuck in traffic we a football match who would have fought it i absolutely outage the game had bloody started it was 10 minutes in and there was there was its however long you think its going to take you to get to the amx add another hour onto it it was funny because we walking around the like right the outside of the wood bean and i said to this is this is our old stadium she was like this was a stadium just about this is defender data on the on the screen look at that milinkovic right at the top 066 is that just because of like one good chance that one for match of day challenge where i went remember so but he second hes a threat to set plays and with james wprs taking him we could see something from him so but i still prefer the fullbacks if youre looking at forest players go ahead trent and then romero and delit as well showed up didnt he for the goals at sav anton he did lets talk about trent quickly what at what point does trent become an issue for us because were talking about him like hes completely indispensable and we wouldnt go anywhere near him thats thats fine but its still no attacki returns for him he is still seven millionish and there are going to be wild cards being played are we entering into a period where there might be a case to go without him i wouldnt personally not yet i can see what youre saying i dont know against forest he didnt c he had four chances but none of those were good were good chances but it was a difficult game for him the best is to come i still think that hes going to be youre not going to be hitting registering an average of 064 and not getting returns so we will start seeing assist soon and hell get two three four goals maybe over the season as well i still think that teams wild card teams will be buil built with him in i dont think theres strong alternatives yet city defenders vardal is there of course lewis is there but lewis doesnt cost you money and hes still an option hes starting tonight which i didnt expect so why you can go lewis to cover the city defense why would you not have the money to go trent to cover to cover liverpool unless of course youre going to go gabrielle and porro and rya so maybe like that combination means you need to bring your budget down for trent so maybe the emergence of the arsenal defense is the way to go rather than going to arsenal attackers you go to arsenal defenders that might mean people have to move money out of their defense but i wouldnt do it id stick with its four game week small sample and the data suggests that returns are coming all sack is hang on he as a season keeper last week absolutely its just one of those on like rogers isnt it like you watch rogers play you think hes close to points and it the weeks go on and on hes not delivering rogers is a five million asset you can bench but trent needs to start getting something but these stats are so encouraging arent they like 064 ex on p 90 hes creating three chances a game the second best is poro with 25 is also a good option but its its even higher than that hes hes not going anywhere hes not going anywhere from my team im keeping him and i dont think wild cards will overlook him yet youre right patience might run out but i think thats folly and i also think defensively liverpool are better this season too so youre gonna get more clean sheets anyway which makes it easier if he was eight million by now we probably see people losing patience but i think at 7even million with the with the options around him i think thats fine i think you hold him and i think he will come good and then some so youd rather have him than diaz j would you i think if youre going to pick one other than seller are the xmin theyre only getting an hour and thats a real shame isnt it i want diaz to be a thing but with gatos showing up so well last night youve got to think that its going to continue that were going to see diaz every time you get to an hour mark between 60 and 70 minutes if you own diaz or josy youre expecting it arent youre expecting the ball to go up and youre almost thinking dont kick it out try and play try play for another 10 minutes without kicking it out because its a horrible feeling ive owned those assets before and eventually you start going n lets go to an e or a gon who are gonna give me 90 minutes lewis lets talk about lewis i think i said to you last week is there a chance lewis could go to left back and we were both we were both like he could do but why would he because gavardo was there that is what happened i dont know if thats good for him or not because hes surely not going to carry on its good in the way that he can hes versatile he can play in different positions so hes got more roots into the team but youd rather he would nail down a spot on the right potentially doesnt case that hes on the right tonight hes on the right tonight and im shocked because i thought walker was back in the weekend to get him ready for tonight and then walker doesnt show up tonight i dont know if theres an injury i havent seen that but i think its clear that lewis is getting the level of minutes that lewis is getting he was off at halim on saturday that must have been with this in mind i dont know its just strange we cant yet figure it out and i think now that european fixures are here well get more answers i was chatting to luke about it and its like its almost like weve got to throw out what we know so far about peps lineups and start again and reassess and tonights lineup is interesting its not what i expected i did expect walker to be in there and lewis maybe to make way do we think lewis starts against arsenal i personally not expecting him to and ive got him benched but if i knew he was going to start i might even start him because he does offer you something going forward as well hes just the darling at the moment and at the moment i just see him st in most games would you buy him now yes i think i think you would if you wild card i think you give it another week i think you want to see what happens against arsenal if youre wild card in six its pretty perfect and most people are going to be wild card in gw six or seven now would have for unless people are going to push it right out i think you wait and see what happens against arsenal if he starts against arsenal i said doneal isnt it youve got to you got to go there i think so because eventually i think its a bit like trent the attacking data here 41 xra on penalty hes got one assist so far hes going to add to that with that in that team hes going to get more assists and perhaps one or two goals as well so you cant avoid him i dont i dont think you can ignore him yep i wanted to talk about robertson he was a bit of a darling this week i know quite a few people did gabrielle to j robber i think ben kellin did didnt he got hurt isnt it ouch it was it was it was quite a popular move do you think theyll people be regretting that now he shows up well on this hes 10th on the list 32 xg weve talked about liverpool looking decent defensively he got the rest in the champions league yesterday sim played in that so you got to think hes pretty nailed on to start i still think hes a hes a pretty good asset but i still think at six million id rather have gabrielle id rather have sber id rather have porro id rather have tren hes still quite far down the list for me i dont know if i gabrielle yes id rather have gabrielle i think there is for me if we know gabrielle and cela both start every game who would you rather have i think theres quite a gap between gabriel and civa i think we talked about it earlier in the preseason about whos going to be the threat at set plays and what we saw at spurs was he was a monster wasnt he like romero just didnt know what to do and there is a difference isnt there when the set pieces come in theres a difference in the level of threat between cra and gabrielle and i think that in the end could tell and could mean that gabrielle gets more points but is there still a naging doubt that cba is more nailed there is right so but gabriel has started its bit of a contrast to last season when he was dropped and had to fight his way back into the team he started so impressively no one scored more from set pieces than gabrielle since he signed no player and no defender scored more set pieces than gabrielle since he signed as well so he could go on and whos whos got the record for most goals for defenders probably i cant even i cant even think of it might maybe john terry got didnt he ianov he scored quite a few ivovic a few he could have a season where he gets seven eight goals thats what im thinking i think that could happen because the set pieces from arsenal look even better d than they did last season and they were scoring for fun they just caused so many issues and when youre up against a keeper like vicario who hes not going to come out and claim it very well it just its just an easy way to target points and to win the game with that is just it was funny though i was watching liverpool and milan last night and liverpool got the first goal canate from a set play and you watch the goal back and you thought my god just look at like theyve got nothing to stop liverpool at set plays like canato and van djk they look like they just want it far more than any of the milan defense and then 20 minutes later vanite scores as well same thing and it was like that arsenal spurs you saw set plays and you just think spurs just arent competing for the ball at set plays theyre just if the delivery is right its over they score and they and it happened and youve got to be strong at set plays to keep arsenal out because often the delivery is good and in gabrielle theyve got someone who just attacks the ball ferociously and its hard to stop it is so yes id rather have gabrielle over robertson because i think its going to be arsenal will keep more clean sheets and theyll keep clean sheets in difficult games and gabrielles always there its hard to predict when the goals come but they will come i think hell get five i think hell get five for sure so do i i think was it meron who said the other day he was like sometimes people just chuck up their center backs and they tr up and it theyre doing it because theyre told to whereas the arsenal center backs go up thinking theyre going to score every time they go up id be id be surprised if gabrielle didnt get five goals this season maybe they get shared a bit more between him and ca maybe the other thing is if odard is out is artetta thinking were gonna have to make more set place now because scoring goals from open play might be more difficult for us so they might even over index on them they might even put more effort in but their set play coach is first class and they and theyre scoring the patterns they run the routines they are you look at him you think god how you stop that the movement and aggression is just different level so and a massive shout out to james of planet fbl because i was listening to his ask james podcast and the questions kept coming in should i bench gabrielle do this every time james was like dont bench gabrielle do not bch gabrielle against us thing coming he was like they he was like both cra and gabriel were both have a good chance against us from a set piece i cant remember sleep having one but gabri needed one to score so we absolutely called that the question is if you had to pick one out of gabrielle and rea where would you go id want them both now i think but no thats not thats not an option id probably go reay just because you can get poro and you can get trent and you can get lewis so you dont have to have gabrielle but i think hes by far the best alternative to three now moving porro up to gabrielle probably people going to look at that i imagine look at this and robo eight ball got gabrielle off the bench for pedro disgraceful that is that is absolutely i was happy with smith row but that is next level any other defenders fair play any other defenders mention ben white hasnt shown up yet hes further down there weve talked about aa moreno isnt on this table yet but a few home games expect him to show up because he will start creating eight nor was going to be an option but wolves have gone back to a back four havent they so that takes the shine off him a little bit i think more than a little bit maybe and ive read that walls 16 games without a clean sheet now so defensively they are there to be got at so maybe we talked about him last week but maybe we need to call our boots on him a bit dena did we talk about him im only joking but he got he got the assist didnt he we slay him last week he slay he turned with an assist played again as well last night in the champions league hes matson isnt getting anywhere near the team at the moment no its just not what we expected at all was it and hes playing well the only other one i pick out is leaf davis here hes 29th on this table 16 watch him climb that lets see if he can make the top 10 in a few weeks because i think i wouldnt be surprised if hes climbing that table soon y i think focal might be on something with these graphics by the way because apparently they are a lot better okay any complaints while what i did if you care is i put up the bit rate on obs well thanks to focal for that midfielders we got gacho at the top we spoke about him a little while a little while ago 234 x non p 90 he hasnt has he started yet he started one d started all not started one game that is madness goalen assist for him we cant consider him barnes is the same isnt he you thought barnes might keep gordon out the side but turns out the other side tell you what hes got to start i when he came on i immediately stuck him in my so rare team and he got me the goal because i knew that hes going to make an impact i think hes been playing well when hes been on the pitch for newcastle did well in preseason as well i just dont see how can leave him out now because he carries so much direct threat and him and gordon i didnt think c played well again i watched the game and i was like as an eak owner first half i was like he might as well go off because i just couldnt see him doing anything know they were gon was good gordon looked lively but that was about it i just dont know whats missing from them this season the verve has gone the verve and the vigor and the i dont know have you watched them and ive just been totally unconvinced every time i think the biggest problem is losing trippier losing the amount of chances he created you think about the start of last season how effective was they were looking to get the ball to him at every opportunity they could so he could create something from the riot and now hes not in the team theyve moved gordon over to the to the other side theres just not a lot of creativity in the side so no youre right thats it so theyre asking for players to step up with individuals so its b like watching england play theres not a whole amount of cohesion be between the team so theyre looking for the big players to step up and create something out of nothing and that is what happened in the ws game but i wasnt impressed with them and theyve had good results its been a good start of the season results wise but in every match ive been pretty disappointed with them and im holding gordon wheres gordon on this list is he on the top hes not even the top 20 to 30 30 68 isnt too bad its pretty good no he has he has played well and its just its just i just something isnt right at newcastle and it makes me wonder as an eak owner how long i can hold him until weve got to we need it to click and hes another example of what we isak is a player that if you havent gone harland or you havent gone harland and salah you can hold isak and hope where he might be able to trade blows with them too but no not sign of it because nas arent playing well enough no i agree with that jotters six on the list weve been talking about him talking about him being being a bit poor the last few games but the stats are impressive diaz is third 139 ex on p for 90 jot is there with 125 and salahs in fourth at 131 sandwiched in the middle between them but even with these stats im just not convinced on jo i think i think he probably has to go for me right do you think he start bouth i think theres a risk there because of gat poos performance last night because you got to think diaz comes back in and gat post stak in a claim i think he loves joto i think and we know that slot doesnt doesnt alternate his team although he has he did say last night well we havent played midweek yet and so j starting last night would suggest that perhaps he does alternate it and lets face it hes not going to look at the forest performance and think that it worked but he was pleased last night with what he saw but then gpo played a big part in that so youve got to think gst do a start isnt he so theres a risk there for sure y i think i probably will get rid smith row 55m you sold him this hes up to 57 now isnt hes hes had a couple of price rises gold and assist for him still coming off around the 70 minute mark but ex 9 83 im happy with him easy hold easy hold i do regret selling him the only reason i sold him was because i had the money to go directly smith ro toza which meant i could keep son and on the off chance he got something at ar or maybe this week against brenford that was probably worth doing but i regret it because had i gone son to sonto id have had money to take whis out now for probably maybe even watkins i dont know id have to do the calculation but i think so it would have given me more options than my transfer this week had i done that and of course me throw out scored some but its its tough got that wrong but its it could have gone the other way as well i did expect arsenal to maybe give up more ground declan rice there but spurs never looked like scoring for me they just didnt create enough and s was ab i thought i thought he had a poor game so smith row with heavy heart and maybe if im wild carding soon hes someone i will maybe get back no classic reversal how you feeling about e now because the underlying stats are good 093 he 18 you want more you hes hes shown they seos had 20 shots and as had 18 so theyre theyre the top two for shot volume from midfield but its just not had the output just the one goal and the pens thing now you we thought that was part of the contract when we signed him and its its not now because matas maybe taking them all but so it is dependent on that i do think returns will come man united and everton next to youve got to keep him for those two because i think he will threaten united because pis will raise himself for that game and everton well theyre conceding three goals in every game so youve got to think hes in line for something there and out of the cup last night as well to southampton its bad for sean isnt it bad dear but we are g to talk about k l in a minute maybe hes the one to turn him around rogers if youre wondering is 63rd on this list is 90 isnt great 037 hes more of an eye test player isnt hes the classic hes the classic grass versus spr sheet i think he is he is grass fcs mascot now because i watch him every week and i think how the hell has he not got anything from this but he is getting a 90 is five million the villa fixures are still great its just like this week for example i probably got a bench one of smith row or rogers and that is such a difficult choice because i think the the fixtures with rogers but smith row keeps finding a way to get in bench maybe i should tell you the bench rogers because the inevitable will happen if you do surely theres a double figure return coming for rogers thats what im thinking thats what im thinking and smith r is gonna keep ticking along but im still trying to hit that double digit for rogers well i havent got that dilemma im gonna im gonna start him but i would start rogers myself but hes currently hes currently starting so well see and the only play i want to talk about was bowen he might be a factor for us in a few weeks maybe hes hes hes a bit pricey but two assists and a goal ex9 not great 041 hes 54th on the list of all midfielders i cant believe antonio is still starting for west ham surely theyve got to change that up and get full krug in or get another option i think he i think he is i think he is but theyve got they got to get him in as soon as hes fit right because antonio shouldnt be playing premier league level anymore should hes still a bit of a handful but i agree with you and i just wonder how is bing not going to play down the middle eventually well thats what im ly doesnt want to go there does he it seems so i dont know i dont know west ham come whats their fixures like i dont think they pick up that well theyre patchy still arent they its a big step to go to bing i think when inos about and okay they are theyre not bad but the next two its wheres the run wheres the concentrated run where youre expecting returns united forest everton but he can get go its now isnt its its if youre going to invest in bowen its probably now because you get chelsea at home brenford ipswitch spurs man united thats not a bad one but would you go for him over embo whos got spurs west ham wolves man united switch probably not if youre if youre only going for harland you maybe got a bit more money to play around but i do like bowen but like you say i think theres theres probably better options and the fixures arent good enough to go there i also think under ly are they a side that are going to let rip and score three or four goals they i remember them going to bright them scoring three and beating you on your own territory and under moyers every now and then they just had that performance that made you think what kudos and b in they could be options but under ly at the moment i dont i havent seen them take the hand break off and that makes me think i dont want to go there at the moment id love him to be an option though this is what we need we need those players to come through him so lets hope it happens y lets go for some forward in for crog is fit okay niger well i cant figure out then answers on post as to why antonio starting hes flagged hes flagged on f s hes got a yellow flag p n says pet was bench i think thats because of brazil right because he was he came back from that i expect petta to be straight back in but if f is fit then surely has to he has to go into the side forwards i dont think we need to talk about harland anymore i dont want to talk about pretty decent is they the only to mention here is and maybe this is a crme of comfort 73 accuracy and 45 conversion rate he cant keep that up thats not possible youre gonna be saying that every week to g we i know and i think i said it last week didnt i said that of all the players this is the one player where you think maybe it can be sustainable because hes he is a machine hence the title of this show this week but i dont want to spend any more time on watkins we talked about wia thats a cool blow got i was never going to play scor and then went off injured he was not going to get in my 11 until gw six but i bought him with that i bought him for the immediate game which he got me a return in then i thought i ben sh for a couple bring it back in six i him for the lovely run probably double up onmo heres a question for you with whist out any impact on inmo i think so because theyve got such a good partnership havent they thats thats evolved over the last over the last couple of seasons tony had the ban at the start of last season they were forced into that partnership tony came back was ineffective brenford struggled tonys out again and then bu v both started well again and hes a good player v loads of energy he can finish causes defenses absolutely tons of problems as well also it lets aumo d drift out right which hes effective at doing and coming in from the from the right i wonder ifs going have to stay a bit more central now i what happens d and sharda comes in well thats what thats where the smart money is going isnt it and i think that maybe carvalo could play a could be a factor in this i wonder whether car after last nights performance somehow found a place in that team because hes a quality player isnt he so i dont know whether some system can be built around carvalo as an option by thomas frank i just dont know but at the moment itll be shardow will start down the middle with and bumo playing off him and maybe cal comes in into a midfield role but well get one this is if youre wild card in wild card six i dont know if youll have enough information to make a decision on brenford in terms of is vandenbberg an option is sharder an option is cavalia an option maybe we need a bit more data before we can commit but you can move to them when it sorts itself out theres no doubt though the brenford run is so strong that you want get on it though right is sher an option at 54 in midfield i think so i think that if youre brave and you commit the wild card this week or next then its worth going for i think because so the fixes is just so good hes not a prolific goal scorer hes not a central striker in my opinion two goals is the most the most hes ever had in the league it could be worth going for because i think that itd be nice i think you can take a risk on a couple of gambles and how big a gamble would it be because i think he will start and i think hell start down the middle for a team with good fixture so i like it i like the idea of it youre getting a 54 out position midfielder with lets say lets say you wild c in six with west ham and wolves at home theyre man utd and ipswitch if youre going to take a punt on someone and then move off a highly owned player like smith row even rogers someone like that then he might be someone to consider kevin sharder look at i was talking about him xery i was impressed with hes fourth on the on the list he how he didnt come away with a return against southampton i dont know he looked lively and interesting but again im not sure were going to be risky how much is he in fbl is he about six million six and a half he was he started his season at seven million i he didnt turn up with the reputation as a prolific goal scorer hes more he plays he play a role in the buildup hes hes somewhat creative as well and i think that hland is the goal scorer and zeri is just a different option and i think we can see that right i dont i dont think hes going to attt investment when theres midfield options from united thats the problem i it was one of those games all right i saw the highlights of it and its just every highlight seemed to feature zury in some way it was we dont fully trust him yet but hes someone who might emerge for us a bit later in the season hes someone ive now put on my radar when i hadnt thought about it but maybe it was just the like southampton effect and we need to be a bit be a bit less warm on it anyone else you want to talk about here was well every time we got to talk about weve got to talk about calv lein dr david 1963 hes very popular 59m im seeing loads of transfers in for him just to come back to the fixtures again the fixtures for everton are unbelievable b leicester crystal palace newcastle both at home ip switch fulham southampton west ham brenford man united wolves thats right up to gw 15 dont play any top six teams until game we 15 its crazy isnt it and they will have to score goals and to be honest like in attacking terms they have had spells long spells in games where theyve looked convincing him and mcneil there is no reason why you shouldnt consider them with that run of fixtures mcneil i dont think we touched on in midfielders hes 54 i believe and so could be an alternative in that no players created more chances in the league 17 chances so those two we should talk about them my only fear is the levels of confidence in the everton camp and how long is it before it starts to tell on the output of the attackers as well c l on pens as well though so it sound were scratching round at the moment are we with the visa injury that does seem to be the most obvious replacement chris wood could be as well though because i do think forest to grow in as a force and weve got decent fixtures and he could score you were you were last week why not in that bracket and the other player to mention is inia because i do think hes 59 maybe if you dont have eza its an option i dont know if i double up on ezza and cer but united and everton i think its only he got his first goal for the club last night its only a matter of time before he scores in the league so hes another option so there are there are choices there to move visa out to evan nilson as well maybe in that bracket too yep none of them none of them are gotos none of them are obvious and maybe calv l is the most obvious because of what we know in the past and the fixtures so im im behind it but i think if i was wild carding id probably look to probably go with watkins and harland and a four five probably if is what i do i dont know if id go fre strikers i think i still think j pedro is the one if hes if hes fit 5 five i still think thats incredible value theres a moon is problem for a lot of people who started with him after his what 40 shots and no goal of all the players weve talked about today you can have patience with players and seb still got in kungu so you never know what might happen but moes is the obvious sale for me if youve got him because him has came in and scored and you have got options now to move you could move down to caval you could move to vardy for example you could move to pedro if you havent got him evan nson like you mentioned there were options around that bracket so if youve got moones i think thats quite a quite an easy sell if i had mes id be taking a pun on cavalon although hes is ill at the moment thats it the thing is with c as well its the fitness isnt it is he just finds a way of breaking down and so you can look at that fix run and think well hes going to be great for that fix run but you cannot take anything for gron with his fitness because weve seen it year after year havent we daps going to be an option for us at some point this season i like him i like him and when i switch gets some slightly better fixtures i think hes gonna start scoring some goals i reckon hell get im gonna im gonna go optimistic im say he gets 12 goals this season what for c lein no deap dap maybe but between 10 and 12 goals maybe get double f its very difficult for a promoted striker to get double figures but you rate him do you i like him i like him i thought was built was buil as the as the goal scorer maybe but dap may be more as a battering r but maybe hes looking very direct hes got a lot of threat pace and strength so its whereever its which can make the most of the better fixtures but i think between eight and 10 might be ambitious minutes are a bit of a concern as well because he was again he was subbed early against brighton just a lot just a lot to like about him right anything else on forwards we move on no i will say that the data has been wrong tonight so it has been spotted in chat and i spotted it as we go so the xgi column is not correct so i dont know whats gone wrong with that so apologies and i will post the proper calculations post podcast so sumits gone wrong in the calculations they look right no theyre not theres no way harlands got 228 xgi non penalty per 90 right so somethings gone wrong there so the order is right in terms of probably the xgi tally but not the totals in that column its not been right for any of the table so apologies for that oversight very difficult very difficult to get it right after work sometimes when you when youve got up against it so i will check them and put new tables out on twitter post release to get when i say they look right like they look logical like none of them look they look logical but the numbers arent right the calculations so somethings gone wrong in the xl calculation so ive been spotting it all night thinking that cant be right and its been spotted in chat as well so apologies for that but i dont think anythings misleading i think like the order of the players is probably ab thats what and the other data is its just the xg non penalty per 90 column i dont know whats gone wrong i need to look at it so apologies for that nigel hes fuming on mute no marks gone to beat up nigel poor nigel he doesnt he doesnt deserve that thats it for forwards while mark is gone i just want to talk about sleeper who the sponsor of black box this season interesting one this time out if anyone listening to this is looking at becoming a form of content creator for their club or has any interest in making social media posts making videos doing all that thing s got a paid opportunity to do that its called the 12 voice theres a link in the description into this video and essentially you can fill out an entry form you can send over to sleeper and theyre looking for people or fans who are of clubs to do social media posts to to do videos to do all different content around their own their own club i debated entering it for brighton and then thought im already doing enough cont know youre the same mark theres no way im doing because i do forest focus as well and planet fbl correspondent but its good and well see well see who comes forward hopefully some of the fpl community volunteer for that because itd be good to see some of the some of the names representing their clubs we know there knowledgeable people out there for their club so lets see who comes forward so and is like as i said i did the forest pod talking about brighton and talking m about the match up and if you if a bit about your about your club theres nothing better than just getting a platform to talk about them and talk about your views and things so give it have a look at the link fill out the application if youre interested and you might be the next content creator for your for your club lets take a look at some fixtures then this is our predictions for the week coming up they all pretty similar again mark were getting a bit i know i not too bit too similar with these i think you moved the you moved the garden center game from forest brighton up to west h i think youre probably right i know well i believe you made the garden center game forest i was take that went straight off when i saw that no chance i do think the the west ham chelsea game is probably the better option ill give you that well well start with them we start with west ham chelsea they are the garden center game im keep that logo on for the whole time were talking about it i might just move over a bit because its a bit not center it annoys me hang on but what would you make of this i this is one of the few ones weve gone different ive gone for a west ham win in this one i bournemouth i dont know how bournemouth lost that game to chelsea it was a real dingdong of a match 14 bookings 14 yellows i was like and it wasnt a filthy game it was like little niggly fouls but he just it just ran away with him full te bookings and it did take the edge off it was a horrible game to watch palmer i was watching throughout thinking come on come on convince me convince me i need pay attention of you and no just wasnt there and chelsea a work in progress managed to get through it a bit of quality bournemouth again were unlucky not to get more from the game and i thought they deserved at least a point from it so chelsea smash and grab a bit and kungu ironically off the bench and i dont know i dont know what to make of chelsea how long is it going to take before we start in them i think its going to be weeks yet isnt it the player i was most impress with sancho when he came on i thought that is that is what man utd have been crying out for ever since you signed and i havent seen any performances from him in the man utd shirt like the 45 minutes he put in for chelsea for his quick feet direct creating loads of chances defenders couldnt get near him half the time so been to see if he can if he can nail down a spot in the team but did you hear him after the match it was moresa talking about hes like ive said to enu and mada and sancho and just listing all these players and none of them are guaranteed like jesus christ 12 players youve listed mentioned ju hall who hasnt got a sniff either and its like its its got to be a bit of a mess isnt it mesas probably g got to put a front on but its its horrible and i just hope palmer can come through it and be what we need him to be because hes a and i love him hes a great player and i dont think hell hit the heights in next se last season but hopefully he can still emerge from the chaos that is there and be an option anyway thats our guarden center game ive gone for a west ham when youve gone for a one0 leicester everson big game theres two big relegation teams two relegation matchups this week ive gone for a leicester win 21 youve gone for a two if leicester do win this d could be packing his bags you think so already well could be i think theres a very real chance they could win it youve gone two1 ive gone two all i think that i can only think as a game of goals i dont trust i defense i think evan got enough in attack to cause leicester problems and you dont need much to cause everton problems it seems defensively why are they playing michael keane all the time when theyve got obrien i just dont know thats not helping ds calls because the everon fans can see it and kean was at fault for the watkins goal and i dont know and d knows keane from his bernie days so is there is there too much faith in him there i think you might be right theyre are theyre starting to ask questions arent they but u it depends on the nature of the defeat if they lose two or three nil then yes but squeaky win for leicester you still hope that d has got enough in the bank to keep his job true liverpool bournemouth liverpool looking to bounce back another trip to another trip another trip another game at anfield for them to bounce back against the bourn side who were going to play very differently to forest much less focused on defense i think its going to be again quite an open game for them which i think will suit liverpool ive gone for a couple of goals to bournemouth ive gone for three2 here youve gone for 31 whats behind that you just you just think theyre going to allow goals all of a sudden i think the i think the liverpool defense is strong i think bournemouth have got a lot going forward and in terms of pace and power they could maybe catch liverpool so i think they might get one and ive gone 31 i think they will bounce back i its hard to believe with the quality theyve got that they wont that theyll fall foul again and get a negative result which will be a negative result be a draw but i do worry like i came out came out the forest win delighted but also concerned that are they going to be our teams going to be able to repeat what forest did and thered be a lot of teams looking at that and thinking well theres a blueprint there that we can copy and there are possibly teams better equipped than forest to do it as well so i dont think bfar no i dont think bfar gonna do that no theyll press theyll press and theyll try and use their pressing to win the ball up the field i think that of all the i think ive seen data recently that shows that bournemouth the bre you had the most success pressing in advanced areas this season so theyll rely on that to try and get them chances and it might it might work but i think liverpool are good enough to play out of that and catch them so ive gone 31 yep youve also gone 31 in the southampton ips switch game we both gone for an ip switch win youve gone for three goals for ip switch ive gone for two and just the one for southampton again tricky one to call i just think ive been more impressed with it switch so far despite the fact theyve had quite tricky games theyre going to be better at keeping it at tight at the bat because se hampton are just too a side at times trying to play out from the back and if have got that threat up front but three 31 would be a real marker for rip switch i think in this in this one i just think theyve got it in them and i worry about southampton i just is what we thought the moment russell martin doesnt appear to be changing things up and he tried to go back four against united still got turned over by three goals and i just dont think theyre good enough theyve lost stevens now to a suspension so howard bellis will come back in i look at their defense and just ramsdale has made a difference and will make a difference and will keep that try and keep their goal conceded tally down but i just think hes got to thank this task i dont think defensively theyre strong enough and theyre exposed i do like flyn downs i think theyve got some good players around him but they havent got enough and ive seen what it takes firsthand to stay up and i look at southampton and just think i just dont see it i dont think theyre strong enough i know its a bit less important for us now what because in previous seasons when we known that were going to wild card in six say you dead end your team dont you make sure you use a transfer so you dont lose it whereas you dont lose it this time so you can bank and then and then wild card but if i was den ending the team this week i think leaf davis would be someone that id id look at because ive got robinson at home to newcastle i think newcastle score in that game looking at 45 asset i think you could go for one of suara or davis dont mind it going forward davis prob be the preference definitely i do think id make it switch the favorites for this game and both of us have gone for a way win and so if i was going anywhere that be be that be where i go i go leaf davis but there are there are home games to come thats where it switch and lea davis are going to be most effective just faned him because i just think theyve got more about them than sampton and i just worried defensively about sampton yep villa wolves the midlands derby ive gone for a 31 villa youve gone for a 2 nil so both expecting it to be relatively routine you never know whats gonna happen in these sorts of games though its just what impact is the european fixtures gonna have on villa they put a strong side out last night they won the game hows is that going to impact them but i think the quality theyve got and weve talked about the wolves defense they will win the game its whether or not wolves can catch them at the other end but we saw villas defensive data as being pretty strong so ive gone two nil i think it will be routine so watkins surely comes away with something from that then youd hope it depends if he can get it in the first hour l doesnt it get thats a trouble right so good point i think hes a decent captain option this week because youve got youve got obious got the liverpool bournemouth game with salah looking so good but there isnt a lot of other decent options i dont think from because harlands playing arsenal not going to go for either of those i wouldnt have thought although if he didnt have salah i probably would be tempted just to stick it on stick it on harland but who else is there maybe son at brenford if youve got him like you do might be an option maybe he comes out well in the in the alos is the 60 minute thing a problem maybe were putting too much into that 80 he got 80 against last night 60 okay fair enough so maybe but he got 80 because they were chasing the game though the thing the game state was suggest so i dont know does it put eye off the c i know that james on planet fbl captain him did well and he matched highland so maybe you just ignore that and hope that his ex mins goes up but duran you cant hes not gna leave jan on the bench is he thats the thing so its a problem but not cameras made the cameras a bit bigger for why not fullam newcastle youve gone for a newcastle win 21 ive gone for a one all i was quite surprised you went for a newcastle win as youve been quite down on their performances i just think barnes will start i think theyve got enough in attack and again i think the quality will win out but i im not hopeful of like an eak hall or anything here i just want to see them playing with a lot more rhythm and fluidity and that bit of verve and you are right perhaps it is just a c ity gz jo linton is there creativity youd think garez is creative enough but the trippier did bring so much youre absolutely right he was he was such an outlet for them in terms of their buildup play and his delivery was first class and the liento doesnt bring that so is that what theyre missing you might be on to something i think what you want to see if with liento and hall or whoever is okay they lose a bit of creativity but are they like a better defensive unit are they more solid i dont think they are either i think teams still feel like theyre able to get at them particularly when theyre playing away from home so ive gone for a drawing that spurs brenford ive gone for a 31 but spurs are struggling to score goals theyre struggling to convert the chances thats do pretty dominant displays against leicester where they couldnt score dominant display against arsenal in the first 30 minutes couldnt put the ball away slanky got 90 minutes but son looks a bit off it madison hasnt been performing ive gone for three but maybe a bit mb hope ful than logic i think they squeak it i wouldnt be surprised see bren forgets on it though and anie is just like going further and further into despair isnt he with every game he was very post match give it a rest please youve got to be i dont know i think you say a lot dont you people you tell a lot about someones character in adversity and the minute spurs started struggling his postmatch and his the way he treated his media just went downhill from what it was i loved his arrival at spurs and what he brought and some of the character he showed and some of the things he was saying then he lost all that the minute spurs started struggling and its carried on this season hes been so sour postmatch and dont know why you have to be like that i get it that hes its a very difficult job to do when you just lost a game to go in front of the press and the media but other managers manage it right i saw our manager steve cooper have to do it every week because we were losing many games and he never treated a media like that and i know perhaps hes not under the same pressure but there were degrees right and i dont like it and it makes me think well if hes like that for the cameras and the media which were all seeing what is he doing behind the scenes that we dont all see and its not good its not good and im starting to worry that hes job is isnt n secure because i would never have said this six months ago i thought he was doing a fantastic job and he was the player a manager to take spurs forward but theyre struggling arent they and some of the stats coming out now about his win rate and the recent run starting to be worrying so they i think theyll do enough here but an needs to get more from that team theres no doubt i saw i saw quite a good post about him which said when he first joined a lot of the media treated him almost like a bit of a ted lasso character like hes that plucky underdog hes come from australia hes inherited this team hes going to turn them around and all this and he hasnt he isnt playing up to that or doesnt want to play up to that or whatever because like you say the way he talks to journalist sometimes he did he does get asked some stupid questions and but the way he responds to them i dont think is a good way of is a good way of responding to them and like you say you talk about cooper i thought cooper was very classy the way he responded to the media and posu hasnt got the reputation to be able to get away with the way he talks at times no because pep does it doesnt he pep can be a little bit spiky with the press and when hes asked a silly question he makes it known its a cly question well i just dont i dont it makes you feel uncomfortable and if you support spurs do you want your manager to be like that do you do you laugh it off or do you start going being a bit of an isnt he it would start to worry you i think because you think well if hes like that there its getting to him he hasnt got the resolve to take defeat and take adversity and not let it show in how he comes across and as a leader and as a football manager thats a thats a weakness i would say so its a its worrying i think the way he talks in terms of its my second season i always win things in my second season look at the stats the way hes defensive about himself you dont tend to see too much you dont klopp had his moments where he was a bit of an but it wasnt in the same defensive way you marinho because he was very arrogant with things and when he got questioned but i havent seen that with many other managers so have to see how he how he turns around its not a great trait to have is it no its not i me weve seen it with a bit of slot as well a bit of arrogance he said about hes talking about losing to forest being a disgrace its like we are that was that was that wasnt great that wasnt a great look anyway palace man united ive gone for my im sure i get slated for this ive gone for a palace win here two1 man united one all youve gone for a draw i was just impressed with the e and kea mata com i liked it i think it looks like theyve been playing together for for years not and ketcher coming in for his first game and i think thats just given them the lift that they needed theyve dealt with the gaye stuff now thats all done results havent been great but now theyve got eneter in and hes giving him that extra bit which they lost when they lost to lisay i think they have a little bit too much for manu in attack theyre still b new defenders few injuries could be right you could be right i think that itd be good if that clicks im love eddie i think hes great i wish forest signed him so i do wish him well there and i think he could click in this game and the first goal is around the corner like i said so i can see i can see palace tur them over i think it is the fixtures where you the home style end get behind palace theres a big atmosphere there and theyve got goals in them for sure what united can do at the other end ive gone a draw but maybe sit on the fence i do like the 21 next to the big one its the big one next the black box derby black box derby chris phillips says an arrow brighton win as phillip says an arrow brighton win mark suin what a surprise says a forest win i dont know i you couldnt score against it witch so why do you think youre going to score against forest thats what that would be the simple question but i do think we can catch you as well i think weve got some threats and i do youve got threats but the trouble is you talk about matoma but weve just seen how well moro dealt with salah so i dont necess think mata is going to be as dangerous to us as he can be against other teams so i think defensively our fullbacks are good in good form and our center backs are great as well we got caught one n at your place with a ridiculous setpiece goal last time out i dont think well get caught like that again and i do think going forward were were got we got some confidence and some weapons there so i think itd be a good game i hope it is i think its i think its going to be a decent game to watch i dont know why i made it the garden center game im in a im going to madrid this week and i know no we tried to get tickets but it wasnt it wasnt possible i think we were offered to go to athletico to see atletico play but id rather id rather see real madrid and i dont want to miss as pathetic as it sounds i dont want to miss brighton v forest i dont want to miss man city b arsenal youre gonna watch the games when youre out there but you gonna be there with your like noted hany and your union jack boxers in a in a pub watching the football no ill be in my brighton ill ill be full bright kit full brighton kit god as abroad do i want to know i know its not great anyway thats the black box st thats always a good one shane we still havent been to see one in person no we cant do it we got to make sure we get to one and then we can do a vlog when were there so i think its february the 1 foresty brighton right make sure you make it yes definitely well get you a seat dont worry well do hospitality as i said well get hospitality in the new weve got those new have you seen it the new container things weve used shipping containers we turn shipping containers into a new hospitality suite its pretty old its as good as it sounds right but its like 300 quid and im thinking id do that for the black box i was about to say as a joke probably with the all owner to be about 300 quid and it say exactly how much he was 300 quid a ticket and im like lets give it a go im curious as to what its like what in a match inside a shipping container it attach like a massive crane that like spins around thatd be fun it ill send you pictures its not pretty theres pictures of what its going to look like but it doesnt look like that at the moment and its in the corner i dont want to sit there for the black box stby we should do it for a laugh it be quite funny okay im in sounds good final game of the week is man city v arsenal weve both gone for an on the fence draw i come for a nil this just both teams dont want to lose nil youve got thats it isnt it because its early in the season and my feeling is that arteta will go there and think okay were were rice is back but od guys still out would he take a draw there youve got to think he would right youve got to think you got to think this is a must not lose for both teams to because its about its about the psychology of what that would mean for the winner and so if theyre both going to go home thinking what its i must not lose the likely outcome is a nil isnt it ive gone one all id like to think there is a goal in it but you could be you could be right if i was picking the fixture thats most likely to be nil it would be that one i think i agree you could maybe argue like sthampton ipswitch as well is a similar must not lose but i think both teams will mistakes i think i think i switch will fancy the chances against so might attack a bit more and and mistakes like you mentioned was it which game was it last season when arsenal absolutely dominated city and then still managed to lose it was that at the etti had or was that the city arsenal i dont dont i dont know what i dont know where it was i cant i cant recall i think i think it was at the ettihad i think it was aral went there and should have won it and ended up losing it and that was ultimately what cost him the leag so id love if arsenal got a result i would and i think it would be good for the premier league as well because i think that the pace at city is setting is already a little bit worry and its a bit its bit like i said about fbl its like we want it we dont want it to be we dont want city to run away with it so the last result we want is a city home win arsenal out push back and then with the odard injury that could impact them and psych psychologically as well losing this game so the best result for the neutral probably would be an arsenal win yep if you want to get involved in the blackbox predictions you can you can join our patreon theres still time to get in patreoncom blackbox weve got a website where we track all the predictions of all the members and ourselves we predicted 40 matches now mark is currently in the lead but only by two points you get one point for a correct outcome three points for a correct score very close ive got slightly better out comes but youve had i think one or two more correct scores so theres not much it look at hottin though ian we talked about him last week crazy 73 correct outcomes blood l is absolutely ridiculous what is he hopefully i dont want dont wish anyone to gamble but hopefully he makes some money out of his of his predictive powers because thats crazy get involved if youre interested in that there still time also join the sleeper pick him league as well thats correct outcomes too and monthly prizes or prizes worth up to 500 a month completely free to play link in the youtube description below al an overall prize for that but get involved in that if you havent already captaincy as i said interesting week this week harland is top of all the metrics no surprise but has the hardest game the daya is wrong in this as well the xgi is still wrong in this by the way we wont mention that we dont need i figured out what i did i figured out what i did by the way in my workings i added xg to xgi rather than xa to xg so the columns were wrong and that was caused by the cost tab malaky that i spoke to you about so i will correct it i will correct it updated tables so off it wont happen again and i know exactly why its happened and apologies every week i hear about that cost that cost tab in scout its caus you no end of problems isnt it its fine its its fine ive sorted it now its on the chart anymore dont worry dont wor its fine its salah isnt it is there a conversation here around that most managers now have got salah even with harland there in their team most have moved that way as well if you dont salah you probably would go harlem wouldnt you lets face it i think its watkins harem salah thats the three do you sal what have we got what have we got in the matrix for this week bring that up lets have a look i think i probably had those three as well son okay so salah watkins son i dont know i dont know if we saw enough on son though no you think his spurs win son should get a return at of that because hes on pens and he is central to their attack hes not central because hes playing out left but i think its its because of what harlands done so far if you dont have sal its its very difficult not to say that harlands not the second choice right next week as well we havent got harand highlighted here he probably is entering into that bracket but salahs got sacks got leicester watkins has got ipswitch again thats a three great you would think that those three are stronger captain c options in harland in a normal env situation but its just what weve seen so far is just ridiculously crazy and then look at that run though look and gw seven onwards its hard to question captain in maybe brighten away but you are definitely going to captain harland fulham wolves santon bournemouth i would bri away there you go so this is why the i havent got harland yet ive got to think about wild cards in i game week six or certainly game week seven i think because of that run and the damage he can do in that run is pretty considerable i thought and when where did you go to the captaincy you get to game with kate and its a problem this is your team for the next game week you mentioned the wild card as well you got that on the on the radar but let me know your whats your thoughts what you thinking well i think i dont think i do anything this week i dont necessarily need to un unless i hear isach or xia pedro are out because i think that im not booking in the wild card game week six if i was i dead end something into game week six it might be that id take two transfers into six and then get watkins and mumo in for son and wiissa right which i could and then go without harland at newcastle and hope that sacka covers the captaincy which he could do so i think what ill do is not ill probably hold this so its reyya coner trent pedro poo sacka e salah son rogers isak and jal pedro if that 11 are fit ill probably just go in with that save the transfer and then decide whether i wild card next week and take the extra transfers through or whether i make transfer next week and wild card ahead of seven y but i could ive looked at wild card this week i dont think its worth it i dont think i want to move to harlem when hes got arsenal so its more likely i do it in six when hes got newcastle or seven when hes got fulham at home i think hes hes probably the likely outcome so i dont see a transfer here i could do wher to calv lein ive got not one in the bank but then who do i who do i pull out maybe xia pedro if hes not going to be fit theres talk that he wasnt training today again so i dont know what you what do you make of that what would you do there i think if theres doubts around lak and pedro going into the weekends i think i would probably look to move wher out and have that as a good because you dont your team no offense isnt looking that strong this week and if g pedros gonna miss out and robinsons gonna come in id think id much rather have an option of a calv lein or a vardy in case that was that was going to happen but its the thing is the only major difference between my team and other peoples is harand playing arsenal because most harland teams have got well they most harland teams have got salah but they havent got sacka so its only looking i dont dont know i dispute the fact it looks weak because in a all week it would because harlands got gna score goals but its not true and there not so i dont think it looks weak because its as good as any other team the only thing thats missing is harland playing arsenal which i dont know you could say well thats a major problem but id like to think it isnt because of all the games against arsenal i would say that could be the one where i can think well hes only gon to get one goal maximan so i dont think its weak i think its okay but the problem ive got is my differentials are sacka and son and i dont see necessarily see son getting me anything and sacka probably wont do anything either because hes playing city so i dont have anything there thats going to help me make up ground because people have got har got sol so i might get a green arrow but its not going to be its not going to be a game which helps me make up ground so i accept that but i dont think im going to lose ground unless haren goes crazy sur which he could this is it he could so i think that it all depends on whether those flags come off i think saaka will be fine because hes playing tonight right so i think isaks fine because just blur vision so i dont think thats a problem unless it was concussion and its xia pedro and if if shia pedros out im tempted to do it anyway because i dont necessar think brighton are going to score many goals against thats what i was about to say are you not tell just to get rid of the whistle problem and bring in another cheaper striker its caval zill though isnt he so youve got that so hes flag as well is or its v or its who was the other or would bringing bring you bringing in chris be the ultimate turnaround i just i just think id rather have the two transfers next week and then decide that gives me the option to wild card or not whereas i they use a transfer this week ive got a wild card next week i think thats true because id be going s in bumo and having three million in the bank and i dont want to do that whereas i if i have two transfers i can go s and bumo wier to watkins and that is then a team where i can go well maybe i can go about harlem one more week and hope that sacka watkins they will be differentials or salah could be a differential because you think that many teams are going to go salah to sacka dont you so i could have a decent team with two transfers next week that makes me think i havent necessarily got go harland but he could destroy newcastle can he this is the thing hes like it hes dominant and its a shame because it does limit our possibilities a bit now well im im in im in a similar dilemma of when im going to when im going to walk card as well cuz i think my team is all right for game week six i probably wont have s well i wont have sacka unless i sell but i can get to an arsenal defender so ive got henderson in goal with trent porro and robinson salah captain jotter gordon rogers harland mateta who was a problem i thought might be a problem for me hes now i think quite a good asset out nowhere and g pedro and then ive got smith row on the bench who can come in if pedro is out my first thoughts were to were to roll earlier in the week and then i could do salah to sacka and tedson to raya for two threee trans for two free transfers that means losing salah against wolves but gets me two arsenal players at home to its southampton first isnt it and then and then lester which i like the look of but i am thinking that jotter is a problem so i could do jotter to mumo and then id still have the money to do porro to next week next week so i would i would role this youre playing robinson at home to newcastle which is probably the only weakness here cu if xia pedros not fit he got smith row so theres not theres not any other weakness there i would say other than maybe jotter but we just dont know how thats going to go do we its he loves him but there is a threat there now for sure do i do i give j one more week or do i bring in inoma who im going to want anyway from game week six well you give j this week i think you think ill give him this week i would because hes g to get a le half an hour true and boomo at spurs could he could he could do well at spurs thats the thing its but i would i would probably hold jota for this week see what happens i do like the idea of getting ry in for henderson because then that gets rid of that goalkeeping problem gets me gets me the arsenal defender who i want the most selling salah isnt ideal but im getting in saaka whos lets be honest a pretty good replacement with the two home games hes got so but then im still on to j so if js then a problem from next week then it might be wild card time because thatll be three transfers and i can get rid of robinson i can clear up my bench a little bit you got johnson there when are you gonna play it if you dont play it next week i know so it could it could and i like the fact that i could i can keep the two three transfers and still play it now and still keep those two three transfers was in previous years id be decid id need to make a transfer this week and then wocks i couldnt hold and then and then wild card so its leicester before southampton first so its a slightly not its the slightly worst game of it two but still pretty good im probably gonna roll anyway both us rolling brilliant both us rolling fun all that all that all that analysis and were both were both rolling thats pretty much it from us weve got a couple of super chats to answer it weve got this is just a message from super duper fc whos been a member for 30 months of the youtube channel thank you he says yellen and marks vlogs are the weekly entertainment yellers are good i like some of her transition she uses very clever shes got lots of ideas and its good its good i enjoy doing i think like we both got the same camera arent we so we both use the same god she loves it she hasnt got the drone though ive invested in a little drone to help me do the gta type shots behind me which is cool but so ill be doing it ive got to find a spot in brighton on sunday morning so im looking forward to doing it in brighton see where i can do didnt have she didnt have any time when she went because we were so late so theres no footage god no its the only thing about it is it means i spend monday night editing the video which means tuesday night im rushing doing the data and then i get the xg data wrong so thats my fault so i need to sort i keep say teach me how to do the tables and i can help out but i know i know well sort out so i thats rattled me tonight getting that wrong because its the first time its happened i dont think weve ever had the data wrong like that so apologies i will get correct we have thanks because you were rattled then its very rare dont get me wrong but it has it has fair its its exel its so easy to break it is y new member atab boy thank you new member nigel the crab dont understand that left and joined again left and joined thats a understandable heroic doses thank you for the super chat i get the rule but triple sub here we go triple sub 5920 jotter gets one because hes off first diaz gets three because hes off at 605 imagine they were defenders fbo equals a clown show it is a ridiculous rule ridiculous i think it should be when the ball goes up thats the minute 100 100 because then it then its about like who walks the quickest or who furthest i was saying to pra well thats great marginal game because diaz is on the wing so therefore jos has willing the sh distance but it shouldnt come down to that should its absolutely crazy did someone say its just poor like x steps or x grass thats youre right the swing for a defender would have been massive wouldnt it and like imagine trent and robertson and robertson is over there and trents nearest so trent goes off sooner robertson makes it a bit of a distance and he gets a clean sheet that it could happened because hes taken them both off he took them both off at his didnt he i think at the end he did so it they wouldnt go off on 60 minutes maybe but it is still a very silly rule so do it when the ball comes up not when the player steps over the line its got ive won ive won two leagues in the past by one point one against you and one when i was in the cash league years ago i know thats the point thats the two points and i was robbed of that because of the edit an assist did you have to bring that up again i thought that was awful on saturday no harand got that second goal and i thought who got the assist bloody edison of all they rubbing it in they gave it straight away as well ming around no doubt course maliky fox thank you hi as a mark jackson to calv lein for a hit not for a hit no id keep i wouldnt want jackson particularly but if youve got him id keep him not for a hit i just dont think like i said the dcla gets the fitness its longterm i worry about him getting match after match after match and so i think hes good for a couple of weeks but as hes ear already so whats behind that i want to you need to get a bit of that before for sure but its the hit its the four points youre putting pressure on to score one straight away which hes not that prolific that you can do that yep no i agree not for me and the final one is from p lassen again thank you for the super chat should i do vardy to wood or hold wood longterm it means wood to vardy or hold w no id keep wood so i i think that aan is still some time away from being the starter and i think wood can cause you a few problems and well create for him hes not brilliant in the buildup but hes there to finish things and well create for him and we got some good fixtures to come so hold him for sure y at boy says like the stream lads and gals is a small effort but for as mark very helpful y if you havent liked already do give us a like do drop us a comment and if you are listening on podcast give us a festar review if youve enjoyed it because again those this is the place im reliable xg data so where else would you rather be than watching two men talk about wrong xg days some grand people moaning that fbl is broken because he had a bad game week thats what you want right thats it well i dont like your team this week so i dont think youre going to be that happy next week thanks a lot i dont know i dont understand who what team looks much better than that mil it sorry i dont think its no watkins maybe could go off i know to be fair is i dont think its going to be a very high score scoring week so youll probably get away with that no probably not it depends how that arsenal city game goes doesnt it because we are reliant on those assets reliant on those assets without ry and sakur have done awfully without harand lot of managers would have done awfully so it shows you how alarm weve become on arsenal and city already this season so well see i think salah will come good i think i think therell be points in that game for everyone whos on salah but im not holding my breath for summer returns but well see stranger things have happened they have well and i would say good luck in the black boox derby but i dont mean it get i will be messaging you so make sure you get your phone sorted out in madrid because i want to be able to send you photos on the ground of us celebrating and i wish we go together good game a good game nice that its getting closer between the two teams because when we came up the thought of sharing the match with you watching forest getting beaten but now i think by the time we get to it like you come to the city ground i think thats going to be i think its tight now between our teams so yes do i am proud that forest have made progress and closed the gap a bit and you never know you made the europa league maybe we can maybe were not too far away either well see i think matt said to me where do we think we finished and i said probably like ninth and 10th its probably realistic good be right with that mark absolute pleasure as always ill see you again next week enjoy the game well i hope so unless i have another miserable game week then i might retire and no dont say that have to do it bloody handy that this all good its all good thanks right ill see you again good night for me night everyone,25096
27,FPLBlackBox,W7RXnwehNsE,FPL Not Enough | GW4,2024-09-16T20:07:27Z,[Music] [Music] [Music] it's game week four it's Sunday morning it's absolutely glorious Sunday morning and I'm still very much riding the high of forest 1 n win at anfield yesterday I'm just a little worried that when that high wears off I'm going to wake up screaming and bursting into tears at the fact that Harland again wrecked my game week with a double figure return it's just absolutely incredible I don't know I mean obviously I'm beginning to near the point where I'm waving the white flag on Harland I look at it now and think probably enough couple of game weeks is all I can go more on that and a set but let's look at the stats from City 2-1 win over brenford it went how I thought it would to be honest close game in terms of result brenford took that shot lead through V's goal I had him on the bench third on the bench of course no luck there um but um yeah I was never going to start him at Man City over Robinson at home to West Ham so I forgive myself that and harand got the brace of course um XG have w 1.11 six shots in the game he's now had 20 shots over the season that's almost double ever any other forward and 73% of his shots have been on target 45% of them converted into goals that that's not sustainable Mark of course that's what I keep telling myself that's what I told myself in blackbox this week if you saw it but he just keeps delivering he's an absolute machine and if anything City without foden um without other goal options in the side really and foden does provide the other main source of goals I would say it's just all about Highland it's all about feeding Harland even more than we've seen before and he looks in Peak physical condition absolute you know the fear he's causing in defenses I mean pincky just pushed off the ball for that second goal it wasn't great defending but that's what you're going to get against harand he's just a beast and it's Arsenal at home Newcastle way so I guess I can take some consolation that perhaps I can wait two game weeks before I have to make the move but then the game we seven definitely eight I need to get in there because of City's fixtur so it's getting close to the moment where I have to kind of concede the feat on that and see if I can ride out the next two game weeks elsewhere in the game kdb again showed up well but um came out of it with nothing 3.38 xgi now for the season that's the most of any midfielder uh and in terms of Team selection Lewis did start he started on the left and inverted even though Walker was in the side bought back on the right but um then he was subbed at halftime leis Fardo and this is what we're going to see now I think with European fixtures on the agenda for Pep he's going to play of his lineups more and everything we thought we knew about their team which looked quite settled we're going to have to relearn a bit now that the European fixtures are are with us as for brenford wher picked up the injury and that's a blow for early adopters like me who need in for game week six onwards when brenford fixtures really turn we'll have to see how bad that ankle injury is what does that mean it could mean starts for Sharda who replaced him up front it could mean LS poter plays there does it impact in bmo's output could do this would be a big loss let's face it so we'll have to get the prognosis from Frank on that and then the other thing of not set vandenbberg is he going to be the for in Defender that we need I mean brenford fixtures are great people are presuming now that he's got that start but they do play three at the back against the harder tires so against easier opposition the type of opposition you want a brenford Defender for it's not certain that vandenbberg starts I think he I think he probably will claim start because he's a quality player and I might if I was ward in now I might take a risk on him but we need more info we need a couple more games before we can be sure for brenford run that Vandenberg could be the formula option of choice if he does drop in that' be great for [Music] us see if Salah had delivered it wouldn't have been so bad for me and and certainly for for others who have backed Salah over Harland but obviously Salah got a lot of traffic going into the game week as well but I watched The Forest game and Forest just contained him and Diaz really well I mean the fullbacks were outstanding Salah was very quiet he had three shots Diaz had one but neither really threatened that much Diaz had that one chance that Yates gave up which perhaps he could have done better with but a blank for the Liverpool attack uh and for Trent obviously with the H and Ado goal Trent created four chances and you know it's just a bad day for Liverpool there's no fear going into Bournemouth walles Palace and Chelsea that Liverpool assets won't reward us but I think what I saw in that game was real concern that Salah could so could so easily be shut down if you like I mean for has played well but there is certainly much more chance that Salah is going to be stopped than Harland it seems based on the evidence we've seen so far um and Forest I mean maybe I'm underestimating them and I'm trying not to be biased as a forest fan and and back Forest too much but defensively we were excellent and that's two clean sheets now and SS with five saves as well Moro made his full debut now if I was going a forest Defender it probably would be olena um because I think you know the fact that Moreno played left and Ana moved to the right that's a sign of things to come I think Ana has got the right back slot and he's more natural out there but Moreno his attacking qualities are going to be really tempting if he can now down that start and he was outstanding I just don't see um I don't see him giving up that left back birth now so Forest could be worth a look they they're up there with the defensive date last season they're up there this season and maybe I need to like not do you know not do them down because I'm a forest fan but actually see them for what their potential is in fbl which is perhaps a very solid defensive unit uh let's touch on a player that did deliver and that was OE Watkins I mean we went into this period of fixtures for Villa thinking that Watkins would be a target for us we were put off by the fact he's been taken off on 60 Minutes in in most of the games not so this time I mean Villa had to push they went two nil down to Everton Everton again letting that twoo lead go um but um yeah Watkins played his part with a brace of course um and then Duran with a wonder goal Watkins had six shots 1.25 xgi um and it's what we expected really over that period of those fixtures but we were just hesitant weren't we but now going forward um the fixtures remain good for Villa um and it's walls in its witch next and you got to think that yeah would you move to Watkins I guess he could be an alternative now certainly the captaincy for those who did were brave enough to put him put it on him got rewards um certainly you're going to hold your Villa assets aren't you and that includes Rogers who who is turning into somewhat of a troll it's ironic that the the classic troll Dina got the assist for the first goal and then we got Rogers in the team who just seems to be flirting constantly with with returns in fbl without actually delivering um I think he had three shots one chance created looked impressive again but came out of the game with absolutely nothing Elsewhere for Everton not too much to say really defensively they remain a real noo so pford just isn't going to be doesn't look to be an option for us and at 5 million perhaps he wasn't anyway the only other thing I note for ever is C becoming an option 5.9 they've got Leicester Palace Newcastle and that's a good run um if we need a 5.9 Striker maybe Cal L is someone we got to consider but at the moment confidence in that Everton Camp's got to be a concern [Music] [Music] enough a blank for eza and um heartbreak for me because he was my transfer in for first Smith row uh again he flirted with returns 0.80 his XG in the game but came out with nothing um he's had 18 shots for the season I think that's second only to seeno um from midfielders but no returns and significantly didn't take the penalty that maretta converted to get his brace very painful for me that with as having Mareta of course um so I mean after the game glasner said that they've got two penalty takers and they decide on the pitch so that's a lot of use to us isn't it but as an EO owner expecting to get penalties a part of his appeal that that is a little bit of a concern now but of course his data remains fantastic maretta um got four shots on the day 0.58 XG excellent performance by him but overshadowed in terms of the data by enet who made his debut with with six shots uh 0.57 he looks promising and the three of them as a front three look you know really quite potent uh are going to cause people problems and I think you know you're going to be holding your Palace assets going into these next two games it's Man United and everon they should be out of profit and score goals in those games whether they K clean sheets though is another matter Henderson a very popular four five option at start of the Season that fought for the first goal um and yeah I think the defensively Palace don't look sound at all it's in attack that we're going to remain [Music] invested Bruno owners get a return at last in the 3-0 win at sampton um five shots one chance great the data was there again for Bruno 0.57 xgi in the game but I guess that the early adopters are are looking to move away from him in wild cards now because the output just hasn't been there for him and United as a team um you know just not attracted investment at the moment Z she was the uh top performer for XJ 1.17 but came out of it with nothing gacho got a goal Off the Bench the6 chances created so the data is there but I just think in terms of attacking assets we're not going to look at United at the moment I it's Crystal Palace Spurs and Villa so the fixtures really aren't in their favor either um clean sheets maybe they've kept two now so maybe the defense with theit of course getting the goal um so maybe defensively that's where we would go on United but with those fixtures probably not yet as Southampton the the headlines for them if there were any were around the budget assets 4.5 diblin made his debut in Midfield looked really Lively won a penalty that was missed by Archer uh and he could be an answer if you're looking for a far five option maybe you go him over Winks but of course from a 4 five mid you're looking for a short start and I don't think we can say that much yet diblin is a good player I think he will break through and now down to start because he did look their most exciting prospect and most creative um Outlet in the game I would say until he was subbed elsewhere har Bellis was um benched which was a surprise as Russell Martin moved to for at the back and I guess that's a concern now although he has got stay of execution cuz Steven's got the red card he'll be out for free games so if you are a haror Bellis owner you're okay for now you're getting the way of it for now but um I think his future as a 4 million asset for us is in doubt if it wasn't already given how many goals they're conceded [Music] [Music] [Music] strange game at Bournemouth um Chelsea got the the win bit of a smash and grab with a late goal Redemption Arc for in kunu and for jayen Sancho I guess Sancho getting the assist for inu's goal obviously be flooding out of teams in recent game weeks due to the expected minutes but came off the bench of 18 minutes to go took the goal well um but just a bizarre game overall not a lot you can take from it I mean I was on pal watch but really disappointed by what I saw no shots one chance created um and this is the problem like if if Harland isn't going to dominate as a captain we're going to need players like Palmer to step up and that wasn't really a good audition for our teams what we saw at Bournemouth and just some stats based on this season versus last minutes per xgi this season 1 94.4 compared to 98.4 last season and okay that includes penalties but let's look at touches in the Box it's it's 1.8 this season so far compared to 4.1 last season so we're not seeing as yet data or the it test to convince us that Palmer is going to be a second tier asset that can make it worth spreading the funds if you don't have Harland and Salah um so yeah I'm I'm concerned about Palmer at the moment I'm not going to make the move West Ham Brighton Forest next so you're going to you're going to hold on to uh to your Chelsea assets but um I don't know uh I want more from Palmer for sure as for Bournemouth seeno and tavanir still remain good 5.5 targets um seeno had three shots in the game it just wasn't bourus just bourus night was it and Chelsea managed to grind out the result Sanchez the leading perform on the night with the penalty save 15 points well done if you if you move to Sanchez in the wild card or before uh and perhaps defensively that's where we're going to look at moresa side at the moment but only just one clean sheet it's early days and like I've been saying in all these videos that's a work in progress and I'm just not going there [Music] yet so F and one westand one was a more predictable result uh in the game week I I don't think so I exactly what I expected really um no massive standouts from it Smith row came out with six points got the assists for the goal and of course I went into the game we excelling in Forza so I lost out there but yeah's he's doing exactly what we'd expect from a 5.5 asset he showed up really well three shots three chances created was subed again on 73 minutes so his his expected minutes is a bit of an issue but he's clearly the the best asset for Fulham at the moment and um alongside Robinson I guess in in defense Robinson had his clean sheet cruy taken off him um by that last minute goal or late goal by Danny Ying set up by boen um and I guess the other point of note was munes was dropped to the bench and it's not surprising really he 43 shots of had a goal he had been struggling I think he he'd had um he was second to Harem for shots I think he still is even without playing yesterday um but R jenez came in got his goal and I think it's it shirt to lose now while he stays fit so that's a problem if you got on munz as your six million Striker option I think you've got to move off him now um elsewhere West Ham not too much to attract to attract to us to them at the moment I mean boen is going to be a differential over the season at some point but just not yet I don't think it's Chelsea and brenford and the fixtures just haven't been great for West Ham for us to consider them the final game was was Brighton and itswitch which we expected to be a comfortable home win but itswitch put up a a real strong away performance to get another valuable point and um the goals just didn't come atoma did okay fre shots 0.67 he was the top xgi performer out of the game um but Brighton just couldn't couldn't break through that that rear guard and um it was dap who hit the post fit he's showing up okay as as a cheap Striker by the way and when the fixtures now turn for it which maybe him and Davis are worth a look as for Brighton no Jal Pedro was the headline of course came back from International Duty we thought he was going to get some minutes but didn't even appear he's got a knock I don't think it's serious and and of course the fact that Brighton didn't take their chances didn't score it should bode well for him to come back in against forest provid and of course that injury isn't more [Music] serious all right I'm going to go back join the family and then get back on watch the north London derbyan wolves Newcastle next I've got four players yet to play son sacka Reya and isaach oh God I need something from them I mean best case I would be what 20 plus points worst case scenario eight or nine really need them to come in for me otherwise it's going to be one of the worst game weeks I've ever had I think I'm ranked like 9 million or something in the game week at the moment and as he's living it up after his Harland Hall and maretta points so yeah it's going to be a miserable Black Box in the week for me unless I get something today so let's hope that best case comes in eh 19 points in not what I needed but good enough I suppose in this game week was so many blanks about um sacka was seven points Ry with nine and then just a couple was s then one from isach talk about that in a minute but yeah sacka came in with the set piece 0.40 he was top X dve performer on the day but it's not enough for him he's a 10 million asset I need more and then the same than son one shot one chance created 0.17 XT that's just not good enough I mean with hard being so dominant we need more from those assets to really justify not just going har and Salah so yeah it's a problem for me that's for sure and I've got to look at what I do with son long term as for sakur he got a knock but I think he'll be okay I don't think he's made of tungsten and he he's going to be fine he plays 90 minutes most of the time and and Arsenal flog him so I'm sure that he's going to he's going to be fine for game week five um what else in the game yeah Gabrielle exploiting the set peace threat um really hurting know who benched him or even sold him for this game I can see why people did low and played porro for example porro you know he's second to Trent for chances Crea for defense he's he's top for shots so the attacking threat was there but against this Aral defense just they never looked like breaking through did they and so yeah Gabriel with 15 points of that that probably hurt quite a few people out there that I've seen um and then Rya I mean what would I do without Riya again clean sheet and two bonus five saves he's with turned an average of two bonus points every time Arsenal kept the clean seat so far which wasn't what we expected but I thank my lucky stars that he is in my team because he is really plugging the gaps at the [Music] moment suay concluded with walls one Newcastle 2 real real again Newcastle not looking great but managing to get the result um thanks to Barns coming off the bench and hitting a wonder goal at the end um I guess the the headline act here is that he that was off at half time he took a blow to the face and and how said after an eye injury he'd already gone down overnight to uh to 84 and and now another price drop could be on the card for him I think I think I have to hold him and and hope that game week five he be fine for the for the Fulham game that's a fixture where he could do okay and Newcastle just finding a way despite not playing well but it's like I've said before it's these teams Chelsea Spurs Newcastle these are teams that are giving us Assets in that mid to second tier bracket they need to be playing better than they are um because until they do find some form and some fluidity we can't expect the light to vak and son and Palmer to make the contributions that we need them to at the price bracket they are so I'm going to look at more of that in Wednesday's blackbox we'll be doing blackbox on Wednesday a bit earlier not looking forward to it cuz I go into blackbox for the first time in ages being behind as by 20 points it's it's a strange feeling I don't I don't like it um so a is going to be celebrating I'm going to try and keep the show short so I'm going to go off now and watch that Hudson Ado go another 15 times to cheer myself up don't forget to like And subscribe and see you next time,3919,its game week four its sunday morning its absolutely glorious sunday morning and im still riding the high of forest 1 n win at anfield yesterday im just a little worried that when that high wears off im going to wake up screaming and bursting into tears at the fact that harland again wrecked my game week with a double figure return its just absolutely incredible i dont know im beginning to near the point where im waving the white flag on harland i look at it now and think probably enough couple of game weeks is all i can go more on that and a set but lets look at the stats from city 21 win over brenford it went how i thought it would to be honest close game in terms of result brenford took that shot lead through vs goal i had him on the bench third on the bench of course no luck there but i was never going to start him at man city over robinson at home to west ham so i forgive myself that and harand got the brace of course xg have w 111 six shots in the game hes now had 20 shots over the season thats almost double ever any other forward and 73 of his shots have been on target 45 of them converted into goals thats not sustainable mark of course thats what i keep telling myself thats what i told myself in blackbox this week if you saw it but he just keeps delivering hes an absolute machine and if anything city without foden without other goal options in the side and foden does provide the other main source of goals i would say its just all about highland its all about feeding harland even more than weve seen before and he looks in peak physical condition absolute the fear hes causing in defenses pincky just pushed off the ball for that second goal it wasnt great defending but thats what youre going to get against harand hes just a beast and its arsenal at home newcastle way so i can take some consolation that perhaps i can wait two game weeks before i have to make the move but then the game we seven definitely eight i need to get in there because of citys fixtur so its getting close to the moment where i have to concede the feat on that and see if i can ride out the next two game weeks elsewhere in the game kdb again showed up well but came out of it with nothing 338 xgi now for the season thats the most of any midfielder and in terms of team selection lewis did start he started on the left and inverted even though walker was in the side bought back on the right but then he was subbed at halftime leis fardo and this is what were going to see now i think with european fixtures on the agenda for pep hes going to play of his lineups more and everything we thought we knew about their team which looked quite settled were going to have to relearn a bit now that the european fixtures are with us as for brenford wher picked up the injury and thats a blow for early adopters like me who need in for game week six onwards when brenford fixtures turn well have to see how bad that ankle injury is what does that mean it could mean starts for sharda who replaced him up front it could mean ls poter plays there does it impact in bmos output could do this would be a big loss lets face it so well have to get the prognosis from frank on that and then the other thing of not set vandenbberg is he going to be the for in defender that we need brenford fixtures are great people are presuming now that hes got that start but they do play three at the back against the harder tires so against easier opposition the type of opposition you want a brenford defender for its not certain that vandenbberg starts i think he i think he probably will claim start because hes a quality player and i might if i was ward in now i might take a risk on him but we need more info we need a couple more games before we can be sure for brenford run that vandenberg could be the formula option of choice if he does drop in that be great for us see if salah had delivered it wouldnt have been so bad for me and certainly for others who have backed salah over harland but salah got a lot of traffic going into the game week as well but i watched the forest game and forest just contained him and diaz well the fullbacks were outstanding salah was very quiet he had three shots diaz had one but neither threatened that much diaz had that one chance that yates gave up which perhaps he could have done better with but a blank for the liverpool attack and for trent with the h and ado goal trent created four chances and its just a bad day for liverpool theres no fear going into bournemouth walles palace and chelsea that liverpool assets wont reward us but i think what i saw in that game was real concern that salah could so could so easily be shut down if you like for has played well but there is certainly much more chance that salah is going to be stopped than harland it seems based on the evidence weve seen so far and forest maybe im underestimating them and im trying not to be biased as a forest fan and back forest too much but defensively we were excellent and thats two clean sheets now and ss with five saves as well moro made his full debut now if i was going a forest defender it probably would be olena because i think the fact that moreno played left and ana moved to the right thats a sign of things to come i think ana has got the right back slot and hes more natural out there but moreno his attacking qualities are going to be tempting if he can now down that start and he was outstanding i just dont see i dont see him giving up that left back birth now so forest could be worth a look theyre up there with the defensive date last season theyre up there this season and maybe i need to like not do not do them down because im a forest fan but see them for what their potential is in fbl which is perhaps a very solid defensive unit lets touch on a player that did deliver and that was oe watkins we went into this period of fixtures for villa thinking that watkins would be a target for us we were put off by the fact hes been taken off on 60 minutes in most of the games not so this time villa had to push they went two nil down to everton again letting that twoo lead go but watkins played his part with a brace of course and then duran with a wonder goal watkins had six shots 125 xgi and its what we expected over that period of those fixtures but we were just hesitant werent we but now going forward the fixtures remain good for villa and its walls in its witch next and you got to think that would you move to watkins he could be an alternative now certainly the captaincy for those who did were brave enough to put him put it on him got rewards certainly youre going to hold your villa assets arent you and that includes rogers who is turning into somewhat of a troll its ironic that the classic troll dina got the assist for the first goal and then we got rogers in the team who just seems to be flirting constantly with returns in fbl without delivering i think he had three shots one chance created looked impressive again but came out of the game with absolutely nothing elsewhere for everton not too much to say defensively they remain a real noo so pford just isnt going to be doesnt look to be an option for us and at 5m perhaps he wasnt anyway the only other thing i note for ever is c becoming an option 59 theyve got leicester palace newcastle and thats a good run if we need a 59 striker maybe cal l is someone we got to consider but at the moment confidence in that everton camps got to be a concern enough a blank for eza and heartbreak for me because he was my transfer in for first smith row again he flirted with returns 080 his xg in the game but came out with nothing hes had 18 shots for the season i think thats second only to seeno from midfielders but no returns and significantly didnt take the penalty that maretta converted to get his brace very painful for me that with as having mareta of course so after the game glasner said that theyve got two penalty takers and they decide on the pitch so thats a lot of use to us isnt it but as an eo owner expecting to get penalties a part of his appeal that is a little bit of a concern now but of course his data remains fantastic maretta got four shots on the day 058 xg excellent performance by him but overshadowed in terms of the data by enet who made his debut with six shots 057 he looks promising and the three of them as a front three look quite potent are going to cause people problems and i think youre going to be holding your palace assets going into these next two games its man united and everon they should be out of profit and score goals in those games whether they k clean sheets though is another matter henderson a very popular four five option at start of the season that fought for the first goal and i think the defensively palace dont look sound at all its in attack that were going to remain invested bruno owners get a return at last in the 30 win at sampton five shots one chance great the data was there again for bruno 057 xgi in the game but that the early adopters are looking to move away from him in wild cards now because the output just hasnt been there for him and united as a team just not attracted investment at the moment z she was the top performer for xj 117 but came out of it with nothing gacho got a goal off the bench the6 chances created so the data is there but i just think in terms of attacking assets were not going to look at united at the moment i its crystal palace spurs and villa so the fixtures arent in their favor either clean sheets maybe theyve kept two now so maybe the defense with theit of course getting the goal so maybe defensively thats where we would go on united but with those fixtures probably not yet as southampton the headlines for them if there were any were around the budget assets 45 diblin made his debut in midfield looked lively won a penalty that was missed by archer and he could be an answer if youre looking for a far five option maybe you go him over winks but of course from a 4 five mid youre looking for a short start and i dont think we can say that much yet diblin is a good player i think he will break through and now down to start because he did look their most exciting prospect and most creative outlet in the game i would say until he was subbed elsewhere har bellis was benched which was a surprise as russell martin moved to for at the back and thats a concern now although he has got stay of execution cuz stevens got the red card hell be out for free games so if you are a haror bellis owner youre okay for now youre getting the way of it for now but i think his future as a 4m asset for us is in doubt if it wasnt already given how many goals theyre conceded strange game at bournemouth chelsea got the win bit of a smash and grab with a late goal redemption arc for in kunu and for jayen sancho sancho getting the assist for inus goal be flooding out of teams in recent game weeks due to the expected minutes but came off the bench of 18 minutes to go took the goal well but just a bizarre game overall not a lot you can take from it i was on pal watch but disappointed by what i saw no shots one chance created and this is the problem like if harland isnt going to dominate as a captain were going to need players like palmer to step up and that wasnt a good audition for our teams what we saw at bournemouth and just some stats based on this season versus last minutes per xgi this season 1 944 compared to 984 last season and okay that includes penalties but lets look at touches in the box its its 18 this season so far compared to 41 last season so were not seeing as yet data or the it test to convince us that palmer is going to be a second tier asset that can make it worth spreading the funds if you dont have harland and salah so im im concerned about palmer at the moment im not going to make the move west ham brighton forest next so youre going to youre going to hold on to to your chelsea assets but i dont know i want more from palmer for sure as for bournemouth seeno and tavanir still remain good 55 targets seeno had three shots in the game it just wasnt bourus just bourus night was it and chelsea managed to grind out the result sanchez the leading perform on the night with the penalty save 15 points well done if you if you move to sanchez in the wild card or before and perhaps defensively thats where were going to look at moresa side at the moment but only just one clean sheet its early days and like ive been saying in all these videos thats a work in progress and im just not going there yet so f and one westand one was a more predictable result in the game week i dont think so i exactly what i expected no massive standouts from it smith row came out with six points got the assists for the goal and of course i went into the game we excelling in forza so i lost out there but s hes doing exactly what wed expect from a 55 asset he showed up well three shots three chances created was subed again on 73 minutes so his expected minutes is a bit of an issue but hes clearly the best asset for fulham at the moment and alongside robinson in defense robinson had his clean sheet cruy taken off him by that last minute goal or late goal by danny ying set up by boen and the other point of note was munes was dropped to the bench and its not surprising he 43 shots of had a goal he had been struggling i think hed had he was second to harem for shots i think he still is even without playing yesterday but r jenez came in got his goal and i think its it shirt to lose now while he stays fit so thats a problem if you got on munz as your six million striker option i think youve got to move off him now elsewhere west ham not too much to attract to attract to us to them at the moment boen is going to be a differential over the season at some point but just not yet i dont think its chelsea and brenford and the fixtures just havent been great for west ham for us to consider them the final game was brighton and itswitch which we expected to be a comfortable home win but itswitch put up a real strong away performance to get another valuable point and the goals just didnt come atoma did okay fre shots 067 he was the top xgi performer out of the game but brighton just couldnt couldnt break through that rear guard and it was dap who hit the post fit hes showing up okay as a cheap striker by the way and when the fixtures now turn for it which maybe him and davis are worth a look as for brighton no jal pedro was the headline of course came back from international duty we thought he was going to get some minutes but didnt even appear hes got a knock i dont think its serious and of course the fact that brighton didnt take their chances didnt score it should bode well for him to come back in against forest provid and of course that injury isnt more serious all right im going to go back join the family and then get back on watch the north london derbyan wolves newcastle next ive got four players yet to play son sacka reya and isaach god i need something from them best case i would be what 20 plus points worst case scenario eight or nine need them to come in for me otherwise its going to be one of the worst game weeks ive ever had i think im ranked like 9m in the game week at the moment and as hes living it up after his harland hall and maretta points so its going to be a miserable black box in the week for me unless i get something today so lets hope that best case comes in eh 19 points in not what i needed but good enough in this game week was so many blanks about sacka was seven points ry with nine and then just a couple was s then one from isach talk about that in a minute but sacka came in with the set piece 040 he was top x dve performer on the day but its not enough for him hes a 10m asset i need more and then the same than son one shot one chance created 017 xt thats just not good enough with hard being so dominant we need more from those assets to justify not just going har and salah so its a problem for me thats for sure and ive got to look at what i do with son long term as for sakur he got a knock but i think hell be okay i dont think hes made of tungsten and hes going to be fine he plays 90 minutes most of the time and arsenal flog him so im sure that hes going to hes going to be fine for game week five what else in the game gabrielle exploiting the set peace threat hurting know who benched him or even sold him for this game i can see why people did low and played porro for example porro hes second to trent for chances crea for defense hes hes top for shots so the attacking threat was there but against this aral defense just they never looked like breaking through did they and so gabriel with 15 points of that probably hurt

the clean seat so far which wasnt what we expected but i thank my lucky stars that he is in my team because he is plugging the gaps at the moment suay concluded with walls one newcastle 2 real again newcastle not looking great but managing to get the result thanks to barns coming off the bench and hitting a wonder goal at the end the headline act here is that he that was off at half time he took a blow to the face and how said after an eye injury hed already gone down overnight to to 84 and now another price drop could be on the card for him i think i think i have to hold him and hope that
