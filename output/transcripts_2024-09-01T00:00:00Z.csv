yeah just got going yep uh yeah so 74 um it was above average uh but it's still a red arrow so I've had only red arrows to start of the season so that's not gone great um but um yeah Salah coming in clutch at the end of the week um thankfully to to match Holland and um yeah bench Pedro against Arsenal I think I I was never really going to play him I don't think so um yeah that just is what it is I guess but um yeah I wasn't going to play him like Smith row had like was it IP switch or something um and then Rogers had a good fixture as well and against Leicester so I was just like why would I play Pedro really but you know is what it is um yeah 74 R 1.3 million um I've never really been this low at the start of the season so before so um Uncharted ter for me and hopefully I can just start to yeah get back up there because you had a good game game week one I think it's there probably like a little bit of lb from people using triple captain in game week one and I always think like the ranks always bench Beast as well yeah yeah I always think ranks are a little bit bloated at the start of the season because some players will yeah play like newer players or not newer players but people who aren't taking it seriously will wild card and yeah you're right bench boost I mean in my for instance my work mini league who is full of people or some people that don't take it as seriously as perhaps we might like chips have been thrown down Gams one two and three with triple captains and bench boost so I'm putting some of it down to that as well so let's roll with roll with that um all right um what what happened to me I had another Harland hatrick which was lovely but then Salah just he bit back again which I was bit disappointed about I didn't did I make any moves I don't think I did I think I rolled the transfer um I contemplate didn't I getting rid of Bruno for buo which would have been really nice didn't go for it in the end and you know that's quite a lot of Mis points but the transfers will come in handy this week I think I got 77 Holland Captain c e got 10 um that was about it really didn't have any clean sheets but Robinson got an assist and esack obviously got some points it was pretty bare really yeah those two are the big difference I think yeah as and Robinson yeah yeah absolutely so yeah it was um a close game weekend I had a green aror but it's nothing nothing too exciting 2.2 million let's see where we are after like game week 10 or 12 when we're like a third of the way through the season and um yeah for in the millions then we can start panicking yeah exactly right let's let's talk a little bit about this upcoming game week there's been a load of talk I think about wild card being played I nearly did it you've been talking about it a lot are you still nearly done it a few times as well I'm still undecided to be honest but yeah I just think it seems really early I think like you're right in previous Seasons we would have thought about wild carding in the first International break because it's only three game weeks this season that that almost feels too early as as well uh to be honest there been huge market movement like if I look at the front page of the Premier League uh FPL site Pedro Diaz Harland Salah all like the top transfers in obviously Anana is in there as well from Villa and then people are like transferring out you know some good players esack gone Watkins sacka gardial Palmer I think it's three weeks is Palmer like what I know I know he's been training I know it's crazy but I I think that yeah to make it a wild card at the moment the reason I've probably gone and not done it is because I haven't found a wild card draft that I feel comfortable with I feel like I still don't know enough about each of the players and yeah the same I think I've um yeah I've tried to put things together and I've just not I've been like maybe like 0.5 short of like a good team that I like and it's just like so at that point I would have to do a significant downgrade to someone basically where I'm just not really not wanting to do that but at the same time um hopefully in a few weeks like cheaper assets will come forward because like I'm going to start being priced out of the players that on on this sort of wild card I won't be able to get them because I'll be rising up in prices and things so you know um I gotta hope Watkins comes back this week and stuff like that and yeah hopefully I can see him training soon because he's a worry because if he's out then I'm gonna have to Wild Card for sure because that's another player and J who knows what's happening with him uh just because um Darwin's not gone on International break he's been training two weeks of slot yeah um so there's that worry as well he might play and then obviously all the um yeah do I want Arsenal players anymore considering all the the um the other issues so yeah what do you I mean this is a bit more of a a wider point you were you were quite like firm at the start of the season and still now that you didn't really think harem was was good value and I think a lot of wild cards been played to double up on what just get both harand and Salah do you still think even if you had the war card to play now and when you play in the future do you still think you're more minded to have one rather than the other uh yeah I think I would probably still not have harand when I've been looking at drafts I've not been including Harland um yeah I think that's that's probably like reflective good pricing there's probably times to season where we want both but yeah I feel the same when when I'm looking at the the teams I can do and I see drafts on on Twitter I think a team with both of them in just seems like so bloated for two assets and the rest of the team around it at the moment are filled with like picks we don't know are going to be any good even even so even with only just Salah I'm still looking at a drafts where it's like I've got two five million midfielders in there it's just like yeah it's just just because I'm trying to spend I've been looking at son I've been looking at Watkins Watkins um Pedro and isak still like I I want to keep e still I still want to keep walk so it was expensive forward line as well so um but yeah son Sun would probably have to go in that scenario unfortunately but yeah I like sun we'll talk about him later but yeah well should we talk about some matches from this weekend and get excited about that and then perhaps wrap up at the end by talking about like picks we like for the for wild card yep do you want to do you want to kick off with the Tottenham and Arsenal game yeah sure so yeah so obviously North L and derby um I think it's the last game of the week on the Sunday night isn't it yeah it might be yeah let's a look uh 2 o' fine um yeah last six results um in the Premier League um Spurs have had four losses one win one draw uh they scored nine goals um Arsenal one loss four wins one draw obviously yeah the opposite 13 goals scored um form wise over the first three fixtures uh Spurs yeah surprisingly XG 4.88 which is uh which they scored six goals which is seventh overall for teams and then an XGC of 3.6 the three conceeded which is sixth best but that's actually better than Arsenal's XGC and better than the Arsenal's XG which is 4.48 and Arsenal's XGC is 3.7 so um yeah like Spurs are beating Arsenal in the sort of attacking and defensive metrics in the data yeah um obviously by the amount conceded um you know Arsenal conceded what is it like one and Spurs was conceded three but still like number wise analytic wise Spurs are in better form to be honest so interesting um yeah so um rice is obviously banned for this one um which is a bit of concern um I think it's an offensive concern as well with his quality pieces his link up play as well um and yeah not being available in those sort of phases of um attacking seems to be is going to be an issue I think um but at the same time they could probably play havit back there they can push him back um into sort of a pivot with parte and maybe I guess georgino possibly yeah um so I don't think like the quality is that much of a drop off obviously odard is also a bit of an issue as well um he's like unofficially been sort of um saying he's going to be out for about three weeks yeah I heard that too um yeah yeah so maybe not the end of the world but possibly the end of the world in terms of maybe even this early in terms of the title race if they lose to Spurs and City and the next two they're going to be quite a bit behind already so yeah I think it's a really bad time for them to lose you're right like three weeks now there's like two such important away fixtures which probably two of their the most difficult are going to be this season because Spurs are always up for the north London Derby and yeah City are going to want to put one over on them start of the season of course um so yeah just um sack's record versus SPS in the last six um in the Premier League so he's scored three goals and two assists there obviously pretty good um and then Sun's record versus Arsenal in the last six is five goals so that's pretty good too um yeah both main attackers from each team have good history and form in this fixture um so I would say most likely outcome is both teams to score so I think in my position I've got a CA and parro in my team I'll be looking to start only one of them and it's really not clear which one is going to be the best to be honest because Spurs are at home the data would say spur porro is better because he's he's quite attacking as well but then at the same time like Spurs definitely going to concede and is he going to do anything attacking wise like who knows because their defense isn't massively changed like they're still front their back four is still the same Ry is still there like I George yo is going to protect as hopefully with party as well like both of them will do the job re rice does so I don't think it's G be too bad defensively so at the moment I'm leaning towards cber starting but at the same time like I don't feel comfortable about it so um and porro is maybe more fun yeah um yeah I don't know like it's it's hard it's it's really hard like I 5050 Choice maybe back the home team but Arsenal U the elite defense I suppose I mean not this season so far but um yeah they have only conceded one and they kept two clean sheets out of three so um but yeah I think all attackers are worth playing here like hav sun sacka they all seem like good picks if slank's back could do fine but you know he's probably a worse pick than Someone Like Son think in this because I think he's probably going to get marked out the game by sber or Gabrielle so um yeah and I mean obviously the the big thing is probably hav people were looking at him on wild card and stuff like that and I've I've been saying he's like such a good asset which I still think he is but like if he's going to start to play in the Midfield three um over the next two that's obviously going to Dent his appeal a bit um I think it's it's a good thing he's going to play like or you know from our selfish FPL point of you cuz I don't think many people will be investing in Arsenal assets like now game we four and gameweek five but Wild Card 6 which looks like a prime window in Arsenal got three good fixtures then like if he is sort of if OD guard's back in and havit is back up front by then it you know there's no fa missing out of his points and hopefully he remains still a bit of a sleeper pick because yeah I bit on him later but his like points per million value at the moment is is far better than sacka and he's nearly matched him for points so far this season and yeah I think he's you know there's a there's a case for having havs only from game week six onwards to free up money in your midfields you don't necessarily need sacka but yeah inter yeah I agree with you about Arsenal this weekend I think we're taking two of their main three midfielders let's say out of the side is gonna have you know it's gonna have a big impact there's no question about that and the back aren't as good yeah I I was watching a bit of um planet fbl um and they they got um a guy called Clayton on there and he's an arsenal fan and he's just he was just saying that like he doesn't think it's going to be that much of an issue I think they're they're good enough their team and the squad is good enough to like beat a sort of ter a bad spur well they're not bad spur side but I still think they're like good enough quality to still beat them yeah um and I think the players coming in is is more of a system rather than straight like for like sort of players and and and those those players can come in and do a job like georgino I think it was last year when he started playing games like he was really good like he was he was not a weak Link at all so um yeah we we'll see I guess but um yeah I think the attackers could I still think saaka like obviously odard is the one that's usually linking up with him but I he he'll probably get more space on that side now because he's he's gonna have less um sort of people occupying his Zone I guess and S Saka do well in this fixture last season remember he had like a goalen assist perhaps and I think hit's had the same so I think you're right it's going to be an open game and I'm think it you know not wouldn't be surprised if Sak have us both return again this this game week and and return well I I still like it from s like a lot of people are looking at sacka to Salah and stuff like that to get Salah in people have just just Harland and and I obviously see that but I could see sacka getting something in this for sure absolutely all right should we move on a chat a little bit about Liverpool and and Forest it' be good to hear your thoughts I no it's Jammer in the the chat um sorry about the timing mentioned um that he was looking to move move away from Liverpool Assets in in gameweek six and you know I think it's it's interesting I just they've got such good fixures over the the next two and they've shown such great promise in the start of the Season it seems um yeah surprising to to hear that yeah Wolves Away Crystal Palace away and then Chelsea home after six like those two are definitely still good like I think I watched a bit of Raptor's video as well saying that like if you wild card in seven or eight you can keep those Liverpool players those two fixtures longer those good two away fixtures um whereas the other people are probably moving off them and you've got a Salah against wolves and and Palace who look really bad defensively so yeah well I think just speaking about yeah this game specifically in terms of projected goals and clean sheet odds Liverpool coming 2.8 um expected goals this this game week 46% chance of the clean sheet that's only very slightly behind City this this game week forest with a expected goal rate of 0.7 6% clean sheet rate so you know the odds are are favoring a a big Liverpool win here and now like I'm not surprised Salah had you know he's played some minutes over the International International break but I think he's going to be you know obviously fine coming back into the into the team and you know interesting topic that we talk about every week is how well he's he's going to keep Pace with harand or how well harland's going to keep Pace with with Salah this season and that's going to be like the I think the main Crux of our like talking point all season long five big chances so far this season that's that's second overall he's had um he's had four big chances created which is first so I think the difference between harand and uh harand and Salah so far this season is salah's creativity harand hasn't really got that so if his if his goals drop off salah's getting the sort of the points from creative Outlets as as well and I I think in in this game he's got another good chance to yeah to score well and I'd be interested to see considering their similar matchups who people who if people own both Salah and Harland who they're most likely going to Captain and perhaps people in the comments or in the chat who have got both can can tell us um yeah 14 10 and 17 in the last three so I imagine for you he's going to be nailed on Captain this week um yeah I think so um there's yeah Watkins with a good picture um obviously walk's bit of an issue but I think um Isaac could be a good fixture too um and then yeah I think that's probably maybe even Pedro I mean obviously that seems stupid but um just because it's like price point but that it's home fixture that's that's GC is good it's good I want to get get your thoughts on Diaz right because he's he's predicted to maybe rise in price like2 over this International break I was like really considering on that Sunday Sunday night but it was like that postmatch thing of like oh man I want that player that's that's done well but it's a small sample size so far this season in three games which is you know again one of the reasons why I hav't played the the wild card and what we're seeing in these first three game weeks I don't know if it's like a Purple Patch rather or Purple Patch rather than like it's it's a indication of what his season long form is so I had to look at what is I appreciate it's under different managers but he's providing an attack and return this season every 56 minutes last season it was every 175 5 minutes so that comes down to two things has he got that much better over the summer or is he playing in a side that suits him better and gives him more license to to do things and then if you look even more at his numbers so 0.76 XG per 90 so far this season against 0.41 uh XG per9 last season so he's roughly nearly doubled his expected goal output so far this season and I think that's why it's so difficult to make like cut and dry decisions on on these type of players who are I don't know who haven't been like big FPL heroes in the in the past I think he's he's really popular now but I'm not sure if it's yeah if it's going to last what where do you sit on or where do you come on down on that uh yeah I think um you're probably right in like he probably has got better the system probably does suit him a bit more um but at the same time like that is probably a little bit unsustainable um I think he he's just been fortunate to get on the the back of some of the things and um you know the ball for the his second against United I think just like happened to land in the spot where he just rifled at home first time like maybe that's good for him where he was just being in that position but at the same time like he's like I don't know a yard the other way or something he doesn't he doesn't get that chance so um yeah like he's a good pick like obviously is but like he's coming back GL from South America just as someone like Pedro like nobody thinks that that's really going to be an issue but um you know G's been playing in in Europe and Darwin's not played at all like gapco probably deserves some time like the but you know slot hasn't rotated anyone so far I think apart from quansa um so is he just yeah so is he just gonna keep playing his first first um maybe 11 until he he doesn't need to I guess like and it's the start of the champions league isn't it so we've got com back from International break into like another three games in a week spell so I'm sure there will be rotation like he's already not played Diaz for full 90s in two of the opening three games I mean what you're obviously paying a lot more for Salah but you're getting those 90s I sort of coming around to the main question like for people who don't have a Salah team and for people who are maybe going to Wild Card Salah out in a few game weeks is Diaz like a good enough cover but I think probably the answer to that is going to come with more more data more knowledge of how he how he plays in this system like we've got three games to to judge and one of those he's he's blanked in and anyway I just think it's interesting because he's near up to nearly 17% now up to near preseason and kungu levels of ownership and yeah it's just it's just interesting he player I looked at but I'm just not not quite so sure on him I think um I think he'll probably do the thing where like his front three he plays his first 11 and then he just takes off d as jotter probably around the sort of 60 Mark and then J off salar off maybe around the 80 I could see that happening and then those three maybe Trent again as well like the the ones that he really needs to be fit constantly um just take them off a bit earlier see that happening I mean I've been so lucky with Trent I mean I'm just going to mention him briefly but like it's criminal that I overlooked him you know I went off last season's forming that Liverpool were not great defensively last season they had eight clean sheets All Season didn't think they were going to make much of a difference they've got like three already so nearly half of that total after three game weeks and Trent has been so unlucky not to return big as well like that disallowed goal against United should have had a an assist for yter in the brenford game I think it was and in the I switch game so yeah I'm he's like on my definite bring in list this game week and yeah I can't sit through another pool game like knowing that I could be on the end of a a beating basically but yeah he's been a beast and he was really good for England got the assist last night for Kane um yeah I just think he looks good sh and then just quickly on Forest defensively before we move on they're actually you know I was quite surprised so the projected goals and clean sheet odds obviously heavily in liveable favor but they have been you know decent defensively so far the season they've not played the same caliber of opponent but they're third best for expected goals conceded after after three games um Liverpool on 2.1 expected goals and seated Forest 2.5 I think it's City is the other team in that mix they've conceded five big chances which is the same as Liverpool and you know like I said they've had good fixtures we knew that but they've they've still performed and done well so I think it will be a I think it will be a tighter game than the Man United game and maybe the most defensive team Liverpool have played so far I think that um I think that minkovich has made a difference he he he is a solid and good Defender I I feel like they num would certainly start to drop off with them with um playing better teams obviously I think Liverpool should get like a two-nil win that seems seems fine to me will Forest score do you see that I don't think so I don't I think that they've only they've had like the really good fixtures at the start of this season and they've only they only scored two in or is it three in three games I think wood scored two and more Gibs white scored the other one maybe so they've had like good fixtures and yeah they've not like scored multiple so I think they'd be surprised if they even scored one I'm just checking it was one one I think it was 111 one nil and one1 wasn't it yeah so yeah they they've not blown teams away yeah and a lot of people are looking at um double defense for Liverpool and wild card which I I understand from the three games but yeah at the same time they've faced not very good oppos opposition as well so obviously man united You' probably wouldn't expect a clean sheet but you know they're still capable so um are they going to be like back to being good like defensively he remains to be seen but I I think a double up feels a little bit Rich yeah so also Robertson is pretty attacking so I think Robertson has look like again he's looked really good and he's on some set pieces he's slightly less expensive than um Trent but like I he's like a million cheaper but I don't know if I'd have Robertson over Trent I'd only have it as like a double and then and then you're right I don't know if I trust a double enough um but yeah Allison in goal is actually scored more points so far this season than Trent but despite that I still don't think I'd double up with a Defender and a a goalkeeper from Liverpool yeah Fair um okay so for versus Chelsea next one I've decided to look at um yeah so Chelsea form wise um zero clean sheets so far five conceded um an XGC of 3.2 who which is actually weirdly fourth best which I I didn't see coming um so their defense is looking pretty good I guess like considering they play Man City as well um yeah 37 shots for them which is mid-table of all teams um 11 big chances which is third of all teams and next year of 5.08 which is Sixth and then seven goals scored um but you know they scored six of them in that one game yeah um so um maybe slightly inflated there as well um yeah Bournemouth wise um their XG of 5.9 n which is third of all teams which is great for bourma um yeah 10 big chances sixth overall five goal scored XGC of 4.7 is 13th worst um zero clean sheets and they've conceded four um so yeah defense is not looking good probably looks good for Palmer returns Jackson returns things like that um yes seeno he seems to be the sort of um hot pick at the moment um 5.6 million he's already RIS once only 5% owned when I made these notes it's probably gone up um since then um yeah not blanked yet eight five and six for a player from Bournemouth pretty good 19 points in three games um so he's obviously he's excellent considering his team I guess yeah um but perhaps inflated by their fical difficulty um of the first three of not in for away Newcastle at home which obviously Newcastle away seemed to be worse and then Everton away like those fixtures not too bad so yeah maybe that's been inflated um but then the fixtures from now on are pretty mixed so people are starting to bring them in but their fixtures are are you know rough so Chelsea at home this week um you know that could be a competitive game he still could still get returns Liverpool way after that Southampton home Obviously good Leicester away is good Obviously good um Arsenal at home yeah tough ason away and then Man City home after that so that's a really tough run that eight to 10 yeah he I mean he is 5.6 million you can bench him you could probably sell him for someone back to like a Smith r or something like that um so like yeah his his price and his value seems to be good like those fixtures after Chelsea and Liverpool those two in the middle there are great so you know I think he's probably a fine pickup but um yeah so 17 shots puts in first for all players although that didn't include um Harland in the stats for some reason it just harand just wasn't showing up um don't know why ask ask FF Hub why that was happening but he's there now but you think he's second to him so okay fair enough um yeah so he's had two big chances XG of 1.19 key passes of four big chances created of two and XA of 1.3 so I don't think his numbers look that amazing he's only had one bonus despite returning in all three games I was surprised about that as well I thought he would have HED some bonus as well yeah absolutely same um so I don't think um his returns are sustainable basically is what I'm trying to say um but then again that at 5.5 million who's not risen yet tavanir he's played pretty much the same minutes he's only played six few minutes he's at 0.3% owned his XG is actually beating SOS with 2.1 versus 1.2 and their expected points taverners is actually higher um on 20 versus 17 so um you know he's had one goal versus Sanu two goals and one assist but at the same time like you know there's a player who's got more XG maybe maybe that's just saying that like seenu has been a little bit fortunate to get these whereas others haven't got them I guess and he's still at 5.5 you don't you can say that 0.1 as well he might be might be good for that yeah I mean and he's playing he's fit he's he's usually a talent man for that b up team so his expected points rate is higher than S after the thir game weeks as well so exactly that's which which does surprise me actually considering considering the returns so yeah um I'm not saying pick him or anything it's just a matchup Focus wise like tavanir could be someone uh does well in this one as well yeah I like it I like it I kind of fancy B up to win this game to be honest like their expected goals you're right probably slightly higher because Chelsea have played City but you know they're still they're still decent I mean Chelsea padded those numbers by scoring six against wolves so no I think this is going to be quite an open game and I wouldn't be surprised to see simenia continue his run and what I quite like about Bournemouth now even though they like clawed it back late against ever so you can't really say that was like a good performance I think they're still trying to like work out how their team is uh plays without sanky and it seems like they've got lots of inexpensive players who were sort of chipping into to make the goals happen so maybe that's not great from an FPL point of view because it's a bit of a spread but it does mean there are some you know some a lot of options potentially I think that Evan Nelson like I said is is a quality player as well once he just settles down um and starts to you know start hitting some goals he might be on penalties as well because he they'll probably want to give it to him to start game scoring goals so um yeah he he'll he's six million he's going to be a good route when they have a good run of fixtures um yeah it's because you know the sort of Striker picks are limited aren't they and and he's going to be a decent option yeah I I'll talk about Palmer eventually when we talk about wild card pick that's why I've not mentioned him yet cool I mean from 11 to n to 20 I was just having a look on the ticker they Bic got like a green or gray fixture run according to fpl the only like Gray marked games they've got Spurs at home which they can score in man united away which they absolutely can score in and full them away so yeah they a really good run of games from game week 11 so yeah I like the look of them right let's oh sorry they're cheap as well so it's going to be easy to get on to them yeah exactly yeah um let's just quickly talk about um city and brenford then um so projected goals and clean sheet ODS like I mentioned against uh for po I wanted to just compare the two of them um Man City slightly higher predicted goals this game week 2 .9 to Liverpool or 2.95 to Liverpool's 2.8 exactly strange because Liverpool's next year is higher than City's I yeah thought the same too and I think it's just based on last season odds as well but 46% chance for clean sheet is the same as Liverpool Forest have a sorry brenford again almost the same in terms of um projected goals .76 and a 5% clean sheet also I don't know why the returns don't quite marry up but yeah so there bookies are expecting Man City to score slightly Higher Goals but you know negligible har brenford considering that their against City recently I think they've been quite good against city as well and like yeah last season in um I think it was the double game week when we all triple Captain Harland they played brenford at home and Harland just got a single goal in that game and he struggled again in the way game against brenford I think that was one of the first games after he came back from injury when foden got a hattrick but um yeah he hasn't been he hasn't been great against brenford in previous seasons and the season before that they beat them at they had here so yeah but he's been in great form this season 2.3 I love that this season yeah exactly yeah 2.3 big chances per average um per game this season 1.2 XG average per game so I think the main question is how much can he keep this up or what can he keep up so far the season because his price has gone up now so 15.2 for him for anyone that's getting on is you know it's quite a big J didn't take much to go up in price and his ownership just too bad by hacks yeah yeah true 67% ownership now I think he was like 50 when the season started so we've had a lot of converts I just looking at I think the main reason you're going to have to own harand is because you want to cap in every every week I don't think you can really own him and not think about captaining him every week so I was having a look at the the fixes you got coming up so brenford Arsenal um and Newcastle and next three games I I kind of think you can cap him him in the brenford game and you can probably now captain in the Arsenal game without rice and potentially odard there I think that makes it more of like a must-win game for for City and the Newcastle game they haven't been like great defensively so I think you know fine but if you're looking for Alternatives in the Arsenal game Salah obviously got a plum fixture that game week Sun's got a good game during that um game week and then 7 to 12 I was looking at these fixtures thinking there's no reason I wouldn't want to Captain him in all of these games Fulham at home Wolves Away southampt at home is obviously the next juicy one for people talking about triple Captain Bournemouth away Brighton away is maybe the the most tricky one and then Tottenham at home so I think it's at the moment like for me I like it's difficult because I like the Salah drafts more at the moment but I think the fomo of not having Haren Captain is almost is too great and that but yeah and and I also don't like the double up like I say because of of the the weaker team so it and I think as soon as one of them has like a blank this season there's going to be so much transfer activity of been like oh my God Sal's blanked we've got to take him out and get Harland or oh my God harland's not worth 15.2 and that will absolutely happen there'll be so many transfers either way won't there yeah I feel like it's G one of them is gon to blank this week I feel like it's the week that one of them is it's more likely to be Sal do you think oh I was going to sayland but I think that's that's what's great so far about this season because you can either try try both in in a team and like have cheaper players around it which Jammer in the chat earlier said he's done with with good success because he's doing better than both of us at the moment but I I don't know I don't like living with the the fomo anyway it's it's really interesting he's obviously playing out of his skin so far this season and seven goals in in three games just apparently he put up an absolute State like one of the worst performan he's ever had apparently in the Norway first game finished nil nil and it's just like odard and Har in that game it's nil nil against Kazakhstan it's like I saw some report put up just like some absolute just slog Fest at Holland the worst game he's ever seen him play and he was just utterly awful so that's kind of funny but yeah yeah yeah he he can have like the very odd bad game like that game against Arsenal last season at home was poor and that's probably one of the reasons why I want to bring in s in the next two two game weeks just to cover that Arsenal game where I'm not sure don't even think it's that odd that he has bag like got often often games where he just disappears and he just doesn't make any but like what's been the difference so far this season is like he's still not getting the touches but he's just getting the one touch to to finish some of his finishes were just crazy that second goal against West Ham he just like touched it and then oh beled it in and even the third one thinking like is he how would the defense G him so much time as well he just had so much time to just take a touch and just launch it yeah but even as it finishes against Z Swit apart from obviously the penalty were were pretty good as as well so I thought kilman would do a number on him you know but no it didn't happen it it's down to Nathan Collins this week come on Collins lad oh no no I'm loving it at the moment I think it's I think it's it's great that we've got like the diverse Captain picks but I feel like as soon as yeah one of them blanks is going to be Mass hysteria and panic I'm all for that I'm scared um what El I got to say about this one yeah just I think that's was pretty much it really on um the only other player on city is worth talking about is is Lewis like he's gone up to to 4.7 now um 14 points in his first three games a six a two and a a six that's just you know despite the fact they've lost two clean sheets he's got an attacking return he hit the cross bar in that I switch game per personally he's kind of like not for me because he falls into that category of Man City Defender which has notoriously been apart from probably Canelo and gardial at the end of last season is always a bit of a rotation risk but he's played three 90 minutes so far this season and maybe he's taking that spot from walker and a is now injured so yeah I was gonna say like AK is now injured so like people seem to think that's going to help vardal which sure it will but like at the same time we saw Lewis play left back for England last night yeah so like he can play left back as well I just think it makes his ex mens go up as well if not more so yeah Walker could play and then Lewis could play on the left like give guardio a game off like yeah that could happen but at the same time like Lewis you know he's playing all the games so maybe he needs a game off you know so um I think if you're on wild card and you can afford like he is just 4.7 million and you can rotate him or whatever and you can or if you play him you can afford for who ever comes on to do you know is a decent sort of sub or whatever then he probably is a really good pick yeah well I'm the same time I think he probably will get minutes off the bench every if he does age yeah so there's there's that it will be frustrating I'm just having a look at that they actually haven't got that many defenders in in FPL they've only got seven one of them Z who's you know probably injured now for some length of time it sounded like it was quite bad stones and Walker have barely played probably because he's a bit like foden he's bringing back up to speed slowly because they all last night though so did he play 490 uh I think so I don't know but um yeah so I assume he's fit now yeah well anyway it' just be interesting to see how again I wouldn't want to take a punt on him this early because I'm so conservative but and also I don't think I don't think City are that reliable for for clean or as reliable for clean shits even though he's only 4.7 so I don't know what what do you think he's he's probably not for me he's not my kind of player but I think if he's if he's still starting every game by the time I wild card then I'll I'll be looking at him yeah I think but now if I was going to do it now um I would probably want that one Maverick pick and and he probably would be it yeah Harry in the chat said pet rette is about to come into Force anytime now UCL starting for picking and I kind of agree especially when it comes to the their defense in three games next week and the fact that the Arsenal game is at the end of like the Champions League week makes you think there will be some um rotation maybe the rotation will be in UCL but yeah definitely something to keep an eye on I think um if anyone is looking to sell sacker as well um if you're not going to Salah Salah or whatever like de bruyne for the bford game seems he's played all three 90s he started all three of them um I think that's interesting he could easily get benched before champions league as well though but um yeah de Bry fun yeah he's he's super low owned as well what is he 11% that's not bad is it yeah 9.6 million and then we've obviously got foden to come back in sometime yeah who knows when that's goingon to be though like no idea he played 45 minutes against Chelsea and then he disappeared again so yeah maybe maybe time for the the first I just had a look at the minutes yeah he played 45 minutes against Chelsea and then he's not played since I don't even remember that never do I okay fair enough yeah G's played more minutes than so yeah I think it's still too early to make some decisions on City mids um um sh we talk about some wild card picks briefly yep and talk about okay so um yeah the guy who I didn't mention the Chelsea Bournemouth one was obviously Palmer um yeah 10.6 million now 41% owned like most the Twitter sphere has not owned in most of the season but yeah 41% is crazy um yeah Bournemouth um away next West Ham away after that Brighton at home not Forest at home those two in a row seemed really good Liverpool away and then Newcastle at home so yeah those two after that not so good but yeah 276 from three games so far five returns from an xgi of of 1.9 Bruno has had um zero returns from an xgi of two 2.0 so um yeah there's there's FPL for you in a nut show I guess um kind of ridiculous really um so the fixtures to me like like look ins s enticing on paper but I'm less I'm less sure I guess um Bournemouth have looked like pretty competitive So Far West Ham have a good team but obviously like you know they did can see quite a few toand um and then Brighton and Forest no walk no walkovers anymore that's for sure so that those two games should be competitive just because Chelsea are know near as good as they have been so um I I would definitely include on one card for sure like he is a top pick absolutely but I do think the runner is the run is like sort of tougher than it on paper like he um so I had to look at sort of his appearances obviously for like in the Premier League and for Chelsea and stuff against these teams so two appearances versus Bournemouth like he's had one assist two appearances versus West Ham he's had one goal four appearances versus Brighton so I guess this is probably uh while being part of City team but yeah one goal against them and then three appearances versus forest and one assist so he has he has had returns against all the next four but they're not you know he's not hauling he's not having massive returns like but the same like 10.6 million for like a goal like every game or a return a game but that seems fine um well not majorly fine but still passable um yeah what what do you think about him I I would absolutely own him on my God yeah I think it I think if I was wild carding this this week and a lot of people wild carded last week to get him in if I was wild carding him this week I would probably have him as well yet over over sacka and then obviously I think a play would probably not to go with harand because I don't think you can probably have like harand um Salah and Palmer and a and a decent Squad around that but you know I think obviously he's been blown up by that huge game against wolves like seven the 17 point pointer there but you know he shown last season he's capable of that I think he's I think he's absolutely solo pick and I think what's quite nice about this start of this season is the way they actually the midfielders have sort of like returned in line with that like Salah is the most expensive and he's led the way slightly after that Palmer is slightly outscored sacka and then around just underneath sacka you've got Sun so I think the the pricing is sort of aligned to how they've scored so far and that's what I said what I said last when we talked about surprises and stuff like I haven't been surprised by these players so yeah I know so yeah no I I think I like Palmer obviously I also like sack at the moment what we're find is we can't have more but yeah if I was going to Wild Card this week I would probably have Palmer over sacka and yeah back him to do well he seems to be playing that number 10 10 roll well he could have returned more against Palace it looked like quite an open game so yeah there were times in the highlights where he was like he and the Chelsea players were just like running at three people in palace defense and Henderson somehow bailed them out so and obviously he's he's more expensive than the second so it's easy to get back as well absolutely absolutely um yeah sure okay uh well and he's probably not that much of a surprise but his ownership is only eight% and that's in buo so I don't think even if you're on wild card now it's like it's necessarily a bad time to to get him in so I think he's proven his worth already as the fifth highest scoring mid and it's so annoying because we knew he was going to be good he started last season well had such a great season until he got you know injured and that derailed him a little bit but he's he's proven himself as a good FPL player he you know monopolizes set pieces he's a good finisher and you know he's got 24 points after three games so far the season I think if you're on a wild card now it's like not a bad time to preamp getting him for his good run I think only this city game is is tricky and then Spurs away I think we talked about it the other week I would fancy him to get G to get a return against Spurs away and then after that his and brentford's run is is really nice we talked about before game week six to 12 it's basically all greens and and Grays on the fixture ticker so yeah I think he's as important to his Club as as is to his monopolized set pieces he obviously gets that extra point those are all things we already know so yeah I'm surprised are you surprised he's still only 8% well I think for people wild carding now is um they they might look at the next two and be like I can probably not go there but even for for me or you that possibly aren't wild carding now like we could look at the next two and be like yeah probably back against that look at him from six seven on I I just feel like game week five is like the sneaky pick for him I feel like could he could do really well in that game and yeah wait an extra week why not get on him early but yeah NE the J um J to him in game five work yeah nice okay you got any anyone to talk about uh yeah so Robinson and we did mention him a little bit earlier um yeah three sixes so far no bonus um but yeah only 6.5% owned I think Li we said I think you would own him with Trent if you're going to do it but yeah he absolutely is the ey test at the moment um so I've got a little sort of um American football sort of analogy like Trent feels like he's sort of like the quarterback whereas Robinson feels like he's like a wide receiver kind of like getting high and wide and sort of providing like like really good goal threat as from a defensive angle so um yeah he passes the ey test he doesn't necessarily pass the sort of um stats test where you know he's got five key passes which is third obviously that doesn't necessarily lead to any sort of goals or or assists and stuff but yeah .3 XG which is 11 football Defenders Two Shots which is not that High um but you know he's had threatening shots at least XA of 0.39 big chance he created is zero and one big chance himself so he looks like he's probably G to be getting more attacking goals possibly than assists um so like I said his stats don't jump off the page I guess it's more of a grass pick than analytical pick yeah um yeah 2.2 XGC for poool is obviously the best defensive numbers in in the Premier League so far with zero goals conceded um if we assume their sort of defense is still going to be good and they can keep clean sheets um the floor for Robertson can now be a clean sheet and he's got much like sort of attacking potential a much higher upside than he he did before because obviously he was always looking at like you know a base of two Liverpool were conceding all the time and obviously Trent had more a threat whereas now got possibly a base of six which he's he's proved so far in his his three matches and um you know he's he's just like Trent has been unlucky to not get attacking returns so um yeah I I think if you're picking on one card like those two at the back for the next next three or four at least seem seem great to me um it's just yeah I think you absolutely pick Trent and Robinson is just someone you could just pick on the side as just a low upside pick yeah yeah no I like the robin pick as well I think if to go with Salah you know he's he's going to be nailed on and like we said earlier I think he's he's got the capability of getting a return because he's on some corners and set pieces as well so I think a lot of it relies on Liverpool's defense being good so will remains to be you see yeah so say same with um Trent as well they've both been sort of been taken off bit early which is it can be good for Defenders as well so they've got um that possibility too um on other wild card pick so again maybe I've done a couple more I think minty is someone who are impressed Us in preseason and has been like okay so far this season without being like great he's been outperformed by Mata matoma but appreciate he's probably not he's not as expensive as that and AD Ringer's done well but you know he's got two returns in in three games a 42 and a a four he was the one that had the big chance against Arsenal that um Rey saved and Pedro followed in on to got the assist in that way and in the Everton game he obviously came off at half time when he got his concussion so there's you know who can say what he would have done in the second half but he would have at least got two more points from that so he's an interesting pick he's he's certainly not as popular as Pedro Welbeck but I think he's pretty well priced mid if you switching to a 352 he looks more attacking than someone like Smith R who I've had and for all mids under 5.7 he's actually you know fairing not too badly so he's he's not great on XG so far he's at 0.2 XG per 90 so that's eigh of all mids under 5.7 so that's not great but he tops the expected assists um per 90 so he's got an expected assist rate of 0.8 per 90 so that's the first of all mids under 5.7 so yeah collect like collectively he's he's probably one of he's one of the better assets in that 5.5 million bracket and yeah his his fixtures a mixed like we said the next two are good for for um Brighton so I think if you were looking to yeah for some short termism against Switch and Forest that looks like a good route and even that Chelsea game and the Spurs game afterwards not not too bad but it's not like plain sailing green greens and Grays in the tracker uh it's a little bit mixed yeah he's probably worth um targeting for the next two but he's he's GNA get taken off early most games and we have seen that he has been like ainger is too good to just stay on the bench for 90s so um yeah but he's he's great as well so but yeah he's but he'd been a long long way away like Africa for his Internationals and so see how he comes back as guess yeah I L looked it up actually he finished his um he finished his International break like on on Monday he played his last game so I think he might be back or yeah back already so yeah I think he's he's definitely an interesting he's probably not like the best option from from Brighton but he's because a dring is there but yeah he he showed like he could be a good option this year yep okay um so another one I wanted to mention is son uh he's obviously 10 million 99.1% owned so he's he's a good differential at the moment um obviously this Arsenal fixture looks tough on paper but at the same time like we've mentioned rice and odard being out like this is probably the time if you're gonna go there on wild card and stuff like I think he's a great pick and then I think the fixtures for him like attacking wise I think that that they suit his player style of fast sort of countering attack countering against team teams that should attack them at the same time so like brenford man united Brighton West Ham Palace Villa those all seem like games that are suited for him to get goals on the on the on the Counterattack yeah so yeah I I think he's been absolutely overlooked on wild cards because obviously he is expensive and people are looking at palmer but like those fixtures to me I can absolutely see him possibly outscoring Palmer over that lot um yeah brenford yeah they all sound good honestly like um so he's got a good record as I've mentioned as well in North L Derby so I don't think this week is that big of a reason to not pick him as well so um yeah we also kind of like it's a shame that Dom's been injured we don't really know if he's gonna come straight back in and what that sort of situation is gonna look look like but I don't think that should really put us off him as much either because like you know like Palmer he's got sort of big big [ __ ] in him so um yeah tottenham's XG of 4.8 eight which is seventh as I said like 1.27 um XG from himself which is eighth of all mids um two big chances five key passes two big chances created so he's looking like he's good on both sides of the ball of assists and attacking potential so assumingly he'll be on penalties we don't know for sure but um yeah as of right now I guess he probably is um so I think he's a great pick yeah I like sun and I have like already early season regret because as you know one of my well I had done in a lot of my drafts in preseason then in like the last week I sort of got turned onto this salanki and Bruno idea rather than sun and Pedro and that's like set me back some some points but yeah he's he's he's been good and I'm sure he'll continue to be good but like yeah we talked about a bit earlier as well he is obviously going to be some impact with salanki coming back maybe that makes salanki a good pick for Less a bit like havit and Sack at the minute so yeah it could but at the same time we don't know if slank is actually back yeah true so so far we don't we we yeah and just probably is usually quite good on telling actually telling us when he's gonna be back so we'll see and just mentioned have thing quickly so he's another one to mention for for wild carding again like we mentioned I don't think this North L Derby game is one to be worried about because I expect it's going to be quite open but he's offering a better points per million than sacka so far this season it's a small sample size but it's not much to separate the two of them um considering as a 1.9 million gap so he's actually outperformed sacka for XG so far 1.5 to uh 1. three this is per game I should say expected assists he's he's nowhere near though expected assist of just 0.1 per game to sackers 0.6 but his expected points is is similar 14.8 to 16 so it's relatively close and in game week six when the Arsenal's fix just turn and they played two of the promoted sides back toback at home in Leicester and Southampton and then Bournemouth I think he'll pretty much guarantee but being my team and then you know three game weeks proof of what they're like together could set the that set the tone for who to hold for the longer term well ISAC to hav game six that sounds fantastic as well I think he does and I think having you know not having sacker in your team does allow you to have Sun instead and you know there's obviously going to be the parallels do you have sacker and salanki or havs and I think you'd want double double up on attack right oh yeah oh yeah definitely for those three games but I'm thinking that longer term after that there's a there's a reason to have like only one Arsenal attacker as your coverage and if it's if it looks if havitz is performing better than let's say Jackson and sank it gives you more impetus to have like the another attacker from Chelsea or spurs in your Midfield yep Fair okay um just add do you want to mention anything else no that's fine on that yeah I'll just mention very quickly as going a little bit over time but um dunk uh 4.5 million 6.7% owned I don't you really see a reason why you wouldn't just put him on your wild card like the next two sound fantastic um they've kept one clean sheet so far at a three like they look better defensively these ipwi ipwi and not in Forest at home is obviously great Chelsea and top them after that not great but you can bench him then Newcastle wolves uh okay you can play him Liverpool Man City after that not great but 12 onwards again bourma Southampton Fulham Leicester Crystal Palace West United brenford like that that run is great so if you're looking for a cheap Defender like I think just stick him there you can just bench him with someone um yeah so always worth a shot on goal as well like even own goal so be aware of that but at the same time like next two looks so good like if switch have 1.21 XG of over three games which is 20 in the league wow so by far the worst um XG so like that looks like it should be a nailed on clean sheet at at home for Bri um and then yeah n and Forest 4.78 XG but they've only scored three goals so that looks like a good good cheap clean sheet possibility as well so yeah 3.9 XGC is eighth of all teams and that's only 0.2 behind Arsenal's like obviously Elite backline that we've seen over the past season so yeah one shot four key passes one big chance created like lots of fullbacks don't get one big chance created so yeah um I like him I think he's gonna be um you know spoilers for my team if I'm not wild carding I'll be getting him in for Hall who's in my team the so yeah nice should we talk about our teams then yes let's do it so you I'm still surprised you say you might steal wild wild card uh yeah it's just the the the jotter thing I think is a is a worry just because of um you Darwin like I I don't but like so if J doesn't play but obviously he'll probably come off the bench won't he so maybe that's not even that much of an issue if J doesn't start like he can come off the bench against forest and probably do something so um yeah thank you so um yeah Hall two um dunk seems likely and then I'll I'll be benching one of Pedro Ora and I have no idea who yet um and then yeah Bailey is now injured apparently for Villa so Rogers like I've been tempted to just play Smith row and just like not double up but at the same time Roger X minutes have gone up again with Bailey out but Bailey out affects their attack probably so yeah and then again if Waters Watkins is injured then that puts it another bloody FL suppose I yeah I suppose I could um it will be interesting to see how they manage his minutes because they've got that Champions League game away on the in the week it was just like a small he's been playing the games yeah he's been going off early he's had two weeks rest like surely absolutely fine yeah surely like I expect probably play like 60 70 minutes though again yeah maybe maybe um Duran's been Obviously good but like Watkins is their star like there's no way he's getting benched randomly if he's not injured so um and yeah isak I still think is is you know he's talked about people owning him and selling him in FPL asn't he and he's he's ready for a brace as he says so um yeah happy to own isach still I think this is a great fixure for him walls have been conceding for fun um so like that um yeah so I I will have cover if I make that move for Hall to to dunk for whatever happens I guess um just yeah I'm gonna have to a z z in the the Northland derby with Pedro clean sheet that' be nice but you have play you'd have to play mate anyway what would actually like flip you into wanting to wild card because the team looks okay if you heard what Watkins and Y were out yeah yeah that basically and sck oh yeah sck's yeah okay sck would be fine like yeah so if J um yeah if nunas is is said to be getting the the nod then then that would affect things as I said like jot on Off the Bench is probably not that bad but yeah if Watkins is injured oh yeah those two would be a big thing yeah no I think I think it yeah and I think dunk is probably I could get Muno for Palace against Leicester at home that seems good but say I don't want double up of pal defense so and he's point five more expensive and I've got one in the bank and I just want to just keep that that sort of change there no I agree I agree no I think the team looks good for this week I think if I think if Everton is the The Villa fixer evon's the the one which is going to make it just because of the the two of them there yeah I I put my team on Twitter and saying like this looks like an obvious wild card right and then and most people were just like you're an idiot yeah okay fair enough yeah I kind of think absolutely not I wouldn't don't think you need a wild card I it looks good for this week to be honest but yeah as soon as if you do get dunk yeah playing him I think that just adds that extra layer to who would you play out of porro and I'd probably play porro probably and then you'd play Smith instead of Rogers yeah probably probably yeah yeah because Smith thr surely he's had two weeks off he's had no International Duty yeah just he's surely he can play night now yeah you would think so you would think so and I think that fixture is good is yeah yeah don't yeah I'd probably play I'd back the home fixture for porro and the slightly greater attacking output from open Play and then I would probably probably play Smith row over Rogers but yeah it's close it's close it is yeah people saying Roger is gonna be a pen he's like no I don't know about that I think it's be Tans isn't it yeah it is tons simply put yeah and then it's mcin after that and then maybe Watkins not Rogers there not Rogers now I don't think so be good if it was um yeah right let's have a quick look here is that all all yeah yeah lovely so you're so you're only going to take a one one transfer at most aren't you you not no no hits this week you know minus 12 you nice yeah just just the one I think oh B hard otherwise nothing um so my team is Henderson in goal CBA Robinson and coner at the back and i' heard that coner got injured last night which is a bit irritating because he's been like my nice sleeper defender on the bench for these two fixtures yeah i' I put a tweet out about that seeing asking what's actually happened to him and no responses so I don't know well he went off and then it's apparently it sounded bad but then afterwards Carley said he looked okay to me but I haven't spoken to him so who knows I'm going to be waiting until that but anyway I'm going to play him and if he doesn't play Then porro is going to come on got Bruno obviously still he's such a difficult one this week because South Hampton looks like a juicy fixture of hoan's back um he returned returned for Portugal so yeah well he's always returning for bloody Portugal and not nfpl and I got As A Smith row sacka munis isach and harand so at the moment this week yeah I think I'm hoping that he's good this week so I'm looking at maybe doing one of two things I'm either really conservative and I just do celba to Trent with my one free transfer just so I'm on a Liverpool a little bit and I keep sacka and I keep Bruno or I take a minus four and do CBA sacka and Bruno to Trent Salah and minty that's my other option I think oh okay so you got two free transfers got two free transfers yeah so I kind of think I think sacka I think salah's going to outscore sacka this week I think Bruno could outscore minty for even though he hasn't so far this season I think this is the game he probably could but I'm confident Trent will so I just don't know if it's worth a full fourpoint hit but then I like to be on that ahead of next game week where I probably will Captain Salah so yeah and just Bruno hasn't lived up to his price in the first three games or United haven't their attacking numbers aren't good I kind of fancy a little bit of those Brighton games even though min's a bit of a 70 to 80 minute person he has actually returned so yeah don't know what do you think about that I I like the Bruno f obviously so there's that um so maybe just the SLE move but yeah at the same time like Salah and M and Trent those all sound good too so the other option is which is was it at the start of the week but that's leso now is isach to Pedro Saka to Salah CBA to Trent obviously these are for minus four next I'm using is to Pedro Saka to Salah and CA to Trent yeah but I the only reason I would probably favor the Bruno move is because I think isak's probably more likely to score points in the next two than Bruno is I still just don't know if I trust him enough and yeah so that's what not note to both of us stop picking Brun I know stupid yeah stupid when did you get rid of him who did you get rid of him for I got Rogers ands it yeah that was it that was last week it was it was Bruno and um chitson to Watkins and Rogers yeah so I feel like that yeah I definitely want some some Liverpool players this week and CA is an easy transfer out because I can do that anyway so I can just get Trent for him that's and that's a massive upgrade this and next week um and then it's just a question of whether I fancy Saka to do well against Spurs and Bruno to do anything against Southampton or just play it safe and get Salah and minty who probably will outscore them both this week and next as well so yeah yeah just I'm probably going to do the minus four and then just leave the team as is until game ex wild card so yeah we'll see cool all right does that wrap us up I think so we did a long show tonight yep it's because we're excited to be playing FB again aren't we yeah we're we're back thankfully yeah right we'll hope for um good weekends and um yeah have we got anything else to add final thoughts Holland to break his leg all right that's what a nice note to end on what a lovely sa oh yeah all right well let's hope that doesn't happen and let's hope they both score the same amount of points this game week how about that yeah the just same amount of points for the whole season lovely all right well thanks everyone for for watching and we'll we'll catch you next week unless is another International break yeah bye everyone good luck everyone have a,13294,hello all right how are you doing its a week earlier this season isnt it as well so just got going yep so 74 it was above average but its still a red arrow so ive had only red arrows to start of the season so thats not gone great but salah coming in clutch at the end of the week thankfully to match holland and bench pedro against arsenal i think i was never going to play him i dont think so that just is what it is but i wasnt going to play him like smith row had like was it ip switch and then rogers had a good fixture as well and against leicester so i was just like why would i play pedro is what it is 74 r 13m ive never been this low at the start of the season so before so uncharted ter for me and hopefully i can just start to get back up there because you had a good game week one i think its there probably like a little bit of lb from people using triple captain in game week one and i always think like the ranks always bench beast as well i always think ranks are a little bit bloated at the start of the season because some players will play like newer players or not newer players but people who arent taking it seriously will wild card and youre right bench boost in my for instance my work mini league who is full of people or some people that dont take it as seriously as perhaps we might like chips have been thrown down gams one two and three with triple captains and bench boost so im putting some of it down to that as well so lets roll with roll with that all right what happened to me i had another harland hatrick which was lovely but then salah just he bit back again which i was bit disappointed about i didnt did i make any moves i dont think i did i think i rolled the transfer i contemplate didnt i getting rid of bruno for buo which would have been nice didnt go for it in the end and thats quite a lot of mis points but the transfers will come in handy this week i think i got 77 holland captain c e got 10 that was about it didnt have any clean sheets but robinson got an assist and esack got some points it was pretty bare those two are the big difference i think as and robinson absolutely so it was a close game weekend i had a green aror but its nothing too exciting 22m lets see where we are after like game week 10 or 12 when were like a third of the way through the season and for in the millions then we can start panicking exactly right lets lets talk a little bit about this upcoming game week theres been a load of talk i think about wild card being played i nearly did it youve been talking about it a lot are you still nearly done it a few times as well im still undecided to be honest but i just think it seems early i think like youre right in previous seasons we would have thought about wild carding in the first international break because its only three game weeks this season that almost feels too early as well to be honest there been huge market movement like if i look at the front page of the premier league fpl site pedro diaz harland salah all like the top transfers in anana is in there as well from villa and then people are like transferring out some good players esack gone watkins sacka gardial palmer i think its three weeks is palmer like what i know i know hes been training i know its crazy but i think that to make it a wild card at the moment the reason ive probably gone and not done it is because i havent found a wild card draft that i feel comfortable with i feel like i still dont know enough about each of the players and the same i think ive ive tried to put things together and ive just not ive been like maybe like 05 short of like a good team that i like and its just like so at that point i would have to do a significant downgrade to someone where im just not not wanting to do that but at the same time hopefully in a few weeks like cheaper assets will come forward because like im going to start being priced out of the players that on this wild card i wont be able to get them because ill be rising up in prices and things so i gotta hope watkins comes back this week and stuff like that and hopefully i can see him training soon because hes a worry because if hes out then im gonna have to wild card for sure because thats another player and j who knows whats happening with him just because darwins not gone on international break hes been training two weeks of slot so theres that worry as well he might play and then all the do i want arsenal players anymore considering all the the other issues so what do you this is a bit more of a wider point you were you were quite like firm at the start of the season and still now that you didnt think harem was good value and i think a lot of wild cards been played to double up on what just get both harand and salah do you still think even if you had the war card to play now and when you play in the future do you still think youre more minded to have one rather than the other i think i would probably still not have harand when ive been looking at drafts ive not been including harland i think thats thats probably like reflective good pricing theres probably times to season where we want both but i feel the same when im looking at the teams i can do and i see drafts on twitter i think a team with both of them in just seems like so bloated for two assets and the rest of the team around it at the moment are filled with like picks we dont know are going to be any good even so even with only just salah im still looking at a drafts where its like ive got two five million midfielders in there its just like its just because im trying to spend ive been looking at son ive been looking at watkins pedro and isak still like i want to keep e still i still want to keep walk so it was expensive forward line as well so but son sun would probably have to go in that scenario unfortunately but i like sun well talk about him later but well should we talk about some matches from this weekend and get excited about that and then perhaps wrap up at the end by talking about like picks we like for the for wild card yep do you want to do you want to kick off with the tottenham and arsenal game sure so so north l and derby i think its the last game of the week on the sunday night isnt it it might be lets a look 2 o fine last six results in the premier league spurs have had four losses one win one draw they scored nine goals arsenal one loss four wins one draw the opposite 13 goals scored form wise over the first three fixtures spurs surprisingly xg 488 which is which they scored six goals which is seventh overall for teams and then an xgc of 36 the three conceeded which is sixth best but thats better than arsenals xgc and better than the arsenals xg which is 448 and arsenals xgc is 37 so like spurs are beating arsenal in the attacking and defensive metrics in the data by the amount conceded arsenal conceded what is it like one and spurs was conceded three but still like number wise analytic wise spurs are in better form to be honest so interesting so rice is banned for this one which is a bit of concern i think its an offensive concern as well with his quality pieces his link up play as well and not being available in those phases of attacking seems to be is going to be an issue i think but at the same time they could probably play havit back there they can push him back into a pivot with parte and maybe georgino possibly so i dont think like the quality is that much of a drop off odard is also a bit of an issue as well hes like unofficially been saying hes going to be out for about three weeks i heard that too so maybe not the end of the world but possibly the end of the world in terms of maybe even this early in terms of the title race if they lose to spurs and city and the next two theyre going to be quite a bit behind already so i think its a bad time for them to lose youre right like three weeks now theres like two such important away fixtures which probably two of their the most difficult are going to be this season because spurs are always up for the north london derby and city are going to want to put one over on them start of the season of course so just sacks record versus sps in the last six in the premier league so hes scored three goals and two assists there pretty good and then suns record versus arsenal in the last six is five goals so thats pretty good too both main attackers from each team have good history and form in this fixture so i would say most likely outcome is both teams to score so i think in my position ive got a ca and parro in my team ill be looking to start only one of them and its not clear which one is going to be the best to be honest because spurs are at home the data would say spur porro is better because hes hes quite attacking as well but then at the same time like spurs definitely going to concede and is he going to do anything attacking wise like who knows because their defense isnt massively changed like theyre still front their back four is still the same ry is still there like i george yo is going to protect as hopefully with party as well like both of them will do the job re rice does so i dont think its g be too bad defensively so at the moment im leaning towards cber starting but at the same time like i dont feel comfortable about it so and porro is maybe more fun i dont know like its its hard its its hard like i 5050 choice maybe back the home team but arsenal u the elite defense not this season so far but they have only conceded one and they kept two clean sheets out of three so but i think all attackers are worth playing here like hav sun sacka they all seem like good picks if slanks back could do fine hes probably a worse pick than someone like son think in this because i think hes probably going to get marked out the game by sber or gabrielle so and the big thing is probably hav people were looking at him on wild card and stuff like that and ive ive been saying hes like such a good asset which i still think he is but like if hes going to start to play in the midfield three over the next two thats going to dent his appeal a bit i think its its a good thing hes going to play like or from our selfish fpl point of you cuz i dont think many people will be investing in arsenal assets like now game we four and gw five but wild card 6 which looks like a prime window in arsenal got three good fixtures then like if he is if od guards back in and havit is back up front by then it theres no fa missing out of his points and hopefully he remains still a bit of a sleeper pick because i bit on him later but his like points per million value at the moment is far better than sacka and hes nearly matched him for points so far this season and i think hes theres a theres a case for having havs only from game week six onwards to free up money in your midfields you dont necessarily need sacka but inter i agree with you about arsenal this weekend i think were taking two of their main three midfielders lets say out of the side is gonna have its gonna have a big impact theres no question about that and the back arent as good i was watching a bit of planet fbl and they got a guy called clayton on there and hes an arsenal fan and hes just he was just saying that like he doesnt think its going to be that much of an issue i think theyre theyre good enough their team and the squad is good enough to like beat a ter a bad spur well theyre not bad spur side but i still think theyre like good enough quality to still beat them and i think the players coming in is more of a system rather than straight like for like players and those players can come in and do a job like georgino i think it was last year when he started playing games like he was good like he was he was not a weak link at all so well see but i think the attackers could i still think saaka like odard is the one thats usually linking up with him but i hell probably get more space on that side now because hes hes gonna have less people occupying his zone and s saka do well in this fixture last season remember he had like a goalen assist perhaps and i think hits had the same so i think youre right its going to be an open game and im think it not wouldnt be surprised if sak have us both return again this game week and return well i still like it from s like a lot of people are looking at sacka to salah and stuff like that to get salah in people have just harland and i see that but i could see sacka getting something in this for sure absolutely all right should we move on a chat a little bit about liverpool and forest it be good to hear your thoughts i no its jammer in the chat sorry about the timing mentioned that he was looking to move away from liverpool assets in gw six and i think its its interesting i just theyve got such good fixures over the next two and theyve shown such great promise in the start of the season it seems surprising to hear that wolves away crystal palace away and then chelsea home after six like those two are definitely still good like i think i watched a bit of raptors video as well saying that like if you wild card in seven or eight you can keep those liverpool players those two fixtures longer those good two away fixtures whereas the other people are probably moving off them and youve got a salah against wolves and palace who look bad defensively so well i think just speaking about this game specifically in terms of projected goals and clean sheet odds liverpool coming 28 expected goals this game week 46 chance of the clean sheet thats only very slightly behind city this game week forest with a expected goal rate of 07 6 clean sheet rate so the odds are favoring a big liverpool win here and now like im not surprised salah had hes played some minutes over the international break but i think hes going to be fine coming back into the into the team and interesting topic that we talk about every week is how well hes hes going to keep pace with harand or how well harlands going to keep pace with salah this season and thats going to be like the i think the main crux of our like talking point all season long five big chances so far this season thats thats second overall hes had hes had four big chances created which is first so i think the difference between harand and harand and salah so far this season is salahs creativity harand hasnt got that so if his if his goals drop off salahs getting the the points from creative outlets as well and i think in this game hes got another good chance to to score well and id be interested to see considering their similar matchups who people who if people own both salah and harland who theyre most likely going to captain and perhaps people in the comments or in the chat who have got both can tell us 14 10 and 17 in the last three so i imagine for you hes going to be nailed on captain this week i think so theres watkins with a good picture walks bit of an issue but i think isaac could be a good fixture too and then i think thats probably maybe even pedro that seems stupid but just because its like price point but that its home fixture thats thats gc is good its good i want to get your thoughts on diaz right because hes hes predicted to maybe rise in price like2 over this international break i was like considering on that sunday night but it was like that postmatch thing of like man i want that player thats thats done well but its a small sample size so far this season in three games which is again one of the reasons why i havt played the wild card and what were seeing in these first three game weeks i dont know if its like a purple patch rather or purple patch rather than like its its a indication of what his season long form is so i had to look at what is i appreciate its under different managers but hes providing an attack and return this season every 56 minutes last season it was every 175 5 minutes so that comes down to two things has he got that much better over the summer or is he playing in a side that suits him better and gives him more license to do things and then if you look even more at his numbers so 076 xg per 90 so far this season against 041 xg per9 last season so hes roughly nearly doubled his expected goal output so far this season and i think thats why its so difficult to make like cut and dry decisions on these type of players who are i dont know who havent been like big fpl heroes in the in the past i think hes hes popular now but im not sure if its if its going to last what where do you sit on or where do you come on down on that i think youre probably right in like he probably has got better the system probably does suit him a bit more but at the same time like that is probably a little bit unsustainable i think hes just been fortunate to get on the back of some of the things and the ball for the his second against united i think just like happened to land in the spot where he just rifled at home first time like maybe thats good for him where he was just being in that position but at the same time like hes like i dont know a yard the other way he doesnt he doesnt get that chance so like hes a good pick like is but like hes coming back gl from south america just as someone like pedro like nobody thinks thats going to be an issue but gs been playing in europe and darwins not played at all like gapco probably deserves some time like the slot hasnt rotated anyone so far i think apart from quansa so is he just so is he just gonna keep playing his first maybe 11 until he doesnt need to like and its the start of the champions league isnt it so weve got com back from international break into like another three games in a week spell so im sure there will be rotation like hes already not played diaz for full 90s in two of the opening three games what youre paying a lot more for salah but youre getting those 90s i coming around to the main question like for people who dont have a salah team and for people who are maybe going to wild card salah out in a few game weeks is diaz like a good enough cover but i think probably the answer to that is going to come with more data more knowledge of how he how he plays in this system like weve got three games to judge and one of those hes hes blanked in and anyway i just think its interesting because hes near up to nearly 17 now up to near preseason and kungu levels of ownership and its just its just interesting he player i looked at but im just not quite so sure on him i think i think hell probably do the thing where like his front three he plays his first 11 and then he just takes off d as jotter probably around the 60 mark and then j off salar off maybe around the 80 i could see that happening and then those three maybe trent again as well like the ones that he needs to be fit constantly just take them off a bit earlier see that happening ive been so lucky with trent im just going to mention him briefly but like its criminal that i overlooked him i went off last seasons forming that liverpool were not great defensively last season they had eight clean sheets all season didnt think they were going to make much of a difference theyve got like three already so nearly half of that total after three game weeks and trent has been so unlucky not to return big as well like that disallowed goal against united should have had a an assist for yter in the brenford game i think it was and in the i switch game so im hes like on my definite bring in list this game week and i cant sit through another pool game like knowing that i could be on the end of a beating but hes been a beast and he was good for england got the assist last night for kane i just think he looks good sh and then just quickly on forest defensively before we move on theyre i was quite surprised so the projected goals and clean sheet odds heavily in liveable favor but they have been decent defensively so far the season theyve not played the same caliber of opponent but theyre third best for expected goals conceded after three games liverpool on 21 expected goals and seated forest 25 i think its city is the other team in that mix theyve conceded five big chances which is the same as liverpool and like i said theyve had good fixtures we knew that but theyve theyve still performed and done well so i think it will be a i think it will be a tighter game than the man united game and maybe the most defensive team liverpool have played so far i think that i think that minkovich has made a difference he is a solid and good defender i feel like they num would certainly start to drop off with them with playing better teams i think liverpool should get like a twonil win that seems fine to me will forest score do you see that i dont think so i dont i think that theyve only theyve had like the good fixtures at the start of this season and theyve only they only scored two in or is it three in three games i think wood scored two and more gibs white scored the other one maybe so theyve had like good fixtures and theyve not like scored multiple so i think theyd be surprised if they even scored one im just checking it was one i think it was 111 one nil and one1 wasnt it so theyve not blown teams away and a lot of people are looking at double defense for liverpool and wild card which i understand from the three games but at the same time theyve faced not very good oppos opposition as well so man united you probably wouldnt expect a clean sheet theyre still capable so are they going to be like back to being good like defensively he remains to be seen but i think a double up feels a little bit rich so also robertson is pretty attacking so i think robertson has look like again hes looked good and hes on some set pieces hes slightly less expensive than trent but like i hes like a million cheaper but i dont know if id have robertson over trent id only have it as like a double and then and then youre right i dont know if i trust a double enough but allison in goal is scored more points so far this season than trent but despite that i still dont think id double up with a defender and a goalkeeper from liverpool fair okay so for versus chelsea next one ive decided to look at so chelsea form wise zero clean sheets so far five conceded an xgc of 32 who which is weirdly fourth best which i didnt see coming so their defense is looking pretty good like considering they play man city as well 37 shots for them which is midtable of all teams 11 big chances which is third of all teams and next year of 508 which is sixth and then seven goals scored they scored six of them in that one game so maybe slightly inflated there as well bournemouth wise their xg of 59 n which is third of all teams which is great for bourma 10 big chances sixth overall five goal scored xgc of 47 is 13th worst zero clean sheets and theyve conceded four so defense is not looking good probably looks good for palmer returns jackson returns things like that yes seeno he seems to be the hot pick at the moment 56m hes already ris once only 5 owned when i made these notes its probably gone up since then not blanked yet eight five and six for a player from bournemouth pretty good 19 points in three games so hes hes excellent considering his team but perhaps inflated by their fical difficulty of the first three of not in for away newcastle at home which newcastle away seemed to be worse and then everton away like those fixtures not too bad so maybe thats been inflated but then the fixtures from now on are pretty mixed so people are starting to bring them in but their fixtures are rough so chelsea at home this week that could be a competitive game he still could still get returns liverpool way after that southampton home good leicester away is good good arsenal at home tough ason away and then man city home after that so thats a tough run that eight to 10 he he is 56m you can bench him you could probably sell him for someone back to like a smith r like that so like his price and his value seems to be good like those fixtures after chelsea and liverpool those two in the middle there are great so i think hes probably a fine pickup but so 17 shots puts in first for all players although that didnt include harland in the stats for some reason it just harand just wasnt showing up dont know why ask ff hub why that was happening but hes there now but you think hes second to him so okay fair enough so hes had two big chances xg of 119 key passes of four big chances created of two and xa of 13 so i dont think his numbers look that amazing hes only had one bonus despite returning in all three games i was surprised about that as well i thought he would have hed some bonus as well absolutely same so i dont think his returns are sustainable is what im trying to say but then again that at 55m whos not risen yet tavanir hes played pretty much the same minutes hes only played six few minutes hes at 03 owned his xg is beating sos with 21 versus 12 and their expected points taverners is higher on 20 versus 17 so hes had one goal versus sanu two goals and one assist but at the same time like theres a player whos got more xg maybe thats just saying that like seenu has been a little bit fortunate to get these whereas others havent got them and hes still at 55 you dont you can say that 01 as well he might be might be good for that and hes playing hes fit hes hes usually a talent man for that b up team so his expected points rate is higher than s after the thir game weeks as well so exactly thats which does surprise me considering the returns so im not saying pick him or anything its just a matchup focus wise like tavanir could be someone does well in this one as well i like it i like it i fancy b up to win this game to be honest like their expected goals youre right probably slightly higher because chelsea have played city theyre still theyre still decent chelsea padded those numbers by scoring six against wolves so no i think this is going to be quite an open game and i wouldnt be surprised to see simenia continue his run and what i quite like about bournemouth now even though they like clawed it back late against ever so you cant say that was like a good performance i think theyre still trying to like work out how their team is plays without sanky and it seems like theyve got lots of inexpensive players who were chipping into to make the goals happen so maybe thats not great from an fpl point of view because its a bit of a spread but it does mean there are some some a lot of options potentially i think that evan nelson like i said is a quality player as well once he just settles down and starts to start hitting some goals he might be on penalties as well because he theyll probably want to give it to him to start game scoring goals so hell hes six million hes going to be a good route when they have a good run of fixtures its because the striker picks are limited arent they and hes going to be a decent option ill talk about palmer eventually when we talk about wild card pick thats why ive not mentioned him yet cool from 11 to n to 20 i was just having a look on the ticker they bic got like a green or gray fixture run according to fpl the only like gray marked games theyve got spurs at home which they can score in man united away which they absolutely can score in and full them away so they a good run of games from game week 11 so i like the look of them right lets sorry theyre cheap as well so its going to be easy to get on to them exactly lets just quickly talk about city and brenford then so projected goals and clean sheet ods like i mentioned against for po i wanted to just compare the two of them man city slightly higher predicted goals this game week 2 9 to liverpool or 295 to liverpools 28 exactly strange because liverpools next year is higher than citys i thought the same too and i think its just based on last season odds as well but 46 chance for clean sheet is the same as liverpool forest have a sorry brenford again almost the same in terms of projected goals 76 and a 5 clean sheet also i dont know why the returns dont quite marry up but so there bookies are expecting man city to score slightly higher goals negligible har brenford considering that their against city recently i think theyve been quite good against city as well and like last season in i think it was the double game week when we all triple captain harland they played brenford at home and harland just got a single goal in that game and he struggled again in the way game against brenford i think that was one of the first games after he came back from injury when foden got a hattrick but he hasnt been he hasnt been great against brenford in previous seasons and the season before that they beat them at they had here so but hes been in great form this season 23 i love that this season exactly 23 big chances per average per game this season 12 xg average per game so i think the main question is how much can he keep this up or what can he keep up so far the season because his price has gone up now so 152 for him for anyone thats getting on is its quite a big j didnt take much to go up in price and his ownership just too bad by hacks true 67 ownership now i think he was like 50 when the season started so weve had a lot of converts i just looking at i think the main reason youre going to have to own harand is because you want to cap in every week i dont think you can own him and not think about captaining him every week so i was having a look at the fixes you got coming up so brenford arsenal and newcastle and next three games i think you can cap him in the brenford game and you can probably now captain in the arsenal game without rice and potentially odard there i think that makes it more of like a mustwin game for city and the newcastle game they havent been like great defensively so i think fine but if youre looking for alternatives in the arsenal game salah got a plum fixture that game week suns got a good game during that game week and then 7 to 12 i was looking at these fixtures thinking theres no reason i wouldnt want to captain him in all of these games fulham at home wolves away southampt at home is the next juicy one for people talking about triple captain bournemouth away brighton away is maybe the most tricky one and then tottenham at home so i think its at the moment like for me i like its difficult because i like the salah drafts more at the moment but i think the fomo of not having haren captain is almost is too great and that but and i also dont like the double up like i say because of the weaker team so it and i think as soon as one of them has like a blank this season theres going to be so much transfer activity of been like my god sals blanked weve got to take him out and get harland or my god harlands not worth 152 and that will absolutely happen therell be so many transfers either way wont there i feel like its g one of them is gon to blank this week i feel like its the week that one of them is its more likely to be sal do you think i was going to sayland but i think thats thats whats great so far about this season because you can either try both in a team and like have cheaper players around it which jammer in the chat earlier said hes done with good success because hes doing better than both of us at the moment but i dont know i dont like living with the fomo anyway its its interesting hes playing out of his skin so far this season and seven goals in three games just apparently he put up an absolute state like one of the worst performan hes ever had apparently in the norway first game finished nil and its just like odard and har in that game its nil against kazakhstan its like i saw some report put up just like some absolute just slog fest at holland the worst game hes ever seen him play and he was just utterly awful so thats funny but he can have like the very odd bad game like that game against arsenal last season at home was poor and thats probably one of the reasons why i want to bring in s in the next two game weeks just to cover that arsenal game where im not sure dont even think its that odd that he has bag like got often games where he just disappears and he just doesnt make any but like whats been the difference so far this season is like hes still not getting the touches but hes just getting the one touch to finish some of his finishes were just crazy that second goal against west ham he just like touched it and then beled it in and even the third one thinking like is he how would the defense g him so much time as well he just had so much time to just take a touch and just launch it but even as it finishes against z swit apart from the penalty were pretty good as well so i thought kilman would do a number on him but no it didnt happen its down to nathan collins this week come on collins lad no im loving it at the moment i think its i think its its great that weve got like the diverse captain picks but i feel like as soon as one of them blanks is going to be mass hysteria and panic im all for that im scared what el i got to say about this one just i think thats was pretty much it on the only other player on city is worth talking about is lewis like hes gone up to 47 now 14 points in his first three games a six a two and a six thats just despite the fact theyve lost two clean sheets hes got an attacking return he hit the cross bar in that i switch game per personally hes like not for me because he falls into that category of man city defender which has notoriously been apart from probably canelo and gardial at the end of last season is always a bit of a rotation risk but hes played three 90 minutes so far this season and maybe hes taking that spot from walker and a is now injured so i was gonna say like ak is now injured so like people seem to think thats going to help vardal which sure it will but like at the same time we saw lewis play left back for england last night so like he can play left back as well i just think it makes his ex mens go up as well if not more so walker could play and then lewis could play on the left like give guardio a game off like that could happen but at the same time like lewis hes playing all the games so maybe he needs a game off so i think if youre on wild card and you can afford like he is just 47m and you can rotate him or whatever and you can or if you play him you can afford for who ever comes on to do is a decent sub or whatever then he probably is a good pick well im the same time i think he probably will get minutes off the bench every if he does age so theres theres that it will be frustrating im just having a look at that they havent got that many defenders in fpl theyve only got seven one of them z whos probably injured now for some length of time it sounded like it was quite bad stones and walker have barely played probably because hes a bit like foden hes bringing back up to speed slowly because they all last night though so did he play 490 i think so i dont know but so i assume hes fit now well anyway it just be interesting to see how again i wouldnt want to take a punt on him this early because im so conservative but and also i dont think i dont think city are that reliable for clean or as reliable for clean shits even though hes only 47 so i dont know what do you think hes hes probably not for me hes not my player but i think if hes if hes still starting every game by the time i wild card then ill ill be looking at him i think but now if i was going to do it now i would probably want that one maverick pick and he probably would be it harry in the chat said pet rette is about to come into force anytime now ucl starting for picking and i agree especially when it comes to the their defense in three games next week and the fact that the arsenal game is at the end of like the champions league week makes you think there will be some rotation maybe the rotation will be in ucl but definitely something to keep an eye on i think if anyone is looking to sell sacker as well if youre not going to salah or whatever like de bruyne for the bford game seems hes played all three 90s he started all three of them i think thats interesting he could easily get benched before champions league as well though but de bry fun hes hes super low owned as well what is he 11 thats not bad is it 96m and then weve got foden to come back in sometime who knows when thats goingon to be though like no idea he played 45 minutes against chelsea and then he disappeared again so maybe time for the first i just had a look at the minutes he played 45 minutes against chelsea and then hes not played since i dont even remember that never do i okay fair enough gs played more minutes than so i think its still too early to make some decisions on city mids sh we talk about some wild card picks briefly yep and talk about okay so the guy who i didnt mention the chelsea bournemouth one was palmer 106m now 41 owned like most the twitter sphere has not owned in most of the season but 41 is crazy bournemouth away next west ham away after that brighton at home not forest at home those two in a row seemed good liverpool away and then newcastle at home so those two after that not so good but 276 from three games so far five returns from an xgi of 19 bruno has had zero returns from an xgi of two 20 so theres theres fpl for you in a nut show ridiculous so the fixtures to me like look ins s enticing on paper but im less im less sure bournemouth have looked like pretty competitive so far west ham have a good team but like they did can see quite a few toand and then brighton and forest no walk no walkovers anymore thats for sure so that those two games should be competitive just because chelsea are know near as good as they have been so i would definitely include on one card for sure like he is a top pick absolutely but i do think the runner is the run is like tougher than it on paper like he so i had to look at his appearances for like in the premier league and for chelsea and stuff against these teams so two appearances versus bournemouth like hes had one assist two appearances versus west ham hes had one goal four appearances versus brighton so this is probably while being part of city team but one goal against them and then three appearances versus forest and one assist so he has he has had returns against all the next four but theyre not hes not hauling hes not having massive returns like but the same like 106m for like a goal like every game or a return a game but that seems fine well not majorly fine but still passable what do you think about him i would absolutely own him on my god i think it i think if i was wild carding this week and a lot of people wild carded last week to get him in if i was wild carding him this week i would probably have him as well yet over sacka and then i think a play would probably not to go with harand because i dont think you can probably have like harand salah and palmer and a and a decent squad around that i think hes been blown up by that huge game against wolves like seven the 17 point pointer there he shown last season hes capable of that i think hes i think hes absolutely solo pick and i think whats quite nice about this start of this season is the way they the midfielders have like returned in line with that like salah is the most expensive and hes led the way slightly after that palmer is slightly outscored sacka and then around just underneath sacka youve got sun so i think the pricing is aligned to how theyve scored so far and thats what i said what i said last when we talked about surprises and stuff like i havent been surprised by these players so i know so no i think i like palmer i also like sack at the moment what were find is we cant have more but if i was going to wild card this week i would probably have palmer over sacka and back him to do well he seems to be playing that number 10 roll well he could have returned more against palace it looked like quite an open game so there were times in the highlights where he was like he and the chelsea players were just like running at three people in palace defense and henderson somehow bailed them out so and hes hes more expensive than the second so its easy to get back as well absolutely sure okay well and hes probably not that much of a surprise but his ownership is only eight and thats in buo so i dont think even if youre on wild card now its like its necessarily a bad time to get him in so i think hes proven his worth already as the fifth highest scoring mid and its so annoying because we knew he was going to be good he started last season well had such a great season until he got injured and that derailed him a little bit but hes hes proven himself as a good fpl player he monopolizes set pieces hes a good finisher and hes got 24 points after three games so far the season i think if youre on a wild card now its like not a bad time to preamp getting him for his good run i think only this city game is tricky and then spurs away i think we talked about it the other week i would fancy him to get g to get a return against spurs away and then after that his and brentfords run is nice we talked about before game week six to 12 its all greens and grays on the fixture ticker so i think hes as important to his club as is to his monopolized set pieces he gets that extra point those are all things we already know so im surprised are you surprised hes still only 8 well i think for people wild carding now is they might look at the next two and be like i can probably not go there but even for me or you that possibly arent wild carding now like we could look at the next two and be like probably back against that look at him from six seven on i just feel like game week five is like the sneaky pick for him i feel like could he could do well in that game and wait an extra week why not get on him early but ne the j j to him in game five work nice okay you got any anyone to talk about so robinson and we did mention him a little bit earlier three sixes so far no bonus but only 65 owned i think li we said i think you would own him with trent if youre going to do it but he absolutely is the ey test at the moment so ive got a little american football analogy like trent feels like hes like the quarterback whereas robinson feels like hes like a wide receiver like getting high and wide and providing like good goal threat as from a defensive angle so he passes the ey test he doesnt necessarily pass the stats test where hes got five key passes which is third that doesnt necessarily lead to any goals or assists and stuff but 3 xg which is 11 football defenders two shots which is not that high hes had threatening shots at least xa of 039 big chance he created is zero and one big chance himself so he looks like hes probably g to be getting more attacking goals possibly than assists so like i said his stats dont jump off the page its more of a grass pick than analytical pick 22 xgc for poool is the best defensive numbers in the premier league so far with zero goals conceded if we assume their defense is still going to be good and they can keep clean sheets the floor for robertson can now be a clean sheet and hes got much like attacking potential a much higher upside than he did before because he was always looking at like a base of two liverpool were conceding all the time and trent had more a threat whereas now got possibly a base of six which hes hes proved so far in his three matches and hes hes just like trent has been unlucky to not get attacking returns so i think if youre picking on one card like those two at the back for the next three or four at least seem great to me its just i think you absolutely pick trent and robinson is just someone you could just pick on the side as just a low upside pick no i like the robin pick as well i think if to go with salah hes hes going to be nailed on and like we said earlier i think hes hes got the capability of getting a return because hes on some corners and set pieces as well so i think a lot of it relies on liverpools defense being good so will remains to be you see so say same with trent as well theyve both been been taken off bit early which is it can be good for defenders as well so theyve got that possibility too on other wild card pick so again maybe ive done a couple more i think minty is someone who are impressed us in preseason and has been like okay so far this season without being like great hes been outperformed by mata matoma but appreciate hes probably not hes not as expensive as that and ad ringers done well hes got two returns in three games a 42 and a four he was the one that had the big chance against arsenal that rey saved and pedro followed in on to got the assist in that way and in the everton game he came off at half time when he got his concussion so theres who can say what he would have done in the second half but he would have at least got two more points from that so hes an interesting pick hes hes certainly not as popular as pedro welbeck but i think hes pretty well priced mid if you switching to a 352 he looks more attacking than someone like smith r who ive had and for all mids under 57 hes fairing not too badly so hes hes not great on xg so far hes at 02 xg per 90 so thats eigh of all mids under 57 so thats not great but he tops the expected assists per 90 so hes got an expected assist rate of 08 per 90 so thats the first of all mids under 57 so collect like collectively hes hes probably one of hes one of the better assets in that 55m bracket and his fixtures a mixed like we said the next two are good for brighton so i think if you were looking to for some short termism against switch and forest that looks like a good route and even that chelsea game and the spurs game afterwards not too bad but its not like plain sailing green greens and grays in the tracker its a little bit mixed hes probably worth targeting for the next two but hes hes gna get taken off early most games and we have seen that he has been like ainger is too good to just stay on the bench for 90s so but hes hes great as well so but hes but hed been a long way away like africa for his internationals and so see how he comes back as guess i l looked it up he finished his he finished his international break like on monday he played his last game so i think he might be back or back already so i think hes hes definitely an interesting hes probably not like the best option from brighton but hes because a dring is there but he showed like he could be a good option this year yep okay so another one i wanted to mention is son hes 10m 991 owned so hes hes a good differential at the moment this arsenal fixture looks tough on paper but at the same time like weve mentioned rice and odard being out like this is probably the time if youre gonna go there on wild card and stuff like i think hes a great pick and then i think the fixtures for him like attacking wise i think that they suit his player style of fast countering attack countering against team teams that should attack them at the same time so like brenford man united brighton west ham palace villa those all seem like games that are suited for him to get goals on the on the on the counterattack so i think hes been absolutely overlooked on wild cards because he is expensive and people are looking at palmer but like those fixtures to me i can absolutely see him possibly outscoring palmer over that lot brenford they all sound good honestly like so hes got a good record as ive mentioned as well in north l derby so i dont think this week is that big of a reason to not pick him as well so we also like its a shame that doms been injured we dont know if hes gonna come straight back in and what that situation is gonna look like but i dont think that should put us off him as much either because like like palmer hes got big in him so tottenhams xg of 48 eight which is seventh as i said like 127 xg from himself which is eighth of all mids two big chances five key passes two big chances created so hes looking like hes good on both sides of the ball of assists and attacking potential so assumingly hell be on penalties we dont know for sure but as of right now he probably is so i think hes a great pick i like sun and i have like already early season regret because as one of my well i had done in a lot of my drafts in preseason then in like the last week i got turned onto this salanki and bruno idea rather than sun and pedro and thats like set me back some points but hes hes hes been good and im sure hell continue to be good but like we talked about a bit earlier as well he is going to be some impact with salanki coming back maybe that makes salanki a good pick for less a bit like havit and sack at the minute so it could but at the same time we dont know if slank is back true so far we dont we and just probably is usually quite good on telling telling us when hes gonna be back so well see and just mentioned have thing quickly so hes another one to mention for wild carding again like we mentioned i dont think this north l derby game is one to be worried about because i expect its going to be quite open but hes offering a better points per million than sacka so far this season its a small sample size but its not much to separate the two of them considering as a 19m gap so hes outperformed sacka for xg so far 15 to 1 three this is per game i should say expected assists hes hes nowhere near though expected assist of just 01 per game to sackers 06 but his expected points is similar 148 to 16 so its relatively close and in game week six when the arsenals fix just turn and they played two of the promoted sides back toback at home in leicester and southampton and then bournemouth i think hell pretty much guarantee but being my team and then three game weeks proof of what theyre like together could set the that set the tone for who to hold for the longer term well isac to hav game six that sounds fantastic as well i think he does and i think having not having sacker in your team does allow you to have sun instead and theres going to be the parallels do you have sacker and salanki or havs and i think youd want double up on attack right definitely for those three games but im thinking that longer term after that theres a theres a reason to have like only one arsenal attacker as your coverage and if its if it looks if havitz is performing better than lets say jackson and sank it gives you more impetus to have like the another attacker from chelsea or spurs in your midfield yep fair okay just add do you want to mention anything else no thats fine on that ill just mention very quickly as going a little bit over time but dunk 45m 67 owned i dont you see a reason why you wouldnt just put him on your wild card like the next two sound fantastic theyve kept one clean sheet so far at a three like they look better defensively these ipwi and not in forest at home is great chelsea and top them after that not great but you can bench him then newcastle wolves okay you can play him liverpool man city after that not great but 12 onwards again bourma southampton fulham leicester crystal palace west united brenford like that run is great so if youre looking for a cheap defender like i think just stick him there you can just bench him with someone so always worth a shot on goal as well like even own goal so be aware of that but at the same time like next two looks so good like if switch have 121 xg of over three games which is 20 in the league wow so by far the worst xg so like that looks like it should be a nailed on clean sheet at home for bri and then n and forest 478 xg but theyve only scored three goals so that looks like a good cheap clean sheet possibility as well so 39 xgc is eighth of all teams and thats only 02 behind arsenals like elite backline that weve seen over the past season so one shot four key passes one big chance created like lots of fullbacks dont get one big chance created so i like him i think hes gonna be spoilers for my team if im not wild carding ill be getting him in for hall whos in my team the so nice should we talk about our teams then yes lets do it so you im still surprised you say you might steal wild card its just the jotter thing i think is a is a worry just because of you darwin like i dont but like so if j doesnt play but hell probably come off the bench wont he so maybe thats not even that much of an issue if j doesnt start like he can come off the bench against forest and probably do something so thank you so hall two dunk seems likely and then ill ill be benching one of pedro ora and i have no idea who yet and then bailey is now injured apparently for villa so rogers like ive been tempted to just play smith row and just like not double up but at the same time roger x minutes have gone up again with bailey out but bailey out affects their attack probably so and then again if waters watkins is injured then that puts it another bloody fl suppose i i could it will be interesting to see how they manage his minutes because theyve got that champions league game away on the in the week it was just like a small hes been playing the games hes been going off early hes had two weeks rest like surely absolutely fine surely like i expect probably play like 60 70 minutes though again maybe durans been good but like watkins is their star like theres no way hes getting benched randomly if hes not injured so and isak i still think is hes talked about people owning him and selling him in fpl asnt he and hes hes ready for a brace as he says so happy to own isach still i think this is a great fixure for him walls have been conceding for fun so like that so i will have cover if i make that move for hall to dunk for whatever happens just im gonna have to a z in the northland derby with pedro clean sheet that be nice but you have play youd have to play mate anyway what would like flip you into wanting to wild card because the team looks okay if you heard what watkins and y were out that and sck scks okay sck would be fine like so if j if nunas is said to be getting the nod then that would affect things as i said like jot on off the bench is probably not that bad but if watkins is injured those two would be a big thing no i think i think it and i think dunk is probably i could get muno for palace against leicester at home that seems good but say i dont want double up of pal defense so and hes point five more expensive and ive got one in the bank and i just want to just keep that change there no i agree i agree no i think the team looks good for this week i think if i think if everton is the villa fixer evons the one which is going to make it just because of the two of them there i put my team on twitter and saying like this looks like an obvious wild card right and then and most people were just like youre an idiot okay fair enough i think absolutely not i wouldnt dont think you need a wild card i it looks good for this week to be honest but as soon as if you do get dunk playing him i think that just adds that extra layer to who would you play out of porro and id probably play porro probably and then youd play smith instead of rogers probably because smith thr surely hes had two weeks off hes had no international duty just hes surely he can play night now you would think so you would think so and i think that fixture is good is dont id probably play id back the home fixture for porro and the slightly greater attacking output from open play and then i would probably play smith row over rogers but its close its close it is people saying roger is gonna be a pen hes like no i dont know about that i think its be tans isnt it it is tons simply put and then its mcin after that and then maybe watkins not rogers there not rogers now i dont think so be good if it was right lets have a quick look here is that all lovely so youre so youre only going to take a one transfer at most arent you not no hits this week minus 12 you nice just the one i think b hard otherwise nothing so my team is henderson in goal cba robinson and coner at the back and i heard that coner got injured last night which is a bit irritating because hes been like my nice sleeper defender on the bench for these two fixtures i i put a tweet out about that seeing asking whats happened to him and no responses so i dont know well he went off and then its apparently it sounded bad but then afterwards carley said he looked okay to me but i havent spoken to him so who knows im going to be waiting until that but anyway im going to play him and if he doesnt play then porro is going to come on got bruno still hes such a difficult one this week because south hampton looks like a juicy fixture of hoans back he returned for portugal so well hes always returning for bloody portugal and not nfpl and i got as a smith row sacka munis isach and harand so at the moment this week i think im hoping that hes good this week so im looking at maybe doing one of two things im either conservative and i just do celba to trent with my one free transfer just so im on a liverpool a little bit and i keep sacka and i keep bruno or i take a minus four and do cba sacka and bruno to trent salah and minty thats my other option i think okay so you got two free transfers got two free transfers so i think i think sacka i think salahs going to outscore sacka this week i think bruno could outscore minty for even though he hasnt so far this season i think this is the game he probably could but im confident trent will so i just dont know if its worth a full fourpoint hit but then i like to be on that ahead of next game week where i probably will captain salah so and just bruno hasnt lived up to his price in the first three games or united havent their attacking numbers arent good i fancy a little bit of those brighton games even though mins a bit of a 70 to 80 minute person he has returned so dont know what do you think about that i like the bruno f so theres that so maybe just the sle move but at the same time like salah and m and trent those all sound good too so the other option is which is was it at the start of the week but thats leso now is isach to pedro saka to salah cba to trent these are for minus four next im using is to pedro saka to salah and ca to trent but i the only reason i would probably favor the bruno move is because i think isaks probably more likely to score points in the next two than bruno is i still just dont know if i trust him enough and so thats what not note to both of us stop picking brun i know stupid stupid when did you get rid of him who did you get rid of him for i got rogers ands it that was it that was last week it was it was bruno and chitson to watkins and rogers so i feel like that i definitely want some liverpool players this week and ca is an easy transfer out because i can do that anyway so i can just get trent for him thats and thats a massive upgrade this and next week and then its just a question of whether i fancy saka to do well against spurs and bruno to do anything against southampton or just play it safe and get salah and minty who probably will outscore them both this week and next as well so just im probably going to do the minus four and then just leave the team as is until game ex wild card so well see cool all right does that wrap us up i think so we did a long show tonight yep its because were excited to be playing fb again arent we were were back thankfully right well hope for good weekends and have we got anything else to add final thoughts holland to break his leg all right thats what a nice note to end on what a lovely sa all right well lets hope that doesnt happen and lets hope they both score the same amount of points this game week how about that the just same amount of points for the whole season lovely all right well thanks everyone for watching and well well catch you next week unless is another international break bye everyone good luck everyone have a,12090
1,TheArmbandFPL,GUVhMwx6oMI,FPL GW4 PREVIEW ｜ WC PICKS ｜ FPL ARMBAND,2024-09-11T18:29:52Z,against Leicester so I was just like that's why would I play Pedro really but you know is what it is um yeah 74 R 1.3 million um I've never really been this low at the start of the season so before so um Uncharted Terr for me and hopefully I could just start to yeah get back up there CU you had a good game we game week one I think it's it's probably like a little bit of layer from people using triple captain in game week one and I always think like the ranks are always bench Beast as well yeah yeah I always think ranks are a little bit BL at the start of the season because some players will yeah play like newer players or not newer players but people who aren't taking it seriously will wild card and yeah you're right bench boost I mean in my for instance my work mini league who is full of people or some people that don't take it as seriously as perhaps we might like chips have been thrown down Gams one two and three with triple captains and bench boost so I'm putting some of it down to that as well so let's roll with roll with that um all right um what what happened to me I had another Harland hatrick which was lovely but then Salah just he bit back again which I was bit disappointed about I didn't did I make any moves I don't think I did I think I rolled the transfer um I contemplate didn't I getting rid of Bruno for buo which would have been really nice didn't go for it in the end and you know that's quite a lot of Miss points but my the transfers will come in handy this week I think I got 77 harand Captain c e got 10 um that was about it really didn't have any clean sheets but Robinson got an assist and isack obviously got some points it was pretty bar really yeah those two are the big difference I think a and Robinson yeah yeah absolutely so yeah it was um a close game weekend I had a green AR but it's nothing nothing too exciting 2.2 million let's see where we are after like game week 10 or 12 when we're like a third of the way through the season and um yeah for in the millions then we can start panicking yeah exactly right let's let's talk a little bit about this upcoming game week there's been a load of talk I think about wild card being played I nearly did it you've been talking about it a lot are you still nearly done it a few times as well I'm still undecided to be honest but yeah I just think it seems really early I think like you're right in previous Seasons we would have thought about wild carding in the first International break because it's only three game weeks this season that almost feels too early as as well uh to be honest there been huge market movement like if I look at the front page of the Premier leue uh FPL site Pedro Diaz Harland Salah all like the top transfers in obviously Anana is in there as well from Villa and then people are like transferring out you know some good players isak's gone Watkins sacka gardial Palmer I think it's three weeks is Palmer like what I know I know he's been draining I know it's crazy yeah but I I think that yeah to make it a wild card at the moment the reason I've probably gone and not done it is because I haven't found a wild card draft that I feel comfortable with I feel like I still don't know enough about each of the players is and yeah the same I think I've um yeah I've tried to put things together and I've just not I've been like maybe like .5 short of like a good team that I like and it's just like so at that point I would have to do a significant downgrade to someone basically where I'm just not really not wanting to do that but at the same time um hopefully in a few weeks like cheaper assets will come forward because like I'm going to start being priced out of the players that on on this sort of wild card I won't be able to get them because I'll be rising up in prices and things so you know um I got to Hope Watkins comes back this week and stuff like that and yeah hopefully I can see him training soon because he's a worry because if he's out then I'm gonna have to Wild Card for sure because because that's another player and jotter who knows what's happening with him uh just because um Darwin's not gone on International break he's been training two weeks of slot yeah um so there's that worry as well might play and then obviously all the um yeah do I want Arsenal players anymore considering all the the um the other issues so yeah what do you I mean this is a bit more of a a wider point you were you were quite like firm at the start of the season and still now that you didn't really think Harlem was was good value and I think a lot of wild cards been played to double up on well just get both harand and Salah do you still think even if you had the wild card to play now and when you play it in the future do you still think you're more minded to have one rather than the other uh yeah I think I would probably still not have harand when I've been looking at drafts I've not been including harand um yeah I think that's that's probably like reflective of good pricing there's probably times this season where we want both but yeah I feel the same when when I'm looking at the the teams I can do and I see drafts on on Twitter I think a team with both of them in just seems like so bloated for two assets and the rest of the team around it at the moment are filled with like picks we don't know are going to be good even even so even with only just Salah I'm still looking at a drafts where it's like I've got two five million midfielders in there it's just like yeah it's just just because I'm trying to spend I've been looking at Sun I've been looking at Watkins Watkins um Pedro and isak still like I I want to keep isak still I still want to keep so it was expensive forward line as well so um but yeah Sun Sun would probably have to go in that scenario unfortunately but yeah I like some we'll talk about him later but yeah well should we talk about some matches from this weekend and get excited about that and then perhaps wrap up at the end by talking about like picks we like for the for wild card yep cool do you want to do you want to kick off with the Tottenham and Arsenal game yeah sure so yeah so obviously nor lad and derby um I think it's the last game of the week on the Sunday night isn't it yeah might be yeah let's have a look uh fine um yeah last six results um in the Premier League um Spurs have had four losses one win one draw they scored nine goals um Arsenal one loss four wins one draw obviously yeah the opposite 13 goals scored um for wise over the first three fixtures uh Spurs yeah surprisingly XG of 4.88 which is uh which they've scored six goals which is seventh overall for teams and then an XGC of 3.6 the three conceded which is sixth best but that's actually better than Arsenal's XGC and better than the Arsenal's XG which is 4.48 and Arsenal's XGC is 3.7 so um yeah like Spurs are beating Arsenal in the sort of attacking and defensive metrics in the data yeah um obviously by the amount conceded um you know Arsenal conceded what is it like one and Spurs seon three but still like number wise analytic wise Spurs are in better form to be honest so interesting um yeah so um rice is obviously banned for this one um which is a bit of concern um I think it's an offensive concern as well with his quality perent pieces his link up play as well um and yeah not being available in those sort of phases of um attacking seems to be is going to be an issue I think um but at the same time they can probably play havit back there they can push him back um into sort of a pivot with parte and maybe I guess georgino possibly yeah um so I don't think like the quality is that much of a drop off obviously odard is also a bit of an issue as well um he's like unofficially been sort of um saying he's going to be out for about three weeks yeah I heard that too um yeah so maybe not the end of the world but possibly the end of the world in terms of maybe even this early in terms of the title race if they lose to Spurs and city in the next two they're gonna be quite a bit behind already so yeah I think it's a really bad time for them to lose you're right like three weeks now there's like two such important away fixtures which probably two of their the most difficult are going to be this season because Spurs are always up for the north London Derby and yeah City are going to want to put one over on them start of the season of course um so yeah just um sack's record versus SPS in the last six um in the Premier League so he's scored three goals and two assists which is obviously pretty good um and then Suns record versus Arsenal in the last six is five goals so that's pretty good too um yeah both main attackers from each team have good history form in this fixture um so I would say most likely outcome is both teams to score so I think in my position I've got a sber and parro in my team I'll be looking to start only one of them and it's really not clear which one is going to be the best to be honest because Spurs are at home the data would say spur porro is better because he's he's quite attacking as well but then at the same time like Spurs definitely gonna concede and is he gonna do anything attacking wise like who knows because their defense isn't massively changed like they're still front they're back for is still the same R is still there like I George is going to protect as hopefully with party as well like both of them will do the job re rice does so I don't think it's GNA be too bad defensively so at the moment I'm leaning towards sber Stein but at the same time like I don't feel comfortable about it so um and porro is maybe more fun yeah um yeah I don't know like it's it's hard it's it's really hard like I 50/50 maybe back the home team but Arsenal U the elite defense I suppose I me not this season so far but um yeah they have only conceded one and they kept two clean sheets out of three so um but yeah I think all attackers are worth playing here like havit sun sacka they all seem like good picks if slank's back could do fine but you know he's probably a worse pick than someone like sun I think in this because I think he's probably going to get marked out the game by sber or Gabrielle so um yeah and I mean obviously the the big thing is probably Havoc people were looking at him on wild card and stuff like that and I've I've been saying he's like such a good asset which I still think he is but like if he's going to start to play in the Midfield three um over the next two that's obviously going to Dent his appeal a bit um I think it's a it's a good thing he's going to play like or you know from our selfish FPL point of view because I don't think many people will be investing in Arsenal assets like now game we four and game week five but Wild Card 6 which looks like a prime window and Arsenal got three good fixtures is then like if he is sort of if OD guard's back in and havit is back up front by then it you know there's no F missing out of his points and hopefully he remains still a bit of a sleeper pick because yeah I'm bit on him later but his my points per million value at the moment is is far better than sacker and he's nearly matched him for points so far this season and yeah I think he's you know there's a there's a case for having havocs only from game week six onwards to free up money in your midfields you don't necessarily need sacka but yeah I yeah I agree with you about Arsenal this weekend I think taking two of their main three midfielders let's say out of the side is going to have you know it's GNA have a big impact there's no question about that and the backups aren't as good yeah I I was watching a bit of planet fbl um and they they got um a guy called Clayton on there and he's an Arsenal fan and he's just he was just saying that like he doesn't think it's going to be that much of an issue I think they're they're good enough their team and the squad is good enough to like beat sort of ter a bad spur well they're not bad spur side but I still think they're like good enough quality to still beat them yeah um and I think the players coming in is it's more of a system rather than straight light for like sort of players and and and those those players can come in and do a job like georgino I think it was last year when he started playing games like he was really good like he was he was not a weak Link at all so um yeah we we'll see I guess but um yeah I think the attackers could I still think sacka like obviously odard is the one that's usually linking up with him but I think he he'll probably get more space on that side now because he's he's going to have less um sort of people occupying his Zone I guess and S SAA did well in this fixture last season remember he had like a goal and assist perhaps and I think hit's had the same so I think you're right it's going to be an open game and I'm think it you know not wouldn't be surprised if sacker and habits both return again this this game week and and return well I I still like it from saaka like a lot of people are looking at saaka to Salah and stuff like that to get Salah in people have just just Harland and and I obviously see that but I can see saki getting something in this for sure absolutely all right should we move on chat a little bit about Liverpool and and Forest it' be good to hear your thoughts I noticed Jammer in the the chat um sorry about the typing mentioned um that he was looking to move away from Liverpool assets in in game week six and you know I think it's it's interesting I just they've got such good over the the next two and they've shown such great promise in the start of the Season it seems um yeah surprising to to hear that yeah Wolves Away Crystal Palace away and then Chelsea home after six like those two are definitely still good like I think I watched a bit of Raptor's video as well saying that like if you wild card in seven or eight you can keep those Liverpool players those two fixtures longer those good two away fixtures um whereas the other people are probably moving off them and you've got a Salah against wolves and and Palace who look really bad defensively so yeah well I think just speaking about yeah this game specifically in terms of projected goals and clean sheet odds Liverpool coming 2.8 um expected goals this this game week 46% chance of the clean sheet that's only very slightly behind City this this game week forest with a expected goal rate of .7 6% clean sheet rate so you know the odds are are favoring a a big Liverpool win and here on like I'm not surprised Salah had you know he's played some minutes over the International International break but I think he's going to be you know obviously fine coming back into the into the team and you know interesting topic that we talk about every week is how well he's he's going to keep Pace with Harland or how well harland's going to keep Pace with with Salah this season and that's going to be like the I think the main Crux of all like talking point all season long five big chances so far this season that's that's second overall he's had um he's had four big chances created which is first so I think the difference between hland and uh harand and Salah so far this season is salah's creativity harand hasn't really got that so if his if his goals drop off salah's getting the sort of the points from creative Outlets as as well and I think in in this game he's got another good chance to yeah to score well and I'd be interested to see considering their similar matchups who people who uh if people own both Salah and Harland who they're most likely going to Captain and perhaps people in the comments or in the chat whove got both can can tell us um yeah 141 and 17 in the last three so I imagine for you he's going to be nailed on Captain this week um yeah I think so um there's yeah Watkins with a good fixture um obviously Watkins bit of an issue but I think um Isaac could be a good fixture too um and then yeah I think that's probably maybe even Pedro I mean obviously that seems stupid but um just because of his like price point but that it's home fixture that's that's GC is good it's good I want to get get your thoughts on Diaz right because he's he's predicted to maybe rise in price like point2 over this International break I was like really considering on that Sunday Sunday night but it was like that postmatch thing of like oh man I want that player that's that's done well but it's a small sample size so far this season in three games which is you know again one of the reasons why ien played the the wild card and what we're seeing in these first three game weeks I don't know if it's like a purple pack rather or Purple Patch rather than like it's it's a indication of what his season long form is so I had to look at what is I appreciate it's under different managers but he's provide an attack and return this season every 56 minutes last season it was every 175 minutes so that comes down to two things has he got that much better over the summer or is he playing in a side that suits him better and gives him more licensed to to do things and then if you look even more at his numbers so 0.76 XG per 90 so far this season against 0.41 uh XG per9 last season so he's roughly nearly doubled his expected goal output so far the season and I think that's why it's so difficult to make like cut and dry decisions on on these type of players who are I don't know who haven't been like big FPL heroes in the in the past I think he's he's really popular now but I'm not sure if it's yeah if it's going to last what where do you sit on or where do you come on down on that uh yeah I think um you're probably right in like he probably has got better the system probably does suit him a bit more um but at the same time like that is probably a little bit unsustainable um I think he's just been fortunate to get on the the back of some of the things and um you know the ball for the his second against United I think just like happened to land in the spot where he just rifled at home first time like maybe that's good for him where he was just being in that position but at the same time like he's like I don't know a yard the other way or something he doesn't he doesn't get that chance so um yeah like he's a good pick like obviously is but like he's coming back GL from South America just as someone like Pedro like nobody thinks that that's really gonna be an issue but um you know Gat Go's been playing in in Europe and Darwin's not played at all like gapco probably deserves some time like the but you know slot hasn't rotated anyone so far I think apart from quansa um so is he just yeah so is he just gonna keep playing his first first um maybe 11 until he he doesn't need to I guess like and it's the start of the champions league isn't it so we've got like we're coming back from the international break into like another three games in a week spell so I'm sure there will be rotation like he's already not played Diaz for full s in two of the opening three games I mean you're obviously paying a lot more for Salah but you're getting those 90s I was sort of coming around to the main question like for people who don't have a Salah team and for people who are maybe going to walk Hard Salah out in a few game weeks is Diaz like a good enough cover but I think probably the answer to that is going to come with more more data and more knowledge of how he how he plays in this system like we've got three games to to judge and one of those he's he's blanked in and iway I just think it's interesting cuz he's near up to nearly 177% now up to near preseason and kungu levels of ownership and yeah I just it's just interesting he player I looked at but I'm just not not quite so sure on him I think um I think he'll probably do the thing where like his front three he plays his first 11 and then he just takes off Diaz jotter probably around the sort of 60 Mark and then J off salar off maybe around the 80 I could see that happening and then so that those three maybe Trent again as well like the the ones that he really needs to be fit constantly um just take them off a bit earlier see happen I mean I've been so lucky with Trent I mean I'm just going to mention him briefly but like it's criminal that I ever looked him in you know I went off last season's forming that Liverpool were not great defensively last season they had eight clean sheets All Season didn't think they were going to make much of a difference they've got like three already so nearly half of that total after three game weeks and Trent has been so unlucky not to return big as well like that disallowed goal against United should have had a an assist for y in the brenford game I think it was and in the IP switch game so yeah I he's like on my definite bring in list this game week and yeah I can't sit through another pool game no like uh knowing that I could be on the end of a a beating basically but yeah he's been a beast and he was really good for England got the assist last night for Kane um yeah I just think he looks good sh and then just quickly on Forest defense L before we move on they're actually you know I was quite surprised so the projected goals and clean sheet odds obviously heavily in aable favor but they have been you know decent defensively so far the season they've not played the same caliber of opponent but they're third best for expected goals conceded after after three games um Liverpool on 2.1 expected gos conceded Forest 2.5 I think it's city is the other team in that mix they've conceded five big chances which is the same as Liverpool and you know like I say they've had good fixtures we knew that but theyve they've still performed and done well so I think it will be a I think it will be a tighter game than the Man United game and maybe the most defensive team Liverpool have played so far I think that um I think that minkovich has made a difference he is he he is a solid and good Defender but I I feel like that their numbers will certainly start to drop off with them with um playing better teams obviously I think Liverpool should get like a two-nil win that's seems fine to me will Forest score do you see that I don't think so I don't I think that they've only they've had like the really good fixtures at the start of this season and they've only they only scored two in or is it three in three games I think wood scored two and more Gibs white scored the other one yeah maybe so yeah they've had like good fixtures and yeah they've not like scored multiple so I think they' be surprised if they even score one I'm just checking it was one one I think it was 1 one one nil and 111 wasn't it yeah so yeah they they've not blown teams away yeah and a lot of people are looking at um double defense for Liverpool and wild card um which I I understand from the three games but yeah at the same time they've faced not very good opposite opposition as well so obviously man united you probably wouldn't expect a clean sheet but you know they're still capable so um are they going to be like back to being good like defensively he remains to be seen but I I think double up feels a little bit Rich yeah so also Robinson is pretty attacking so I think Robertson has looked like again he's looked really good and he's on some set pieces he's slightly less expensive than um Trent but like I he's like a million cheaper but I don't know if I'd have Robertson over Trent I'd only have it as like a a double and then and then you're right I don't know if I trust the a double enough um but yeah Allison in goal has actually scored more point so far this season than Trent but despite that I still don't think I'd double up with a Defender and a a goalkeeper from Liverpool yeah Fair um okay so for versus Chelsea next one I've decided to look at um yeah so Chelsea form wise um zero clean sheets so far five conceded um an XGC of 3.2 which is actually weirdly fourth best which I I didn't see coming um so their defense is looking pretty good I guess like considering they played man city as as well um yeah 37 shots for them which is mid-table of all teams um 11 big chances which is third of all teams and nextt year 5.08 which is six and then seven goals scored um but you know they scored six of them in that one game yeah um so um maybe slightly inflated there as well um yeah Bournemouth wise um their XG of 5.99 which is third of all teams which is uh great for bourma um yeah 10 big chances sixth overall five goals scored XGC of 4.7 is 13th worst um zero clean sheets and they've conceded four um so yeah defense is not looking good probably looks good for Palmer returns Jackson returns things like that um yes seeno he seems to be the sort of um hot pick at the moment um 5.6 million he's already risen once only 5% owned when I made these notes it's probably gone up um since then um yeah not blanked yet eight five and six for a player from B pretty good 19 points in three games um so he's obviously he's excellent considering his team I guess um but perhaps inflated by their fical difficulty um of the first three of not Forest away Newcastle at home which obviously Newcastle away seemed to be worse and then Everton away like those fixtures not too bad um so yeah maybe that's been inflated um but then the fixtures from now on are pretty mixed so people are starting to bring them in but their fixtures are are you know rough so chelse at home this week um you know that could be a competitive game he still could still get returns Liverpool way after that Southampton home Obviously good Leicester away is good Obviously good um Arsenal at home yeah tough Aston ver away and then Man City home after that so that's a really tough run that eight to 10 yeah he I mean he is 5.6 million you can bench him you could probably sell him for someone back to like a Smith r or something like that um so like yeah his his price and his value seems to be good like those fixtures after Chelsea and Liverpool those two in the middle there are great so you know I think he's probably a fine pickup but um yeah so 17 shots puts in first for all players although that didn't include um Holland in the stats for some reason it just Holland just wasn't showing up um don't know why ask ask FF Hub why that was happening but he's there now but you think he's second to him so okay fair enough um yeah so he's had two big chances XG of 1.19 key passes of four big chance is created of two and exit of 1.3 so I don't think his numbers look that amazing he's only had one bonus despite returning in all three games I was surprised about that as well I thought he would have ho some bonus as well yeah absolutely saying um so I don't think um his returns are sustainable basically is what I'm trying to say um but then again that at 5.5 million um who's not risen yet tavanir who's played pretty much the same minutes he's only played six few minutes he's at .3% owned his XG is actually beating menos or 2.1 versus 1.2 and their expected points tavers is actually higher um on 20 versus 17 so um you know he's had one goal versus San's two goals one assist but at the same time like you know there's a player who's got more XG maybe maybe that's just saying that like Sanu has been a little bit fortunate to get these returns whereas others haven't got them I guess and he's still at 5.5 you don't you can sa that 0.1 as well he might be might be good for that yeah I mean and he's playing he's fit he's he's usually a talent man for that bom of team so his expected points rate is higher than SOS after the thir game wees as well so exactly that's which which does surprise me actually considering considering the returns so yeah um I'm not saying pick him or anything it's just a matchup Focus wise like tavanir could be someone uh who does well in this one as well yeah I like it I like it I kind of fancy bour up to win this game to be honest like they their expected goals you're right probably slightly higher because Chelsea have played City but you know they're still they're still decent I mean Chelsea padded those numbers by scoring six against wolves so no I think this is going to be quite an open game and I wouldn't be surprised to see cenia continue his run and what I quite like about bouth now even though they like clawed it back late against everon so you can't really say that was like a good performance I think they're still trying to like work out how their team is uh plays without salanki and it seems like they've got lots of inexpensive players who were sort of chipping into to make the goals happen so maybe that's not great from an FPL point of view because it's a bit of a spread but it does mean there are some you know some a lot of options potentially I think that Evan nson like I said is is a quality player as well once he just settles down um and starts to you know start hitting some goals he might be on penalties as well because he they'll probably want to give it to him to start game scoring goals so um yeah he he'll he's six million he's going to be a good route when they have a good run of fixtures um yeah it's because you know the sort of Striker picks are limited aren't they and and he's going to be a decent option yeah I I'll talk about Palmer eventually when we talk about wild card picks that's why I've not mentioned him yet cool I mean from 11 to n to 20 I was just having a look on the ticker they basically got like a green or gray fixture run according to fpl the only like gray marked games they've got a Spurs at home which they can score in man united away which they absolutely can score in and full them away so yeah they a really good run of games from game week 11 so yeah I like the look of them right let's oh sorry they're cheap as well so it's going to be easy to get on to them yeah exactly yeah um let's just quickly talk about um city and brenford then um so projected goals and clean sheet odds like I mentioned against uh for po I wanted to just compare the two of them um Man City slightly higher predicted goals this game week 2.9 to Liverpool or 2.95 to Liverpool's 2.8 exactly strange because Liverpool's X year is higher than City I yeah I thought the same too and I think it's just based on last season odds as well but 46% chance for clean sheet is the same as Liverpool Forest have sorry brenford again almost the same in terms of um projected goals .76 and a 5% clean sheet Al I don't know why the returns don't quite marry up but yeah so they're bookies are expecting Man City to score slightly Higher Goals but you know negligible as Bren considering against City recently I think they've been quite good against city as well and like yeah last season in um I think it was the double game week when we all triple Captain Harland they played brenford at home and harand just got a single goal in that game and he struggled again in a way game against brenford I think that was one of the first games after he came back from injury when foden got a hat-trick but um yeah he hasn't been he hasn't been great against brenford in previous seasons and the season before that they beat them at they had here had so yeah but he's been in great form this season 2.3 I love that this season yeah exactly yeah 2.3 big per average um per game this season 1.2 XG average per game so I think the main question is how much can he keep this up or what can he keep up so far this season because his price has gone up now so 15.2 for him for anyone that's getting on is you know it's quite a big jum didn't take much for to go up in price and his ownership just too bad about ha yeah yeah true 67% ownership now I think he was like 50 when the season started so we've had a lot of converts I just looking at I think the main reason you're going to have to own harand is because you want to cap in every every week I don't think you can really own him and not think about captaining every week so I was having a look at the the fixes you got coming up so brenford Arsenal um and Newcastle and next three games I I kind of think you can Captain him in the brenford game and you can probably now Captain him in the Arsenal game without rice and potentially odard there I think that makes it more of like a must-win game for for City and the Newcastle game they haven't been like great defensively so I think you know fine but if you're looking for Alternatives in the Arsenal game salah's obviously got a plum fixure that game week Sun's got a good game during that um game week and then 7 to 12 I was looking at these fixtures thinking there's no reason I wouldn't want to Captain him in all of these games Fulham at home Wolves Away Southampton at home is obviously the next juicy one for people talking about triple Captain Bournemouth away Brighton away is maybe the the most tricky one and then Tottenham at home so I think it's at the moment like for me I like it's difficult because I like the salad drafts more at the moment but I think the fomo of not having Haren Captain is almost is too great and that but yeah and and I also don't like the double up like I say because of the the weaker team so it and I think as soon as one of them has like a blank this season there's going to be so much transfer activity of being like Oh my God Sal's bled we've got to take him out and get Harland or oh my God harland's not worth 15.2 and that will absolutely happen there'll be so many transfers either way w't there uh yeah I feel like it's G one of them is gonna blank this week I feel like it's the week that one of them it's more likely to be Sal do you think oh I was gonna sayland but I think that's that's what's great so far about this season because you can either try try both in in a team and like have cheaper players around it which Jammer in the chat earlier said he's done with with good success because he's doing better than both of us at the moment but I I don't know I don't like living with the the fomo anyway it's it's really interesting he's obviously playing out of his skin so far this season and seven goals in in three games just apparently put up an absolute St like one of the worst performan he's ever had apparently in the Norway first game against kazakstan finished nil nil and it's just like odard and Harland in that game and it's nil nil against Kazakhstan it's like I saw some reporter put up just like some absolute just SLO Fest at Holland the worst game he's ever seen him play and he was just utterly awful so that's kind of funny but yeah yeah it's yeah he he can have like the very odd bad game like that game against Arsenal last season at home was poor and that's probably one of the reasons why I want to bring in s in the next two game weeks just to cover that Arenal game where I'm not sure don't even think it's that odd that he has badame like gotam games where he just disappears and he just doesn't make any but like what's been the difference so far this season is like he's still not getting the touches but he's just getting the one touch to to finish some of his finishes were just crazy that's second goal against West Ham he just like touched it and then oh belted it in and even the third one thinking like how is he how had the defense given him so much time as well he just had so much time to just take a touch and just launch it yeah but even as zip finishes against zip which apart from obviously the penalty were were pretty good as as well so I thought kilman would do a number on him you know but no it didn't happen didn't it's down to Nathan Collins this week come on Collins lad oh know no I'm loving it at the moment I think it's I think it's it's great that we've got like the diverse Captain picks but you I feel like as soon as yeah one of them blanks is going to be Mass hysteria and panic and I'm all for that I'm scared um what else I got to say about this one yeah just I think that's was pretty much it really on um the only other player on city is worth talking about is is Lewis like he's gone up to to 4.7 now um 14 points in his first three games a six a two and a a six that's just you know despite the fact they've lost two clean sheets he's got an attacking return he hit the crossbar in that IP switch game per personally he's kind of like not for me because he falls into that category of Man City Defender which has notoriously been apart from probably Canelo and gardial at the end of last season is always a bit of rotation risk but he's played 3 90 minutes so far this season and maybe he's taking that spot from Walker a is now injured so yeah I was gonna say like a is now injured so like people seem to think that's gonna help V which sure it will but like at the same time we saw Lewis play left back for England last night yeah so like he can play left back as well I just think it it makes his exms go up as well if not more so yeah Walker could play and then Lewis could play on the left like give guardio a game off like yeah that could happen but at the same time like Lewis you know he's playing all the games so maybe he needs a game off you know so um I think if you're on wild card and you can afford like he is just 4.7 million and you can rotate him or whatever and you can or if you play him you can afford for whoever comes on to do you know is a decent sort of sub or whatever then he probably is a really good pick yeah well at the same time think he probably will get minutes off the bench over if he does AG yeah so there's there's that it will be frustrating I'm just having a look at that they actually haven't got that many defenders in in FPL they've only got seven one of them Z who's you know probably injured now for some length of time it sounded like it was quite bad stones and Walker have barely played probably because he's a bit like foden he's bringing him back up to speed slowly because they all last night though so did he play full 90 uh I think so I don't know but um yeah so I assume he's fit now yeah well anyway it' just be interesting to see how again I wouldn't want to take a pun on him this early because I'm so conservative but and also I don't think I don't think City are that reliable for for clean or as reliable for clean shits even though he's only 4.7 so I don't know what do what do you think he's he's probably not for me he's not my kind of player but I think if he's if he's still starting every game by the time I wild card then I'll I'll I'll be looking at him yeah but now if I was going to do it now um I would probably want that one Maverick pick and then he probably would be it yeah Harry in the chat said pet rouette is about to come into Force anytime now uccl starting yeah for picking and I kind of agree especially when it comes to their their defense in three games next week and the fact that the Arsenal game is at the end of like the Champions League week makes you think there will be some rotation maybe rotation will be in UCL but yeah definitely something to keep an eye on I think um if anyone is looking to sell scker as well um if you're not going to Sal sell or whatever like de bruyne for thef game seems he's played all three 90s he started all three of them um I think that's interesting but he could easily get benched before champions league as well though but um yeah de bruyne seems fun yeah he's he's super low owned as well what is he 11% that's not bad is it yeah 9.6 million and then we've obviously got foden to come back in sometime time yeah who knows when that's going to be though no idea he played 45 minutes against Chelsea and then he disappeared again so yeah maybe maybe time for the yeah the first just had a look at the minutes yeah he played 45 minutes against Chelsea and then he's not played since I don't even remember that nether do I okay fair enough yeah G's played more minutes in the year so yeah I think still too early to make some decisions on City mids um um shall we talk about some Wild Card picks briefly yep and talk about okay so um yeah the guy who I didn't mention in the Chelsea Bournemouth one was obviously Palmer um yeah 10.6 million now 41% owned like the Twitter sphere has not owned in most of the season but yeah 41% is crazy um yeah Bournemouth um away next West Ham away after that Brighton at home not in Forest at home those two in a row seemed really good Liverpool away and then Newcastle at home so yeah those two after that so good but yeah 276 from three games so far five returns from an xgi of of 1.9 Bruno has had um zero returns from an xgi of two 2.0 so um yeah there's there's FPL for you in a nutshell I guess um kind of ridiculous really um so the fixtures to me like like look ins s enticing on paper but I'm less I'm less sure I guess um bouth have looked like pretty competitive So Far West Ham have a good team but obviously like you know they did can see quite a few toand yeah um and then Brighton and Forest no walk no walkovers anymore that's a sure so that those two games should be competitive just because Chelsea are know near as good as they have been so um I I would definitely include on W card for sure like he is a top pick absolutely but I do think the runner is the run is like sort of tougher than it looks on paper like he um so I had to look at sort of his appearances obviously for like in the Premier League and for Chelsea and stuff against these teams so two appearances versus Bournemouth like he's had one assist two appearances versus West Ham he's had one goal uh four appearances versus Brighton so I guess this is probably uh while being part of City team but you one goal against them and then three appearances versus forest and one assist so he has he has had returns against all the next four but they're not you know he's not hauling he's not having massive returns like but the same like 10.6 million for like a goal like every game or a return game that seems fine um well not majorly fine but still passible um yeah what what do you think about it I would absolutely own him on Wild Card yeah I think it I think if I was wild carding this this week and a lot of people wild carded last week to get him in if I was wild carding him this week I would probably have him as well yeah over over sacka and then obviously I think a play would prob not to go with harl I don't think you can probably have like Holland um Salah and and Palmer and a and a decent Squad around that but you know I think obviously he's been blown up by that huge game against wolves like seven the 17 point pointer there but you know he shown last season he's capable of that I think he's I think he's absolutely solid pick and I think what's quite nice about this start of this season is the way they actually priced the midfielders have sort of like returned in line with that like Salah is the most expensive and he's led the way slightly after that Palmer is slightly outscored s and then around just underneath sacka you've got Sun so I think the the pricing is sort of aligned to how they've scored so far and what I said what I said last when we talked about surprises and stuff like I haven't been surprised by these players so yeah yeah I know so yeah no I I think I like Palmer obviously I also like sacka and at the moment what we're find is we can't have more but yeah if I was going to Wild Card this week I would probably have Palmer over sacka and yeah back him to do well he seems to be playing that number 10 10 roll well could have returned more against Palace it looked like quite an open game so yeah there were times in the highlights where he was like he and the Chelsea players were just like running at three people in palace defense and Henderson somehow bailed them out so and obviously he's he's more expensive than the second so it's easy to get back as well absolutely absolutely um yeah sure okay uh well he's probably not that much of a surprise but his ownership is only 8% and that's him in buo so I don't think even if you're on wild card now it's like it's necessarily a bad time to to get him in so I think he's proven his worth already as the fifth highest scoring mid and it's so annoying because we knew he was going to be good he started last season well and had such a great season until he got you know injured and that derailed him a little bit but he's he's proven himself as a good FPL player he you know monopolizes set pieces he's a good finisher and you know he's scored 24 points after three games so far the season I think if you're want a wild card now it's like not a bad time to preamp getting him for his good run I think only this city game is is tricky and then Spurs away I we talked about it the other week I would fancy him to get G to get a return against Spurs away and then after that his and brentford's run is is really nice we talked about before game week six to 12 it's basically all greens and and Grays on the fixture ticker so yeah I think he's as important to his Club as as is to his monopolizes set pieces he obviously gets that extra point those are all things we already know so yeah I'm surprised are you surprised he's still only 8% well I think for people wild carding now is um they they might look at the next two and be like I can probably not go there but even for for me or you that possibly aren't wild carding now like we could look at the next two and be like yeah probably back against that then look at him from six seven on I I just feel like game week five is like the sneaky pick for him I feel like he could he could do really well in that game and yeah wait an extra week why not get on him early but yeah NE the jotter um J to him in game five work yeah nice okay you got any anyone to talk about yeah so Robinson and we did mention him a little bit earlier um yeah three sixes so far no bonus um but yeah only 6.5% owned I think as we said I think you would own him with Trent if you're gonna do it but yeah he absolutely passes the it test at the moment um so I've got a little sort of um American football sort of analogy like Trent feels like he's sort of like the quarterback where Robinson feels like he's like a wide receiver kind of like getting high and wide and sort of providing like like really good goal threat as from a defensive angle so um yeah he passes the ey test he doesn't necessarily pass the sort of um status test where you know he's got five key passes which is third obviously that doesn't necessarily lead to any sort of goals or assists and stuff but yeah .3 XG which is 11th football Defenders Two Shots which is not that High um but you know he's had threatening shots at least XA of .39 big chance is created is zero and one big chance himself so he looks like he's probably going to be getting more attacking goals possibly than assist um so like I said his stats don't jump off the page I guess it's more of a grass pick than analytical pick yeah um yeah 2.2 XGC for Paul is obviously the best defensive numbers in in the Premier League so far with zero goals conceded um if we assume their sort of defense is still going to be good and they can keep clean sheets um the floor for Robertson can now be a clean sheet and he's got much like sort of attacking potential a much higher upside than he he did before because obviously he was um always looking at like you know a base of two Liverpool were conceeding all the time and obviously Trent had more a threat yeah whereas now he's got possibly a base of six which he's he's proved so far in his his three matches and um you know he's he's just like Trent has been unlucky to not get attacking returns so um yeah I I think if you're picking on one card like those two at the back for the next next three or four at least seem seem great to me um it's just yeah I think you absolutely pick Trent and Robinson is just someone you could just pick on the side as just a low upside pick yeah yeah no I like the Robinson pick as well I think if to go with Salah you know he's he's going to be nailed on and like we said earlier I think he's he's got the capability of getting a return because he's on some corners and set pieces as well so I think a lot of it relies on Liverpool's defense being good so yeah we remains to be you see yeah so say same with um Trent as well they've both been sort of been taken off a bit early which is it can be good for Defenders as well so they got um that possibility too um on other wild cpic so again maybe I've done a couple more I think minty is someone who are impressed Us in preseason and there been like okay so far this season without being like great he's been outperformed by Mata Moma but appreciate he's probably not he's not as expensive as that and ainger's done well but you know he's got two returns in in three games a four two and a a four he was the one that had the big chance against Arsenal that um Rey saved and Pedro followed in onto got the assist in that way and in the Everton game we obvious he came off at half time and he got his concussion so there's you know who can say what he would have done in the second half but he would have at least got two more points from that so he's an interesting pick he's he's certainly not as popular as Pedro Welbeck but I think he's pretty well priced mid if you're switching to a 352 he looks more attacking than someone like Smith row who I've had and for all mids under 5.7 he's actually you know fairing not too badly so he's he's not great on XG so far he's at 02 uh XG per 90 so that's eighth of all mids under 5.7 so that's not great but he tops the expected assists um per 90 so he's got an expected assist rate of 0.8 per 90 so that's the first of all mids under 5.7 so yeah collect like collectively he's he's probably one of he's one of the better Assets in that 5.5 million bracket and yeah his his fixtures are mixed like we said the next two are good for for um Brighton I think if you were looking to yeah for some short termism against s and Forest that looks like a good route and even that Chelsea game and the Spurs game afterwards not not too bad but it's not like plain sailing green greens and Grays in the tracker uh it's a little bit mixed yeah he's probably worth um targeting for the next two but he's he's gonna get taken off early most games and we have seen that he has been like ainger is too good to just stay on the bench for 90s so um yeah but he's he's great as well but yeah he's but he been a long long way away like Africa for his Internationals and so see how he comes back as well guess yeah I L looked it up actually he finished his um he finished his International break like on on Monday he played his last game so I think he might be back or yeah back already so yeah I think he's he's definitely an interesting he's probably not like the best option from from Brighton but he's because aing is there but yeah he's he showed like it could be a good option this year yep okay um so another one I wanted to mention is son uh he's obviously 10 million 99.1% owned so he's he's a good differential at the moment um obviously this Arsenal fixture looks tough on paper but at the same time like we've mentioned rice and odard being out like this is probably the time if you're gonna go there on wild card and stuff like I think he's a great pick and and then I think the fixtures for him like attacking wise I think that that they suit his play style of fast sort of countering attack countering against teams that should attack them at the same time so like brenford man united Brighton West Ham Palace Villa those all seem like games that are suited for him to get goals on the on the on the Counterattack yeah so yeah I I think he's been absolutely overlooked on wild cards because obviously he is expensive and people are looking at palmer but like those fixtures to me I can absolutely see him possibly outscoring Palmer over over that lot um yeah brenford yeah they all sound good honestly like um so he's got a good record as I've mentioned as well in North L Derby so I don't think this week is that big of a reason to not pick him as well so um yeah we also kind of like it's a shame that Dom's been injured we don't really know if he's gonna come straight back in and what that sort of situation is gonna look at look like but I don't think that should really put us off him as much either because like you know like Palmer he's got sort of big big [ __ ] in him so um yeah tottenham's XG of 4.88 which is seventh as I said like 1.27 um XG from himself which is eighth of all mids um two big chances five passes two big chances cre so he's looking like he's good on both sides of the ball of assist and attacking potential so assumingly he'll be on penalties we don't know for sure but um yeah as of right now I guess he probably is um so I think he's a great pick yeah I I like sun and I have like already early season regret because as you know one of my oh I had done him in a lot of my drafts in preseason then in like the last week I sort of got turned onto this salanki and Bruno idea rather than son and Pedro and that's like set me back some some points but yeah he's he's he's been good and I'm sure he'll continue to be good but like yeah we talked about a bit earlier as well he's obviously going to be some impact with salanki coming back maybe that makes salanki a good pick for Less a bit like havitz and Sack at the minute so yeah it could but at the same time we don't know if sank is actually back yeah true so so far we don't we we yeah an's probably is usually quite good on telling actually telling us when he's gonna be back so we'll see and just mentioned H hav thing quickly so he's another one to mention for for wild carding again like we mentioned I don't think this Northland Derby game is one to be worried about because I expect it's going to be quite open but he's offering a better points per million than sacka so far this season it's a small sample size but it's not much to separate the two of them um considering as a 1.9 million gap so he's actually outperformed sacka for XG so far 1.5 to uh 1.3 this is per game I should say expected assist he he's nowhere near though expected assist of just 0.1 per game to sackers 0.6 but his expected points is is similar 14.8 to 16 so it's relatively close and in game week six when the Arsenal's fix just turn and they played two of the marides back toback at home in Leicester and Southampton and then Bournemouth I think he'll pretty much guarantee but being my team and then you know three game weeks proof of what they're like together could set the set the tone for who to hold for the longer term well isach to um hav game at six that sounds fantastic as well I think he does and I think having you know not having scker in your team does allow you to have Sun instead and you know there's obviously going to be the parallels do you have sacker and salanki or HS and I think you'd want double double off on attack to right oh yeah oh yeah definitely for those three games but I'm thinking like longer term after that there's a there's a reason to have like only one Arsenal attacker as your coverage and if it's if it looks if havitz is performing better than let's say Jackson and sank it gives you more impetus to have like the another attacker from Chelsea your spurs in your Midfield yep Fair okay um just add do you want to mention anything else no that's fine on that yeah I'll just mention very quickly as going a little bit over time but um dunk uh 4.5 million 6.7% owned I don't you really see a reason why you wouldn't just put them on your wild card like the next two sound fantastic um they've kept one clean sheet so far at a three like they look better defensively these ipwi iwit and not and Forest at home is obviously great Chelsea and top them after that not great but you can bench then Newcastle wolves uh okay you can play him Liverpool Man City after that not great but 12 onwards again Bournemouth Southampton Fulham Leicester Crystal Palace West United brenford like that that run is great so if you're looking for a cheap Defender like I think just stick him there you can just bench him with someone um yeah so always worth a shot on goal as well like even an own goal so be aware of that but at same time like next two looks so good like if switch have 1.21 XG of over three games which is 20 from the league wow so by far the worst um XG so like that looks like it should be a nailed on clean sheet at at home for Bri um and then yeah n Forest a 4.78 XG but they only scored three goals so that looks like a good good cheap clean sheet possibility as well so yeah 3.9 XGC is eighth of all teams and that's only 0.2 behind arsenals like obviously Elite back line that we've seen over the past Seasons so yeah one shot four key passes one big chance created like lots of fullbacks don't get one big chance created so yeah um I like him I think he's going to be um you know spoilers for my team if I'm not wild carding I'll be getting him in for Hall who's in my team at the moment so yeah nice should we talk about our teams then yes let's do it so you me I'm still surprised you say you might still wild wild card uh yeah it's just the the the jotter thing I think is a is a worry just because of um you Darwin like I I don't but like so if J doesn't play but obviously he'll probably come off the bench won't he so maybe that's not even that much of an issue if J doesn't start like he can come off the bench against forest and probably do something so um yeah thank you so um yeah Hall to um dunk seems likely and then I'll I'll be benching one of Pedro or SBA and I have no idea who yet um and then yeah Bailey is now injured apparently for Villa so Rogers like I've been tempted to just play Smith row and just like not double up but at the same time Rogers X minutes have gone up again with bayy out but Bailey out affects their attack probably so yeah um and then again if Waters Watkins is injured then that puts it another Blood I suppose I yeah I suppose I could um it will be interesting to see how they manage his minutes because they've got that Champions League game away on the in the week it was just like a small he's been playing the games yeah he's been going up early he's had two weeks rest like surely absolutely fine yeah surely I expect probably play like 60 70 minutes though again yeah maybe maybe um Duran's been Obviously good but like Watkins is their star like there's no way he's getting benched randomly if he's not injured so um and yeah isak I still think is is you know he's talked about people owning him and selling him in fbl asn't he and he's he's ready for a brace as he says so um yeah happy to own isach still I think this is a great fixure for and walls have been uh conceding for fun um so like that um yeah so I I will have cover if I make that move for Hall to to dunk for whatever happens I guess um just yeah I'm gonna have to a z z in the the Northland derby with Pedro that would be nice but you'd have to play you'd have to play mate anyway what would actually like flip you into wanting to wild card because the team looks okay if you heard Watkins and Y were out yeah yeah that basically and sck oh yeah Sak's yeah okay s would be fine like yeah so if J um yeah if Nuno is is said to be getting the the nod then then that would affect things as I said like joton Off the Bench is probably not that bad but yeah if Watkins is injured oh yeah those two would be a big thing yeah no I think I think yeah and I think dunk is probably I could get Muno for Palace against Lester at home that seems good but say I don't want the double up of Defense so and he's five more expensive and I've got one in the bank and I just want to just keep that that sort of change there no I agree agree no I think the team looks good for this week I think if I think if Everton is the The Villa fixer against Everton's the the one which is going to make it just because of the the two of them there yeah I I put my team on Twitter and saying like this looks like an obvious wild card right and then and most people were just like you're an idiot yeah okay fair enough yeah I kind of think absolutely not I wouldn't don't think you need a wild card I think it looks good for this week to be honest but yeah as soon as if you do get dunk yeah playing him I think that just adds that extra lay who would you play out of porro I'd probably play porro probably and then you'd play Smither instead of Rogers yeah probably probably yeah yeah because Smith surely he's had two weeks off he's had no International Duty yeah just he's surely he can play night now yeah you would think so you would think so and I think that fixture is good is yeah yeah don't yeah I'd probably play I'd back the home fixture for porro and a slightly greater attacking output from open play and then I would probably probably play Smith row over Rogers but yeah it's close it's close it is yeah people saying is going to be a p he's like no I don't know about that I think it's be tons isn't it yeah it is tons simply put yeah and then it's mcin after that and then maybe Watkins not Rogers there's not Rogers now don't think so be good if it was um yeah right let's have a quick look here is that all all wrapped up yeah yeah lovely so you're some you're only going to take a one one transfer at most aren't you you got no no hits this week oh yeah minus 12 you ni yeah just just the one I think oh B God otherwise nothing um so my team is Henderson in goal CBA Robinson and coner at the back and i' heard that coner got injured last night which is a bit irritating because he's been like my nice sleeper defender on the bench for these two fixtures yeah I've I put a tweet out about that seeing asking what's actually happened to him and no responses so I don't know well he went off and then it's apparently it sounded bad but then afterwards Carley said he looked okay to me but I haven't spoken to him so who knows I'm going to be waiting until that but anyway I'm going to play him and if he doesn't play Then porro is going to come on got Bruno obviously still he's such a difficult one this week because South Hampton looks like a juicy fixture of hoan's back um he returned returned for Portugal so yeah well he's always returning for bloody Portugal and not nfpl and I got As A Smith row SA munis isach and harand so at the this week yeah I think I'm hoping that he's good this week so I'm looking at maybe doing one of two things I'm either really conservative and I just do CBA to Trent with my one free transfer just so I'm on a Liverpool a little bit and I keep sacker and I keep Bruno or I take a minus four and do CBA sacka and Bruno to Trent Salah and minty that's my other option I think oh okay so you got two free transfer got two threee transfers yeah so I kind of think I think sacka I think Salah is going to outscore sacka this week I think Bruno could outscore minty even though he hasn't so far this season I think this is the game he probably could but I'm confident Trent will so I just don't know if it's worth a full fourpoint hit but then I like to be on that ahead of next game week where I probably will C Salah so yeah just Bruno hasn't lived up to his price in the first three games or United haven't their attacking numbers aren't good are kind of fancy a little bit of those Brighton games even though is a bit of a 70 to 80 minute person he has actually returned so yeah don't know what do you think about that I I like the Bruno fixture obviously so there's that um so maybe just the sleer move but yeah at the same time like and M and Trent those all sound good too so the other option is which is was at the start of the week but that's lesso now is isach to Pedro Saka to Salah civa to Trent obviously these are for minus four I'm using is to Pedro Saka to Salah and civa to Trent yeah but I the only reason I would probably favor the Bruno movies because I think isak's probably more likely to score points in the next two than Bruno is I still don't if I trust him enough and yeah so that's why not note to both of us stop picking brune I know stupid yeah stupid when did you get rid of him who did you get rid of him for I got Rogers and Watkins yeah that was it that was last week it was it was Bruno and um jebson to Watkins and Rogers yeah so I feel like the yeah I definitely want some some Liverpool players this week and CBA is an easy transfer out because I can do that anyway so I can just get Trent for him that's and that's a massive upgrade this and next week um and then it's just a question of whether I fancy Saka to do well against Spurs and Bruno to do anything against Southampton or just play it safe and get Salah and minty who probably will outscore them both this week and next as well so yeah yeah just do I'm probably going to do the minus four and then just leave the team as is until game six wild card so yeah we'll see cool all right does that wrap us up I think so we did a long show tonight yep it's because we're excited to be playing FPL again aren't we yeah we're we're back thankfully yeah right we'll hope for um good weekends and um yeah have we got anything else to add final thoughts Holland to break his leg all right that's what a nice note to end on what a lovely s oh yeah all right well let's hope that doesn't happen and let's hope they both score the same amount of points this game week how about that yeah the just same amount of points for the whole season lovely all right well thanks everyone for for watching and we'll we'll catch you next week unless is another International break Che yeah bye everyone good luck everyone have a,13160,against leicester so i was just like thats why would i play pedro is what it is 74 r 13m ive never been this low at the start of the season so before so uncharted terr for me and hopefully i could just start to get back up there cu you had a good game we game week one i think its its probably like a little bit of layer from people using triple captain in game week one and i always think like the ranks are always bench beast as well i always think ranks are a little bit bl at the start of the season because some players will play like newer players or not newer players but people who arent taking it seriously will wild card and youre right bench boost in my for instance my work mini league who is full of people or some people that dont take it as seriously as perhaps we might like chips have been thrown down gams one two and three with triple captains and bench boost so im putting some of it down to that as well so lets roll with roll with that all right what happened to me i had another harland hatrick which was lovely but then salah just he bit back again which i was bit disappointed about i didnt did i make any moves i dont think i did i think i rolled the transfer i contemplate didnt i getting rid of bruno for buo which would have been nice didnt go for it in the end and thats quite a lot of miss points but my the transfers will come in handy this week i think i got 77 harand captain c e got 10 that was about it didnt have any clean sheets but robinson got an assist and isack got some points it was pretty bar those two are the big difference i think a and robinson absolutely so it was a close game weekend i had a green ar but its nothing too exciting 22m lets see where we are after like game week 10 or 12 when were like a third of the way through the season and for in the millions then we can start panicking exactly right lets lets talk a little bit about this upcoming game week theres been a load of talk i think about wild card being played i nearly did it youve been talking about it a lot are you still nearly done it a few times as well im still undecided to be honest but i just think it seems early i think like youre right in previous seasons we would have thought about wild carding in the first international break because its only three game weeks this season that almost feels too early as well to be honest there been huge market movement like if i look at the front page of the premier leue fpl site pedro diaz harland salah all like the top transfers in anana is in there as well from villa and then people are like transferring out some good players isaks gone watkins sacka gardial palmer i think its three weeks is palmer like what i know i know hes been draining i know its crazy but i think that to make it a wild card at the moment the reason ive probably gone and not done it is because i havent found a wild card draft that i feel comfortable with i feel like i still dont know enough about each of the players is and the same i think ive ive tried to put things together and ive just not ive been like maybe like 5 short of like a good team that i like and its just like so at that point i would have to do a significant downgrade to someone where im just not not wanting to do that but at the same time hopefully in a few weeks like cheaper assets will come forward because like im going to start being priced out of the players that on this wild card i wont be able to get them because ill be rising up in prices and things so i got to hope watkins comes back this week and stuff like that and hopefully i can see him training soon because hes a worry because if hes out then im gonna have to wild card for sure because thats another player and jotter who knows whats happening with him just because darwins not gone on international break hes been training two weeks of slot so theres that worry as well might play and then all the do i want arsenal players anymore considering all the the other issues so what do you this is a bit more of a wider point you were you were quite like firm at the start of the season and still now that you didnt think harlem was good value and i think a lot of wild cards been played to double up on well just get both harand and salah do you still think even if you had the wild card to play now and when you play it in the future do you still think youre more minded to have one rather than the other i think i would probably still not have harand when ive been looking at drafts ive not been including harand i think thats thats probably like reflective of good pricing theres probably times this season where we want both but i feel the same when im looking at the teams i can do and i see drafts on twitter i think a team with both of them in just seems like so bloated for two assets and the rest of the team around it at the moment are filled with like picks we dont know are going to be good even so even with only just salah im still looking at a drafts where its like ive got two five million midfielders in there its just like its just because im trying to spend ive been looking at sun ive been looking at watkins pedro and isak still like i want to keep isak still i still want to keep so it was expensive forward line as well so but sun would probably have to go in that scenario unfortunately but i like some well talk about him later but well should we talk about some matches from this weekend and get excited about that and then perhaps wrap up at the end by talking about like picks we like for the for wild card yep cool do you want to do you want to kick off with the tottenham and arsenal game sure so so nor lad and derby i think its the last game of the week on the sunday night isnt it might be lets have a look fine last six results in the premier league spurs have had four losses one win one draw they scored nine goals arsenal one loss four wins one draw the opposite 13 goals scored for wise over the first three fixtures spurs surprisingly xg of 488 which is which theyve scored six goals which is seventh overall for teams and then an xgc of 36 the three conceded which is sixth best but thats better than arsenals xgc and better than the arsenals xg which is 448 and arsenals xgc is 37 so like spurs are beating arsenal in the attacking and defensive metrics in the data by the amount conceded arsenal conceded what is it like one and spurs seon three but still like number wise analytic wise spurs are in better form to be honest so interesting so rice is banned for this one which is a bit of concern i think its an offensive concern as well with his quality perent pieces his link up play as well and not being available in those phases of attacking seems to be is going to be an issue i think but at the same time they can probably play havit back there they can push him back into a pivot with parte and maybe georgino possibly so i dont think like the quality is that much of a drop off odard is also a bit of an issue as well hes like unofficially been saying hes going to be out for about three weeks i heard that too so maybe not the end of the world but possibly the end of the world in terms of maybe even this early in terms of the title race if they lose to spurs and city in the next two theyre gonna be quite a bit behind already so i think its a bad time for them to lose youre right like three weeks now theres like two such important away fixtures which probably two of their the most difficult are going to be this season because spurs are always up for the north london derby and city are going to want to put one over on them start of the season of course so just sacks record versus sps in the last six in the premier league so hes scored three goals and two assists which is pretty good and then suns record versus arsenal in the last six is five goals so thats pretty good too both main attackers from each team have good history form in this fixture so i would say most likely outcome is both teams to score so i think in my position ive got a sber and parro in my team ill be looking to start only one of them and its not clear which one is going to be the best to be honest because spurs are at home the data would say spur porro is better because hes hes quite attacking as well but then at the same time like spurs definitely gonna concede and is he gonna do anything attacking wise like who knows because their defense isnt massively changed like theyre still front theyre back for is still the same r is still there like i george is going to protect as hopefully with party as well like both of them will do the job re rice does so i dont think its gna be too bad defensively so at the moment im leaning towards sber stein but at the same time like i dont feel comfortable about it so and porro is maybe more fun i dont know like its its hard its its hard like i 5050 maybe back the home team but arsenal u the elite defense i me not this season so far but they have only conceded one and they kept two clean sheets out of three so but i think all attackers are worth playing here like havit sun sacka they all seem like good picks if slanks back could do fine hes probably a worse pick than someone like sun i think in this because i think hes probably going to get marked out the game by sber or gabrielle so and the big thing is probably havoc people were looking at him on wild card and stuff like that and ive ive been saying hes like such a good asset which i still think he is but like if hes going to start to play in the midfield three over the next two thats going to dent his appeal a bit i think its a its a good thing hes going to play like or from our selfish fpl point of view because i dont think many people will be investing in arsenal assets like now game we four and game week five but wild card 6 which looks like a prime window and arsenal got three good fixtures is then like if he is if od guards back in and havit is back up front by then it theres no f missing out of his points and hopefully he remains still a bit of a sleeper pick because im bit on him later but his my points per million value at the moment is far better than sacker and hes nearly matched him for points so far this season and i think hes theres a theres a case for having havocs only from game week six onwards to free up money in your midfields you dont necessarily need sacka but i i agree with you about arsenal this weekend i think taking two of their main three midfielders lets say out of the side is going to have its gna have a big impact theres no question about that and the backups arent as good i was watching a bit of planet fbl and they got a guy called clayton on there and hes an arsenal fan and hes just he was just saying that like he doesnt think its going to be that much of an issue i think theyre theyre good enough their team and the squad is good enough to like beat ter a bad spur well theyre not bad spur side but i still think theyre like good enough quality to still beat them and i think the players coming in is its more of a system rather than straight light for like players and those players can come in and do a job like georgino i think it was last year when he started playing games like he was good like he was he was not a weak link at all so well see but i think the attackers could i still think sacka like odard is the one thats usually linking up with him but i think hell probably get more space on that side now because hes hes going to have less people occupying his zone and s saa did well in this fixture last season remember he had like a goal and assist perhaps and i think hits had the same so i think youre right its going to be an open game and im think it not wouldnt be surprised if sacker and habits both return again this game week and return well i still like it from saaka like a lot of people are looking at saaka to salah and stuff like that to get salah in people have just harland and i see that but i can see saki getting something in this for sure absolutely all right should we move on chat a little bit about liverpool and forest it be good to hear your thoughts i noticed jammer in the chat sorry about the typing mentioned that he was looking to move away from liverpool assets in game week six and i think its its interesting i just theyve got such good over the next two and theyve shown such great promise in the start of the season it seems surprising to hear that wolves away crystal palace away and then chelsea home after six like those two are definitely still good like i think i watched a bit of raptors video as well saying that like if you wild card in seven or eight you can keep those liverpool players those two fixtures longer those good two away fixtures whereas the other people are probably moving off them and youve got a salah against wolves and palace who look bad defensively so well i think just speaking about this game specifically in terms of projected goals and clean sheet odds liverpool coming 28 expected goals this game week 46 chance of the clean sheet thats only very slightly behind city this game week forest with a expected goal rate of 7 6 clean sheet rate so the odds are favoring a big liverpool win and here on like im not surprised salah had hes played some minutes over the international break but i think hes going to be fine coming back into the into the team and interesting topic that we talk about every week is how well hes hes going to keep pace with harland or how well harlands going to keep pace with salah this season and thats going to be like the i think the main crux of all like talking point all season long five big chances so far this season thats thats second overall hes had hes had four big chances created which is first so i think the difference between hland and harand and salah so far this season is salahs creativity harand hasnt got that so if his if his goals drop off salahs getting the the points from creative outlets as well and i think in this game hes got another good chance to to score well and id be interested to see considering their similar matchups who people who if people own both salah and harland who theyre most likely going to captain and perhaps people in the comments or in the chat whove got both can tell us 141 and 17 in the last three so i imagine for you hes going to be nailed on captain this week i think so theres watkins with a good fixture watkins bit of an issue but i think isaac could be a good fixture too and then i think thats probably maybe even pedro that seems stupid but just because of his like price point but that its home fixture thats thats gc is good its good i want to get your thoughts on diaz right because hes hes predicted to maybe rise in price like point2 over this international break i was like considering on that sunday night but it was like that postmatch thing of like man i want that player thats thats done well but its a small sample size so far this season in three games which is again one of the reasons why ien played the wild card and what were seeing in these first three game weeks i dont know if its like a purple pack rather or purple patch rather than like its its a indication of what his season long form is so i had to look at what is i appreciate its under different managers but hes provide an attack and return this season every 56 minutes last season it was every 175 minutes so that comes down to two things has he got that much better over the summer or is he playing in a side that suits him better and gives him more licensed to do things and then if you look even more at his numbers so 076 xg per 90 so far this season against 041 xg per9 last season so hes roughly nearly doubled his expected goal output so far the season and i think thats why its so difficult to make like cut and dry decisions on these type of players who are i dont know who havent been like big fpl heroes in the in the past i think hes hes popular now but im not sure if its if its going to last what where do you sit on or where do you come on down on that i think youre probably right in like he probably has got better the system probably does suit him a bit more but at the same time like that is probably a little bit unsustainable i think hes just been fortunate to get on the back of some of the things and the ball for the his second against united i think just like happened to land in the spot where he just rifled at home first time like maybe thats good for him where he was just being in that position but at the same time like hes like i dont know a yard the other way he doesnt he doesnt get that chance so like hes a good pick like is but like hes coming back gl from south america just as someone like pedro like nobody thinks thats gonna be an issue but gat gos been playing in europe and darwins not played at all like gapco probably deserves some time like the slot hasnt rotated anyone so far i think apart from quansa so is he just so is he just gonna keep playing his first maybe 11 until he doesnt need to like and its the start of the champions league isnt it so weve got like were coming back from the international break into like another three games in a week spell so im sure there will be rotation like hes already not played diaz for full s in two of the opening three games youre paying a lot more for salah but youre getting those 90s i was coming around to the main question like for people who dont have a salah team and for people who are maybe going to walk hard salah out in a few game weeks is diaz like a good enough cover but i think probably the answer to that is going to come with more data and more knowledge of how he how he plays in this system like weve got three games to judge and one of those hes hes blanked in and iway i just think its interesting cuz hes near up to nearly 177 now up to near preseason and kungu levels of ownership and i just its just interesting he player i looked at but im just not quite so sure on him i think i think hell probably do the thing where like his front three he plays his first 11 and then he just takes off diaz jotter probably around the 60 mark and then j off salar off maybe around the 80 i could see that happening and then so that those three maybe trent again as well like the ones that he needs to be fit constantly just take them off a bit earlier see happen ive been so lucky with trent im just going to mention him briefly but like its criminal that i ever looked him in i went off last seasons forming that liverpool were not great defensively last season they had eight clean sheets all season didnt think they were going to make much of a difference theyve got like three already so nearly half of that total after three game weeks and trent has been so unlucky not to return big as well like that disallowed goal against united should have had a an assist for y in the brenford game i think it was and in the ip switch game so i hes like on my definite bring in list this game week and i cant sit through another pool game no like knowing that i could be on the end of a beating but hes been a beast and he was good for england got the assist last night for kane i just think he looks good sh and then just quickly on forest defense l before we move on theyre i was quite surprised so the projected goals and clean sheet odds heavily in aable favor but they have been decent defensively so far the season theyve not played the same caliber of opponent but theyre third best for expected goals conceded after three games liverpool on 21 expected gos conceded forest 25 i think its city is the other team in that mix theyve conceded five big chances which is the same as liverpool and like i say theyve had good fixtures we knew that but theyve theyve still performed and done well so i think it will be a i think it will be a tighter game than the man united game and maybe the most defensive team liverpool have played so far i think that i think that minkovich has made a difference he is he is a solid and good defender but i feel like that their numbers will certainly start to drop off with them with playing better teams i think liverpool should get like a twonil win thats seems fine to me will forest score do you see that i dont think so i dont i think that theyve only theyve had like the good fixtures at the start of this season and theyve only they only scored two in or is it three in three games i think wood scored two and more gibs white scored the other one maybe so theyve had like good fixtures and theyve not like scored multiple so i think they be surprised if they even score one im just checking it was one i think it was 1 one nil and 111 wasnt it so theyve not blown teams away and a lot of people are looking at double defense for liverpool and wild card which i understand from the three games but at the same time theyve faced not very good opposite opposition as well so man united you probably wouldnt expect a clean sheet theyre still capable so are they going to be like back to being good like defensively he remains to be seen but i think double up feels a little bit rich so also robinson is pretty attacking so i think robertson has looked like again hes looked good and hes on some set pieces hes slightly less expensive than trent but like i hes like a million cheaper but i dont know if id have robertson over trent id only have it as like a double and then and then youre right i dont know if i trust the a double enough but allison in goal has scored more point so far this season than trent but despite that i still dont think id double up with a defender and a goalkeeper from liverpool fair okay so for versus chelsea next one ive decided to look at so chelsea form wise zero clean sheets so far five conceded an xgc of 32 which is weirdly fourth best which i didnt see coming so their defense is looking pretty good like considering they played man city as well 37 shots for them which is midtable of all teams 11 big chances which is third of all teams and nextt year 508 which is six and then seven goals scored they scored six of them in that one game so maybe slightly inflated there as well bournemouth wise their xg of 599 which is third of all teams which is great for bourma 10 big chances sixth overall five goals scored xgc of 47 is 13th worst zero clean sheets and theyve conceded four so defense is not looking good probably looks good for palmer returns jackson returns things like that yes seeno he seems to be the hot pick at the moment 56m hes already risen once only 5 owned when i made these notes its probably gone up since then not blanked yet eight five and six for a player from b pretty good 19 points in three games so hes hes excellent considering his team but perhaps inflated by their fical difficulty of the first three of not forest away newcastle at home which newcastle away seemed to be worse and then everton away like those fixtures not too bad so maybe thats been inflated but then the fixtures from now on are pretty mixed so people are starting to bring them in but their fixtures are rough so chelse at home this week that could be a competitive game he still could still get returns liverpool way after that southampton home good leicester away is good good arsenal at home tough aston ver away and then man city home after that so thats a tough run that eight to 10 he he is 56m you can bench him you could probably sell him for someone back to like a smith r like that so like his price and his value seems to be good like those fixtures after chelsea and liverpool those two in the middle there are great so i think hes probably a fine pickup but so 17 shots puts in first for all players although that didnt include holland in the stats for some reason it just holland just wasnt showing up dont know why ask ff hub why that was happening but hes there now but you think hes second to him so okay fair enough so hes had two big chances xg of 119 key passes of four big chance is created of two and exit of 13 so i dont think his numbers look that amazing hes only had one bonus despite returning in all three games i was surprised about that as well i thought he would have ho some bonus as well absolutely saying so i dont think his returns are sustainable is what im trying to say but then again that at 55m whos not risen yet tavanir whos played pretty much the same minutes hes only played six few minutes hes at 3 owned his xg is beating menos or 21 versus 12 and their expected points tavers is higher on 20 versus 17 so hes had one goal versus sans two goals one assist but at the same time like theres a player whos got more xg maybe thats just saying that like sanu has been a little bit fortunate to get these returns whereas others havent got them and hes still at 55 you dont you can sa that 01 as well he might be might be good for that and hes playing hes fit hes hes usually a talent man for that bom of team so his expected points rate is higher than sos after the thir game wees as well so exactly thats which does surprise me considering the returns so im not saying pick him or anything its just a matchup focus wise like tavanir could be someone who does well in this one as well i like it i like it i fancy bour up to win this game to be honest like they their expected goals youre right probably slightly higher because chelsea have played city theyre still theyre still decent chelsea padded those numbers by scoring six against wolves so no i think this is going to be quite an open game and i wouldnt be surprised to see cenia continue his run and what i quite like about bouth now even though they like clawed it back late against everon so you cant say that was like a good performance i think theyre still trying to like work out how their team is plays without salanki and it seems like theyve got lots of inexpensive players who were chipping into to make the goals happen so maybe thats not great from an fpl point of view because its a bit of a spread but it does mean there are some some a lot of options potentially i think that evan nson like i said is a quality player as well once he just settles down and starts to start hitting some goals he might be on penalties as well because he theyll probably want to give it to him to start game scoring goals so hell hes six million hes going to be a good route when they have a good run of fixtures its because the striker picks are limited arent they and hes going to be a decent option ill talk about palmer eventually when we talk about wild card picks thats why ive not mentioned him yet cool from 11 to n to 20 i was just having a look on the ticker they got like a green or gray fixture run according to fpl the only like gray marked games theyve got a spurs at home which they can score in man united away which they absolutely can score in and full them away so they a good run of games from game week 11 so i like the look of them right lets sorry theyre cheap as well so its going to be easy to get on to them exactly lets just quickly talk about city and brenford then so projected goals and clean sheet odds like i mentioned against for po i wanted to just compare the two of them man city slightly higher predicted goals this game week 29 to liverpool or 295 to liverpools 28 exactly strange because liverpools x year is higher than city i i thought the same too and i think its just based on last season odds as well but 46 chance for clean sheet is the same as liverpool forest have sorry brenford again almost the same in terms of projected goals 76 and a 5 clean sheet al i dont know why the returns dont quite marry up but so theyre bookies are expecting man city to score slightly higher goals negligible as bren considering against city recently i think theyve been quite good against city as well and like last season in i think it was the double game week when we all triple captain harland they played brenford at home and harand just got a single goal in that game and he struggled again in a way game against brenford i think that was one of the first games after he came back from injury when foden got a hattrick but he hasnt been he hasnt been great against brenford in previous seasons and the season before that they beat them at they had here had so but hes been in great form this season 23 i love that this season exactly 23 big per average per game this season 12 xg average per game so i think the main question is how much can he keep this up or what can he keep up so far this season because his price has gone up now so 152 for him for anyone thats getting on is its quite a big jum didnt take much for to go up in price and his ownership just too bad about ha true 67 ownership now i think he was like 50 when the season started so weve had a lot of converts i just looking at i think the main reason youre going to have to own harand is because you want to cap in every week i dont think you can own him and not think about captaining every week so i was having a look at the fixes you got coming up so brenford arsenal and newcastle and next three games i think you can captain him in the brenford game and you can probably now captain him in the arsenal game without rice and potentially odard there i think that makes it more of like a mustwin game for city and the newcastle game they havent been like great defensively so i think fine but if youre looking for alternatives in the arsenal game salahs got a plum fixure that game week suns got a good game during that game week and then 7 to 12 i was looking at these fixtures thinking theres no reason i wouldnt want to captain him in all of these games fulham at home wolves away southampton at home is the next juicy one for people talking about triple captain bournemouth away brighton away is maybe the most tricky one and then tottenham at home so i think its at the moment like for me i like its difficult because i like the salad drafts more at the moment but i think the fomo of not having haren captain is almost is too great and that but and i also dont like the double up like i say because of the weaker team so it and i think as soon as one of them has like a blank this season theres going to be so much transfer activity of being like my god sals bled weve got to take him out and get harland or my god harlands not worth 152 and that will absolutely happen therell be so many transfers either way wt there i feel like its g one of them is gonna blank this week i feel like its the week that one of them its more likely to be sal do you think i was gonna sayland but i think thats thats whats great so far about this season because you can either try both in a team and like have cheaper players around it which jammer in the chat earlier said hes done with good success because hes doing better than both of us at the moment but i dont know i dont like living with the fomo anyway its its interesting hes playing out of his skin so far this season and seven goals in three games just apparently put up an absolute st like one of the worst performan hes ever had apparently in the norway first game against kazakstan finished nil and its just like odard and harland in that game and its nil against kazakhstan its like i saw some reporter put up just like some absolute just slo fest at holland the worst game hes ever seen him play and he was just utterly awful so thats funny but its he can have like the very odd bad game like that game against arsenal last season at home was poor and thats probably one of the reasons why i want to bring in s in the next two game weeks just to cover that arenal game where im not sure dont even think its that odd that he has badame like gotam games where he just disappears and he just doesnt make any but like whats been the difference so far this season is like hes still not getting the touches but hes just getting the one touch to finish some of his finishes were just crazy thats second goal against west ham he just like touched it and then belted it in and even the third one thinking like how is he how had the defense given him so much time as well he just had so much time to just take a touch and just launch it but even as zip finishes against zip which apart from the penalty were pretty good as well so i thought kilman would do a number on him but no it didnt happen didnt its down to nathan collins this week come on collins lad know no im loving it at the moment i think its i think its its great that weve got like the diverse captain picks but you i feel like as soon as one of them blanks is going to be mass hysteria and panic and im all for that im scared what else i got to say about this one just i think thats was pretty much it on the only other player on city is worth talking about is lewis like hes gone up to 47 now 14 points in his first three games a six a two and a six thats just despite the fact theyve lost two clean sheets hes got an attacking return he hit the crossbar in that ip switch game per personally hes like not for me because he falls into that category of man city defender which has notoriously been apart from probably canelo and gardial at the end of last season is always a bit of rotation risk but hes played 3 90 minutes so far this season and maybe hes taking that spot from walker a is now injured so i was gonna say like a is now injured so like people seem to think thats gonna help v which sure it will but like at the same time we saw lewis play left back for england last night so like he can play left back as well i just think it makes his exms go up as well if not more so walker could play and then lewis could play on the left like give guardio a game off like that could happen but at the same time like lewis hes playing all the games so maybe he needs a game off so i think if youre on wild card and you can afford like he is just 47m and you can rotate him or whatever and you can or if you play him you can afford for whoever comes on to do is a decent sub or whatever then he probably is a good pick well at the same time think he probably will get minutes off the bench over if he does ag so theres theres that it will be frustrating im just having a look at that they havent got that many defenders in fpl theyve only got seven one of them z whos probably injured now for some length of time it sounded like it was quite bad stones and walker have barely played probably because hes a bit like foden hes bringing him back up to speed slowly because they all last night though so did he play full 90 i think so i dont know but so i assume hes fit now well anyway it just be interesting to see how again i wouldnt want to take a pun on him this early because im so conservative but and also i dont think i dont think city are that reliable for clean or as reliable for clean shits even though hes only 47 so i dont know what do what do you think hes hes probably not for me hes not my player but i think if hes if hes still starting every game by the time i wild card then ill ill ill be looking at him but now if i was going to do it now i would probably want that one maverick pick and then he probably would be it harry in the chat said pet rouette is about to come into force anytime now uccl starting for picking and i agree especially when it comes to their defense in three games next week and the fact that the arsenal game is at the end of like the champions league week makes you think there will be some rotation maybe rotation will be in ucl but definitely something to keep an eye on i think if anyone is looking to sell scker as well if youre not going to sal sell or whatever like de bruyne for thef game seems hes played all three 90s he started all three of them i think thats interesting but he could easily get benched before champions league as well though but de bruyne seems fun hes hes super low owned as well what is he 11 thats not bad is it 96m and then weve got foden to come back in sometime time who knows when thats going to be though no idea he played 45 minutes against chelsea and then he disappeared again so maybe time for the the first just had a look at the minutes he played 45 minutes against chelsea and then hes not played since i dont even remember that nether do i okay fair enough gs played more minutes in the year so i think still too early to make some decisions on city mids shall we talk about some wild card picks briefly yep and talk about okay so the guy who i didnt mention in the chelsea bournemouth one was palmer 106m now 41 owned like the twitter sphere has not owned in most of the season but 41 is crazy bournemouth away next west ham away after that brighton at home not in forest at home those two in a row seemed good liverpool away and then newcastle at home so those two after that so good but 276 from three games so far five returns from an xgi of 19 bruno has had zero returns from an xgi of two 20 so theres theres fpl for you in a nutshell ridiculous so the fixtures to me like look ins s enticing on paper but im less im less sure bouth have looked like pretty competitive so far west ham have a good team but like they did can see quite a few toand and then brighton and forest no walk no walkovers anymore thats a sure so that those two games should be competitive just because chelsea are know near as good as they have been so i would definitely include on w card for sure like he is a top pick absolutely but i do think the runner is the run is like tougher than it looks on paper like he so i had to look at his appearances for like in the premier league and for chelsea and stuff against these teams so two appearances versus bournemouth like hes had one assist two appearances versus west ham hes had one goal four appearances versus brighton so this is probably while being part of city team but you one goal against them and then three appearances versus forest and one assist so he has he has had returns against all the next four but theyre not hes not hauling hes not having massive returns like but the same like 106m for like a goal like every game or a return game that seems fine well not majorly fine but still passible what do you think about it i would absolutely own him on wild card i think it i think if i was wild carding this week and a lot of people wild carded last week to get him in if i was wild carding him this week i would probably have him as well over sacka and then i think a play would prob not to go with harl i dont think you can probably have like holland salah and palmer and a and a decent squad around that i think hes been blown up by that huge game against wolves like seven the 17 point pointer there he shown last season hes capable of that i think hes i think hes absolutely solid pick and i think whats quite nice about this start of this season is the way they priced the midfielders have like returned in line with that like salah is the most expensive and hes led the way slightly after that palmer is slightly outscored s and then around just underneath sacka youve got sun so i think the pricing is aligned to how theyve scored so far and what i said what i said last when we talked about surprises and stuff like i havent been surprised by these players so i know so no i think i like palmer i also like sacka and at the moment what were find is we cant have more but if i was going to wild card this week i would probably have palmer over sacka and back him to do well he seems to be playing that number 10 roll well could have returned more against palace it looked like quite an open game so there were times in the highlights where he was like he and the chelsea players were just like running at three people in palace defense and henderson somehow bailed them out so and hes hes more expensive than the second so its easy to get back as well absolutely sure okay well hes probably not that much of a surprise but his ownership is only 8 and thats him in buo so i dont think even if youre on wild card now its like its necessarily a bad time to get him in so i think hes proven his worth already as the fifth highest scoring mid and its so annoying because we knew he was going to be good he started last season well and had such a great season until he got injured and that derailed him a little bit but hes hes proven himself as a good fpl player he monopolizes set pieces hes a good finisher and hes scored 24 points after three games so far the season i think if youre want a wild card now its like not a bad time to preamp getting him for his good run i think only this city game is tricky and then spurs away i we talked about it the other week i would fancy him to get g to get a return against spurs away and then after that his and brentfords run is nice we talked about before game week six to 12 its all greens and grays on the fixture ticker so i think hes as important to his club as is to his monopolizes set pieces he gets that extra point those are all things we already know so im surprised are you surprised hes still only 8 well i think for people wild carding now is they might look at the next two and be like i can probably not go there but even for me or you that possibly arent wild carding now like we could look at the next two and be like probably back against that then look at him from six seven on i just feel like game week five is like the sneaky pick for him i feel like he could he could do well in that game and wait an extra week why not get on him early but ne the jotter j to him in game five work nice okay you got any anyone to talk about so robinson and we did mention him a little bit earlier three sixes so far no bonus but only 65 owned i think as we said i think you would own him with trent if youre gonna do it but he absolutely passes the it test at the moment so ive got a little american football analogy like trent feels like hes like the quarterback where robinson feels like hes like a wide receiver like getting high and wide and providing like good goal threat as from a defensive angle so he passes the ey test he doesnt necessarily pass the status test where hes got five key passes which is third that doesnt necessarily lead to any goals or assists and stuff but 3 xg which is 11th football defenders two shots which is not that high hes had threatening shots at least xa of 39 big chance is created is zero and one big chance himself so he looks like hes probably going to be getting more attacking goals possibly than assist so like i said his stats dont jump off the page its more of a grass pick than analytical pick 22 xgc for paul is the best defensive numbers in the premier league so far with zero goals conceded if we assume their defense is still going to be good and they can keep clean sheets the floor for robertson can now be a clean sheet and hes got much like attacking potential a much higher upside than he did before because he was always looking at like a base of two liverpool were conceeding all the time and trent had more a threat whereas now hes got possibly a base of six which hes hes proved so far in his three matches and hes hes just like trent has been unlucky to not get attacking returns so i think if youre picking on one card like those two at the back for the next three or four at least seem great to me its just i think you absolutely pick trent and robinson is just someone you could just pick on the side as just a low upside pick no i like the robinson pick as well i think if to go with salah hes hes going to be nailed on and like we said earlier i think hes hes got the capability of getting a return because hes on some corners and set pieces as well so i think a lot of it relies on liverpools defense being good so we remains to be you see so say same with trent as well theyve both been been taken off a bit early which is it can be good for defenders as well so they got that possibility too on other wild cpic so again maybe ive done a couple more i think minty is someone who are impressed us in preseason and there been like okay so far this season without being like great hes been outperformed by mata moma but appreciate hes probably not hes not as expensive as that and aingers done well hes got two returns in three games a four two and a four he was the one that had the big chance against arsenal that rey saved and pedro followed in onto got the assist in that way and in the everton game we obvious he came off at half time and he got his concussion so theres who can say what he would have done in the second half but he would have at least got two more points from that so hes an interesting pick hes hes certainly not as popular as pedro welbeck but i think hes pretty well priced mid if youre switching to a 352 he looks more attacking than someone like smith row who ive had and for all mids under 57 hes fairing not too badly so hes hes not great on xg so far hes at 02 xg per 90 so thats eighth of all mids under 57 so thats not great but he tops the expected assists per 90 so hes got an expected assist rate of 08 per 90 so thats the first of all mids under 57 so collect like collectively hes hes probably one of hes one of the better assets in that 55m bracket and his fixtures are mixed like we said the next two are good for brighton i think if you were looking to for some short termism against s and forest that looks like a good route and even that chelsea game and the spurs game afterwards not too bad but its not like plain sailing green greens and grays in the tracker its a little bit mixed hes probably worth targeting for the next two but hes hes gonna get taken off early most games and we have seen that he has been like ainger is too good to just stay on the bench for 90s so but hes hes great as well but hes but he been a long way away like africa for his internationals and so see how he comes back as well guess i l looked it up he finished his he finished his international break like on monday he played his last game so i think he might be back or back already so i think hes hes definitely an interesting hes probably not like the best option from brighton but hes because aing is there but hes he showed like it could be a good option this year yep okay so another one i wanted to mention is son hes 10m 991 owned so hes hes a good differential at the moment this arsenal fixture looks tough on paper but at the same time like weve mentioned rice and odard being out like this is probably the time if youre gonna go there on wild card and stuff like i think hes a great pick and then i think the fixtures for him like attacking wise i think that they suit his play style of fast countering attack countering against teams that should attack them at the same time so like brenford man united brighton west ham palace villa those all seem like games that are suited for him to get goals on the on the on the counterattack so i think hes been absolutely overlooked on wild cards because he is expensive and people are looking at palmer but like those fixtures to me i can absolutely see him possibly outscoring palmer over that lot brenford they all sound good honestly like so hes got a good record as ive mentioned as well in north l derby so i dont think this week is that big of a reason to not pick him as well so we also like its a shame that doms been injured we dont know if hes gonna come straight back in and what that situation is gonna look at look like but i dont think that should put us off him as much either because like like palmer hes got big in him so tottenhams xg of 488 which is seventh as i said like 127 xg from himself which is eighth of all mids two big chances five passes two big chances cre so hes looking like hes good on both sides of the ball of assist and attacking potential so assumingly hell be on penalties we dont know for sure but as of right now he probably is so i think hes a great pick i like sun and i have like already early season regret because as one of my i had done him in a lot of my drafts in preseason then in like the last week i got turned onto this salanki and bruno idea rather than son and pedro and thats like set me back some points but hes hes hes been good and im sure hell continue to be good but like we talked about a bit earlier as well hes going to be some impact with salanki coming back maybe that makes salanki a good pick for less a bit like havitz and sack at the minute so it could but at the same time we dont know if sank is back true so far we dont we ans probably is usually quite good on telling telling us when hes gonna be back so well see and just mentioned h hav thing quickly so hes another one to mention for wild carding again like we mentioned i dont think this northland derby game is one to be worried about because i expect its going to be quite open but hes offering a better points per million than sacka so far this season its a small sample size but its not much to separate the two of them considering as a 19m gap so hes outperformed sacka for xg so far 15 to 13 this is per game i should say expected assist hes nowhere near though expected assist of just 01 per game to sackers 06 but his expected points is similar 148 to 16 so its relatively close and in game week six when the arsenals fix just turn and they played two of the marides back toback at home in leicester and southampton and then bournemouth i think hell pretty much guarantee but being my team and then three game weeks proof of what theyre like together could set the set the tone for who to hold for the longer term well isach to hav game at six that sounds fantastic as well i think he does and i think having not having scker in your team does allow you to have sun instead and theres going to be the parallels do you have sacker and salanki or hs and i think youd want double off on attack to right definitely for those three games but im thinking like longer term after that theres a theres a reason to have like only one arsenal attacker as your coverage and if its if it looks if havitz is performing better than lets say jackson and sank it gives you more impetus to have like the another attacker from chelsea your spurs in your midfield yep fair okay just add do you want to mention anything else no thats fine on that ill just mention very quickly as going a little bit over time but dunk 45m 67 owned i dont you see a reason why you wouldnt just put them on your wild card like the next two sound fantastic theyve kept one clean sheet so far at a three like they look better defensively these ipwi iwit and not and forest at home is great chelsea and top them after that not great but you can bench then newcastle wolves okay you can play him liverpool man city after that not great but 12 onwards again bournemouth southampton fulham leicester crystal palace west united brenford like that run is great so if youre looking for a cheap defender like i think just stick him there you can just bench him with someone so always worth a shot on goal as well like even an own goal so be aware of that but at same time like next two looks so good like if switch have 121 xg of over three games which is 20 from the league wow so by far the worst xg so like that looks like it should be a nailed on clean sheet at home for bri and then n forest a 478 xg but they only scored three goals so that looks like a good cheap clean sheet possibility as well so 39 xgc is eighth of all teams and thats only 02 behind arsenals like elite back line that weve seen over the past seasons so one shot four key passes one big chance created like lots of fullbacks dont get one big chance created so i like him i think hes going to be spoilers for my team if im not wild carding ill be getting him in for hall whos in my team at the moment so nice should we talk about our teams then yes lets do it so you me im still surprised you say you might still wild card its just the jotter thing i think is a is a worry just because of you darwin like i dont but like so if j doesnt play but hell probably come off the bench wont he so maybe thats not even that much of an issue if j doesnt start like he can come off the bench against forest and probably do something so thank you so hall to dunk seems likely and then ill ill be benching one of pedro or sba and i have no idea who yet and then bailey is now injured apparently for villa so rogers like ive been tempted to just play smith row and just like not double up but at the same time rogers x minutes have gone up again with bayy out but bailey out affects their attack probably so and then again if waters watkins is injured then that puts it another blood i i could it will be interesting to see how they manage his minutes because theyve got that champions league game away on the in the week it was just like a small hes been playing the games hes been going up early hes had two weeks rest like surely absolutely fine surely i expect probably play like 60 70 minutes though again maybe durans been good but like watkins is their star like theres no way hes getting benched randomly if hes not injured so and isak i still think is hes talked about people owning him and selling him in fbl asnt he and hes hes ready for a brace as he says so happy to own isach still i think this is a great fixure for and walls have been conceding for fun so like that so i will have cover if i make that move for hall to dunk for whatever happens just im gonna have to a z in the northland derby with pedro that would be nice but youd have to play youd have to play mate anyway what would like flip you into wanting to wild card because the team looks okay if you heard watkins and y were out that and sck saks okay s would be fine like so if j if nuno is said to be getting the nod then that would affect things as i said like joton off the bench is probably not that bad but if watkins is injured those two would be a big thing no i think i think and i think dunk is probably i could get muno for palace against lester at home that seems good but say i dont want the double up of defense so and hes five more expensive and ive got one in the bank and i just want to just keep that change there no i agree no i think the team looks good for this week i think if i think if everton is the villa fixer against evertons the one which is going to make it just because of the two of them there i put my team on twitter and saying like this looks like an obvious wild card right and then and most people were just like youre an idiot okay fair enough i think absolutely not i wouldnt dont think you need a wild card i think it looks good for this week to be honest but as soon as if you do get dunk playing him i think that just adds that extra lay who would you play out of porro id probably play porro probably and then youd play smither instead of rogers probably because smith surely hes had two weeks off hes had no international duty just hes surely he can play night now you would think so you would think so and i think that fixture is good is dont id probably play id back the home fixture for porro and a slightly greater attacking output from open play and then i would probably play smith row over rogers but its close its close it is people saying is going to be a p hes like no i dont know about that i think its be tons isnt it it is tons simply put and then its mcin after that and then maybe watkins not rogers theres not rogers now dont think so be good if it was right lets have a quick look here is that all wrapped up lovely so youre some youre only going to take a one transfer at most arent you got no hits this week minus 12 you ni just the one i think b god otherwise nothing so my team is henderson in goal cba robinson and coner at the back and i heard that coner got injured last night which is a bit irritating because hes been like my nice sleeper defender on the bench for these two fixtures ive i put a tweet out about that seeing asking whats happened to him and no responses so i dont know well he went off and then its apparently it sounded bad but then afterwards carley said he looked okay to me but i havent spoken to him so who knows im going to be waiting until that but anyway im going to play him and if he doesnt play then porro is going to come on got bruno still hes such a difficult one this week because south hampton looks like a juicy fixture of hoans back he returned for portugal so well hes always returning for bloody portugal and not nfpl and i got as a smith row sa munis isach and harand so at the this week i think im hoping that hes good this week so im looking at maybe doing one of two things im either conservative and i just do cba to trent with my one free transfer just so im on a liverpool a little bit and i keep sacker and i keep bruno or i take a minus four and do cba sacka and bruno to trent salah and minty thats my other option i think okay so you got two free transfer got two threee transfers so i think i think sacka i think salah is going to outscore sacka this week i think bruno could outscore minty even though he hasnt so far this season i think this is the game he probably could but im confident trent will so i just dont know if its worth a full fourpoint hit but then i like to be on that ahead of next game week where i probably will c salah so just bruno hasnt lived up to his price in the first three games or united havent their attacking numbers arent good are fancy a little bit of those brighton games even though is a bit of a 70 to 80 minute person he has returned so dont know what do you think about that i like the bruno fixture so theres that so maybe just the sleer move but at the same time like and m and trent those all sound good too so the other option is which is was at the start of the week but thats lesso now is isach to pedro saka to salah civa to trent these are for minus four im using is to pedro saka to salah and civa to trent but i the only reason i would probably favor the bruno movies because i think isaks probably more likely to score points in the next two than bruno is i still dont if i trust him enough and so thats why not note to both of us stop picking brune i know stupid stupid when did you get rid of him who did you get rid of him for i got rogers and watkins that was it that was last week it was it was bruno and jebson to watkins and rogers so i feel like the i definitely want some liverpool players this week and cba is an easy transfer out because i can do that anyway so i can just get trent for him thats and thats a massive upgrade this and next week and then its just a question of whether i fancy saka to do well against spurs and bruno to do anything against southampton or just play it safe and get salah and minty who probably will outscore them both this week and next as well so just do im probably going to do the minus four and then just leave the team as is until game six wild card so well see cool all right does that wrap us up i think so we did a long show tonight yep its because were excited to be playing fpl again arent we were were back thankfully right well hope for good weekends and have we got anything else to add final thoughts holland to break his leg all right thats what a nice note to end on what a lovely s all right well lets hope that doesnt happen and lets hope they both score the same amount of points this game week how about that the just same amount of points for the whole season lovely all right well thanks everyone for watching and well well catch you next week unless is another international break che bye everyone good luck everyone have a,11976

evening and welcome to Elite FPL and today is the game week four preview myself and Steve have done the wild cards how have done our wild cards along with many others in the community and uh today we're here to talk some uh total BS and uh maybe influence you to make a change or two of your team steo hello how's it going oh hang on talk now hello hello St how you doing yeah hello everybody bit of a different environment today and my M why is that why is that tell tell everybody go on I'm away from London two weeks away from well not complete two weeks but virtually two weeks away from London so be back in London on Friday or Saturday and then back on Monday for another week or so so yeah very quiet down here isn't it J it's great unlike your day today what driving all the way up to rexam and getting absolutely smashed by hailstones yeah it's been a really quiet day yeah uh five hours driving getting absolutely so do you know what there one there one thing worse than being stood outside getting soaked through the one thing worse than that is getting in a car or no in a van in this case and then driving for 2 and a half hours Home soaking wet it's horrible it is horrible um but anyway enough of that um good evening everybody hello to fireo Ba's here Connor's here Matthew edish is here uh Jonathan Mahoney what no Graphics is here too uh shout out to Alex Vol with the thumbnail as always um so yeah wild cart are you uh I mean is it me or am I I completely I could be completely wrong but is it me or has there been absolutely nothing in terms of price Rises for the last four or five days no nothing so really um it's not been much to do in terms of jiggling your team around to try and capture those um we kind of looked at your team on the Wild Card uh on last week um and obviously did a stream with Ray as well we talk about and you talked a bit more about your wild card you seemed like you weren't 100% set on every player um there was a suggestion of going without Harland now I am very curious as to find out are you going to go ahead with that idea of going no Harland and load up in Midfield and bring in Ole Watkins or are you going to hold fast to what you've got or had on your previous draft with Harland and Salah in your team so um we'll start off with you and then we'll talk about me I'm pretty boring my my team is pretty much the same I've not done anything to my team but I'm more interested in knowing what you've done with your team um have you got a screenshot of it or do you want to just talk to us about it it is in the team screenshots it's the one with Watkins in it's not that difficult to find like three or four up team screenshots Discord team screenshots yeah yeah I'm still adamant on not going Holland for three game weeks you're not going Holland yeah for three game weeks but with this news of odard rice and various other Arsenal players not going to be playing for Arsenal for the next week two weeks or whatever I'm a bit concerned about havs and I've been playing around with various drafts but to be completely honest with you Jay I just keep coming back to the no hen draft with what which is which is fleen V rugan Robertson Rob Robertson Robinson gavves Alexander arold Lewis Rogers seeno and Bremo Palmer Salah havs one of the Brighton two I can't see because it's off the screen and Watkins okay yeah I I keep coming back to it Jay I spoke to Ry earlier about Arsenal assets and he said just avoid them for the next two two game weeks he just doesn't know they how they set up but let's get real here sacka is the only player which isn't going to be messed about along with obviously the Defenders but we're talking from an attacking perspective here I want to go triple Liverpool I'm not really too confident on their guaranteed front three apart from Salah J and Diaz's minutes are a bit a bit doy I still think they are the yeah they are the preferred front three there's no question in that but with Champions League with the likes of gapo there Nunes the other bloke that they brought in not suggesting for them they're all guaranteed to start versus brenford Nottingham Forest not brenford Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth and whatnot but like you say a bit of uncertainty of them starting whereas with Robertson and Trent Alexander Arnold they're guaranteed no matter what they're going to be playing with the likes of Watkins I said to Ray look fixes build for their upcoming fixures are incredible Everton's defense is just they're non-existent Jes and I think that that game against Aston Villa on Saturday I believe it is could be very profitable could be the kickart OE Watkins needs to to to start his season scoring and yeah don't get me wrong haland against brenford I'm not expecting him not to do anything but I think that there's more upside with the other players returning than there is for their for The Replacements that I would have if I had hen so The Replacements would be it's for instance Senor in for Robertson Diaz in for Palmer they're pretty much the two so and then obviously hland in for Watkins and I think that the combination of Watkins Palmer and Robertson the three game weeks is better than haland Diaz and daa in this case what do you think I I see your logic behind it I think that it's a risk um certainly is a baller move um yes maybe fractionally I can see maybe a slight upside on those three players I mean you're right about Diaz I mean he's not guaranteed I think he'll play for large parts of a game but he's not guaranteed the 90 minutes I I completely agree with that um we've got um people in big tips in chat saying get Sterling and Captain god um but no um I think that there's reasoning behind it which makes sense it's a it's a strategic three-week move um your Captain's going to be with Salah yes yeah or Watkins no right okay so your captain sorted you've got a strong team you're going to have a few differentials from others um you may be getting ahead on Watkins before anyone else and capturing price Rises there if he goes off on one this weekend guarantee he's going to get a 0.1 or point2 right so um I don't think it's that risky to be honest I don't think that if you do lose points on it it will be VI much at all in fact I wouldn't be surprised if if worst case you kind of break even in a weird way um barring of course a harand hatrick again which would be just absolutely ridiculous against brenford um who are very good and certainly it'll be a tough game um no I can see your thoughts and I'm actually I'm not going to lie steo I like it and maybe might consider doing something similar but I don't know um this team does have I think it's one point I haven't even changed the team yet I'm literally waiting until Ray it's not Saturday morning once all the price because Watkins po potentially could be going down again and he won't do but there's a small small chance I think he's at 30% at the moment going down by God yeah by Friday evening he could he could he could go down to 8.8 again unlikely all the players that I've got aren't going to be going down in price and none of them are going to be going up in price like Robertson he ain't going to be going up in price can I ask an honest question have you copied fire I copied Fire have you have you copied fireo strategy no I've copied FPL Olympian and Andy Martin I had this discussion with Ray on the patreon and I had it with him on the stream itself and I just said at the of the day you've got to with this particular game if you want to win you need to attack it and right now I just think that hland going into those three fixtures with Renford Arsenal Newcastle I just think that the players that I've got have got a better opportunity to come through ahead of the other three to be completely Frank like we saw n well I did watch it it wasn't interested but I one thing I will say one one thing I will say is Robertson at six million I don't consider him an attacking option anymore purely as a watching him I don't think of him as being the same Robertson of two three seasons ago however you know you you're other pick I mean the fact that you've got havitz the fact that you have got havitz and Watkins in it's it is a tasty team and you know uh I think that I think your rotation pairing between fleen and veran is very very good like you mentioned as well previous on stream I think your defense is very good got some very good options there okay Greaves at 4 million who cares about him but Robertson's very good Fulham um you got two big hitters in Robertson Alexander arold Liverpool keeping a clean sheet no no doubt about it in my mind um Lewis question marks but at the moment is I think I think was safe to say he's okay he's safe at the moment may not may not be for the rest of to season but right now he's safe um people are I've seen Onana from from Villa being transferred in on mass as well and uh as a as a as an alternative to Rogers is that something that you have thought about or not even not even bothered about well as I said every time I do a wild card I've been doing it regularly quite today actually specifically based on what Ray was saying about just avoid Arsenal but once you take that 8 million out with have or 8.1 whatever what Strikers are there there's no there's no striker in the bracket of sheet sheet where I'm like I'm confident with h there's nobody so you've got to look at the likes of Welbeck I don't want to be double up doubling up on right attack plus he's gone up to 5.7 you've then got I've got wck and um I got wck and the other one um Pedro yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly I I played around with that but it just meant that my Midfield thing gets shot to Pieces I'm really keen on Palmer Jason really keen on Palmer okay I think that he's gonna be another onei well he didn't he get an assist the other night yeah didn't he get an assist last night wasn't it yeah he's not going to be moving out of that team you know the the the front I mean Ry made a point about Nicholas Jackson for coverage of Chelsea I I just I just prefer Palmer and plus my team has got penalty takers Palmer and Burma Salah and also another option I had was I genuinely had Palmer saaka and bermo and Salah but my front three was just well one of them was just non-existent I wasn't really happy having I think it was Watkins and headro as my front I wasn't happy with that at all I want that solid front three the only players in my team that I'm not particularly Overjoyed with seeno havs and Rogers baring that I'm pretty happy with my my team I think it's there was a consideration for e but listening to F juice and um the the comedian Jim Daly he's a Crystal Palace fan he doesn't think that Crystal Palace going be pulling up trees but then he's saying that fair to be fair to e he has been very unlucky well there's a you know against West Ham he h the he woodwork didn't he he h the wood I'm pretty sure he hit the woodwork against brenford he came very close from a free kick as well it's like um yeah I I just think that as a for me like there was a question mark like when I was doing the wild card um I was thinking to myself do I include him keep him in is obviously dropped down to 6.9 at the moment um but no I think I think he's I think he's a good he's still very much a pivotal player in that team and I think I keep him um but yeah so so Steve I'm going to ask the question that you tend to ask and I know you probably expect it what percentage likelihood is this team going to be your team when it comes to game updating uh Saturday morning I'm about 90 I've been sitting on this team for a while I'm like 95% if not higher it's going to happen unless I hear some news about one of the players is definitely not going to be playing the problem the problem is though Jay is I'm GNA be on the motorway when the deadline is going to be approaching so me being back home on Saturday by what is it 11 o'clock is it 11 Yeah by 11 o'clock is it's going to be very very tight the earliest I'm GNA be home is 10:30 and that's me pushing it so I reckon I'm goingon to miss the deadline so I'm gonna have to do it Saturday morning hoping that I mean most of the players that we're aware of are going to be fit and ready and available unless mraay was to come out and say nope Ole Watkins isn't gonna be playing on Saturday if I was to hear that it's like right I'm gonna I'm just H it's gonna be hen and hen in and then have some Watkins out and whatever I can play with at that point but certainly right now as it stands I'm about 95% certain I'm going to be going in with those three games because by the time he gets to game seven and I want to bring hanen back I'll be probably taking out it's gonna be Salah or Palmer depending on how they perform over the next three fixures but it's probably gonna be Salah I think think I worked the anywhere I can afford it I'll have two free transfers by game week seven I believe it is and yeah I'm going to need howand back and that's the only thing that makes me want to hold howand is because of the fact that he's probably gonna be I would say 15.3 by the time he gets the game week seven I think that's how much he's going to be 15.3 unless by some miracle he drops down in price because he does nothing over the next three game weeks but history against brenford isn't that great Jay it's not that good at all brenford they not win Man City do like playing brenford but it's not by high scoring margins I think there was only one anomaly when they won 3-1 but other than that it's all twos yeah hanen could score in fact I think if I'm predicting now hen gets two goals just the way he's playing at the moment and the way man city are and yeah Ray is right you know the Howen captaincy could ruin me but if I can get through it with Watkins potentially doing really well against Everton and Salah you know Liverpool's uh form against Nottingham Forest is very very good they like playing Nottingham Forest especially at home they like playing and and the way they're playing at the moment they're scoring goals for fun they're on fire at the moment Liverpool so yeah it's is literally gonna be gritting my teeth because I'll be doing the 3 pm kickoffs on Saturday so anybody listening now I'm yeah I'm doing the three because I can't do s well there's no point doing Saturday evening because there's a bloody match at 8 o00 so G to do the 3M kickoffs and it's going to be through gritty teeth covering those matches because obviously Man City and Liverpool are playing at the same time and I do expect me to be knowing that hen's going to come through with um a double digit score but again we we we we we we we can only uh yes the question the question I I want to ask about my team is on the wild cut do I do I have players I rotate on a weekly basis on this case with this coming weekend it be it'll be the likes of Brian and bumo that I would relegate to the bench um obviously in favor of e of all people funny enough uh who's got um a fixture which I kind of like of Lester at home so um obviously gonna have 4.5 mid defender in mazeri um with FaZe as well as a CHP for for Leicester but the question I have is if I was to jiggle a couple of players around and not do the the the rotation and risk carrying points on my bench get rid of UMO say bring in um for the sake of argument a cheap midfielder okay what's a cheap midfielder in this day and age Rogers or or um maybe Onana for for for um for ason Villa or who you say Winks yeah is 4.5 no no I was thinking of like a five mil which would so like a five mil price point you seeno may no I think Onana or or probably Rogers because I think Rogers on penalties and he did well in the under 21s as as was mentioned earlier on but let's just say for example I took emo out and brought Rogers in and then I could then afford to drop Welbeck and Pedro out of the team because to be honest with you I look at them and I'm like do I really want to be going with double b attack I could then go I could then go Watkins in okay maseri out for for Greaves and then have 4.8 attacker so then essentially what it would go from having the likes of maaari um and buo uh on the bench to then having basically playing Watkins in place um so let me just let me just give you an example um so I would play um dunk Alexander Arnold Lewis and probably um another Defender to do 442 instead of a 343 so um I guess where I'm coming from is if I if I was to do that I would essentially go 442 and have Watkins in play Watkins and um Rogers Watkins Rogers and save Greaves uh or face playing instead of Welbeck uh Pedro and E so like like for example is so it's like in my head it's I'm ra like in my head I'm like do I want to have players like emo on my bench or E on my bench you you you are going with hanen and Salah aren't you yes I am yeah and you're adamant on that yes I am yeah yeah that that's the the tough decision for you because I'm choosing for those three game weeks to go against and I could be priced out of hanen by game seven I could be and you sacrificing but then again that's just for Watkins who's at the moment you know he's an unknown like well he's not he's just not he's probably not even matchfit I don't think it's that I I I think that M hasn't he come out and said that he he he wasn't oh yeah matchfit yeah he's trying to get up to speed with playing the full 90 and I'm pretty certain he said that he wants to manage his minutes yes something worse to that effect and like to say fixtures build form and with those three fixtures for Watkins or Aston Villa Everton walls and ipswitch I'm not saying ips switch a rollovers but it builds form Jets and if he was to if he was to get say two goals against Everton confidence at that point goes into the Wolves game who haven't exactly been looking sharp and I think that with Watkins being the guaranteed starter for Aston Ville one of the guaranteed STS for rest because that's the problem with ason v you with the defense there's only a few that you know that are going to play with the Champions League coming up they're gonna be swapping around like m m maton I'd love to be able to own Matson I'd love to own him mate but I can't because he's he's he's a he isn't going a guaranteed to start for that's he definely play the Champions League oh he guaranteed to play the champions league but premier league is just not an option unfortunately and with the news that Conor's out I don't know who replaces coner in that in that team by accounts it didn't look good according to reports so is there a player that steps up for Aston Villa that's again another guaranteed stter for at Center back and yeah yeah I I I just I just look at the Aston Villa fixes and think you can't look at gift ORS in the mouth at the moment and when you're on Wild Card yeah the scary thought is going without hland but it's Arsenal and Newcastle they're not easy fixes no they're not easy at all and I even though hanen at the moment is in probably potentially the form of his life and a lot of the big hitters in FPL slash the world of football seem to be specifically in the Premier League seem to be doing exceptionally well like sacka Salah haland hmer they all seem to be constantly returning this this anomaly of just howand and Salah returning exact the same points it's just absurd it won't continue and I and I sadly do think that haland is probably going to outscore Salah this week probably but across the next three expect Salah to outscore howand because of the fixtures I can't remember what is salah's third fixture he's got forest bourou and then he's got Forest Bournemouth Wolves Away oh that's right hen's yeah got brenford Arsenal and then Newcastle yes and Arsenal enjoy playing Man City at the moment last three fixes Arsenal have come out on top well they haven't I don't think they've lost the last three is that right Arsenal yes yeah they hav lost the last three so I think Etta knows how to another fight now I know they've lost particular individuals that are key to the way Arsenal play but I I defensively that're they're still top in the division and I think they'll nullify Hatland I think they'll do they'll do a job against Hatland but that's why I'm not too it's going to be scary I'm not going to lie I'm not going to sit here in my M's stair room be like oh P's going to do crap over there of course there's that scary thought but if I get through these next three fixtures with like you stated breaking even or at worst case scenario maybe being 10 points behind or maybe even five or 10 points ahead it's just GNA be like got I got through it now it's full of at home that F at home is another fixture where it's triple ccy option possibly and then what is it Southampton a few weeks later game week nine triple captaincy option you'd be mad not to have him at this at that point but right now I think it's just about time just to come off the hanen vanwagon but with someone like yourself that's happy to go with both it just as you've just demonstrated it well the thing is if I was to go off the hen B wagon I can tell you one thing for definite de bruyne will be coming straight in my team oh okay oh that's interesting why is that apart from coverage and you know just just having coverage in city um I tell you what that's a that you know when you look at your Rivals teams and you like when I look at your wild card I go oh God you've got hen and Salah that's not good the rest of it I'm like whatever but you saying that if you got rid of hanen and brought in Kevin De br I'll tell you what that is that is a possible Game Changer possible Game Changer he's a big game player as well well it would free it would free up an absolute shedload of money um i' rather have Kevin De bruyne than sea fact if I could get to I can't do I may even look do you know what jaay with what Ray was saying getting rid of seeno for Kevin De bruyne I'm GNA I'm GNA have a look at later after this stream I may look at that later great it's a good sh j a good sh we I could tell I could tell you one one thing now is that I could get in mind you saying that Diaz again you make a very good point about Diaz and uncertainty over starts well not starts but minutes sorry minutes not starts I misspoke um I'm I'm looking at the team and I I I don't even really like e in my team um but like say I was to go right um let me just quickly have a look at this here um if I was to get that player in um talk can you read the chat by the way the chat may or may not be may or may not be saying something uh right I would have 17 and a half to spend on midfielders um so then let's to see what I can get you got rid of Han what for Watkins no for I've just put havitz in so who's your front three then well Pedro Welbeck and havitz but I think who's more nailed Pedro Welbeck right now it's well but it would be P they're both nailed they're both gu yeah well I was kind of thinking like is there a difference between two I'm just ripping up my my team at [Music] um that's the only for me I'm not blown away by Strikers are you no no no I think we've well I I know for fact I've missed the boat and th wood I went moon is over wood no one's getting Watkins in by the way it seems like what I say that's the point he could he could drop by Saturday morning it's unlikely but there's a small possibility like for me I'm just looking at this and the team you can make without Harland is is T it is it is very tempting how do you get you got to ask yourself yeah you can't because I I did that earlier I I just rinsed my budget and I was like oh yeah team's really good oh wait a minute I can't get H back without well without without doing yeah without doing some serious um but I'm like looking at like MoneyWise I wish I could share my screen with you right now because it's quite it's quite interesting um so would I go 352 I'm tempted I mean Welbeck havt Watkins salad Diaz madai de bruyne oh my God it's like i' got I still got 12.7 to spend yeah name that Midfield again hang on let me just fill my Midfield out a second because I'm just um so Diaz saler Alexander Arnold um I could afford to go I mean to be honest I could get anyone in I could absolutely get anyone in in in my Midfield there I just put Rogers in I have 7.6 for a midfielder steo sorry for a Defender 7.6 for a Defender well you've got horo Robertson and then you you got triple Liverpool anyway have you got triple Liverpool I got triple Liverpool yeah but if I was to get Diaz out and do you did I think P personally that could give me 9.1 9.1 from mid Fielder and who's your midfielders at the moment I tell you now hang on but then if you can I'd be getting rid of Fernandez no no come on no if you can get sacka get rid of HS for sacka and then you f I can do that I can do that yeah I can do that that striking spot with I couldn't even tell you're right now Watkins Welbeck and I mean the Midfield would be de bruyne madek Rogers saaka and Salah well if you were plan I'll tell you what if you were planning on doing a 352 what does that leave you in the bank with sacka well I'm just thinking because I could just do a a cheape striker and then upgrade Rogers but then well I was thinking upgrading medaw if you could potentially get to Palmer if it's possible um well I would have to do who's who's a cheapy Striker that's playing at the moment it' be 4.5 wouldn't it so what money have you got left well if I put 4.5 in and I take mad out I'd have 9.1 ah you you're 1.4 five short of armmer see this is what was happening to me earlier but remember you got to remember how do you get hen back in that is it yeah that's why my team it works relatively well because I can do hand in straight swap for free if you're going to spend all your money which is fine but you need I say you need you're gonna want Hen back with that full and fixed and that run that run from game week seven on Wards is sick and you have made me think about Kevin De bruy I'm going to look at that like I said after this stream I'm gonna look at that and see how it goes because who who are the lots in your team though Jam who absolute guarantee No Matter What by Saturday deadline this player is gonna these players are gonna be I'm ass locks locks in my team will be to be fair with you most of them like the only one that's un unlikely well the only question marks I've got in my team are IM Bremo who I'm not a massive F like I'm not massively excited about owning him and maybe e what what are you laughing at and bur's an absolute key compar to brenford yeah but he's got some very he's got some tough fixtures what to he's got I would even class that West Ham at home is I think it' be a tough one no no no no no brenford they're very good team they're not going to wipe him they're not going to wipe him aside mate well no but again and Verma scores goals no Tony anymore no Tony him and Visa him and viser are going to be the two key players for brenford to be scoring the goals and and he's on penalties as well their fixtures do turn and I think it's from Tottenham they've got decent history versus Tottenham as well yeah well read some of the things that the chat saying KDP Cooks versus Arsenal says big tips it's close between Harland and Salah this week for Captain says Andrew Ferguson uh Arsenal could be without odard says Maestro um I'm on the same mind as steo on Salo and Haren says Dan the man um so we've got are you going without Harland steo says marro and yes the answer is yes potentially good luck uh uh could he back um could he B A hatrick of hat tricks I mean that'd be very very unlikely but possible um Connor says I Ward and tripled up on Liverpool players with Allison Diaz Salah uh Liverpool's next three fictions are juicy um no one has ever done backto back hat tricks before have they well back to back to back you mean hattrick of hattricks um I feel like it has been done I can't I can't think of the playoff as from my head you know you know if you're think of of Strikers you think of Ronaldo Christian Ronaldo Messi of course the three La I mean the Premier League prob probably not no I just mean in general across Europe it's not the world how many who scored a hatrick of a hatrick of a hatrick it is I don't think it's probably in fact even scoring a double hatrick is rare enough ER and Holland's in a very small Elite group of players that have done back-to-back hat tricks and to get a triple hat break I think he'd be literally in a group of one with himself I'm reading this um there's no denying that haland is an absolute Beast of a map 23 years old isn't he 22 23 seven players have scored seven players have scored three consecutive hattricks in a professional football in England but never has it happened in the Premier League and in fact the feat has not been a chief since 1946 worldwide the record for the most successive hat trick stands at five which happened on three occasions at various levels of the game so Masashi Nakayama scored four hat-- tricks four hattricks in a row in between the 15th to the 29th of April 1998 in that was in the J League um so Japan yeah the the level of football is different of course but um back in 1998 I'd imagine but yeah um Joseph ban scored five hat-tricks in a row in 1939 to 1940 um 17th of November to 19th of March he also was known to have 5,000 goals Joseph bishan more goals than Ronaldo the air raid was coming over all the goep are running away oh there's a slight controversy over whether Joseph bchan's achievement can officially be classified as a record that is because it took place in a wartime League following the outbreak of second world war and it was a clear standard of the league had dropped however two things can't be argued Joseph bchan scored five successive hat-tricks and 19 goals in total in the Bohemia and Mala League between the November 1989 and March 1940 and two Joseph Bashan was truly an incredible goal scorer between 1931 and 1957 bychan scored 783 goals in 488 games and another 26 in 33 games at International level nearly every single one of his goals for his Club was scored in the top division of either the Austrian or Czechoslovakian league in 1931 age 17 by chance scored a first half hat-trick and four goals in total on his debut for Rapid Vienna in 1955 age 42 ban played the last League match of his career for Dynamo Prague he scored four times in that game my god the guy was a beast this is the elite FPL Channel everybody we're here to talk about the pre post World War I more most most well this one's 2016 September 2016 to November 2016 Stefan lanik l shanic five hat-tricks in a row in the Croatian football league so lurking in the seventh tier of Croatian football playing in a simple Stadium of a capacity of 850 fans which is quite formidable for seventh tier NK dra NK drich dakovo may not be a place that you would expect finding record equaling Striker but that's what happened in 2016 when Stefan luchang bagged a hattrick in the 10-n win over enk zinsky dren I I'm sorry I don't I don't know how to pronounce these it gave him five successive hattricks and 20 goals in total of five games it's crazy but if there's any Austrian Austrian F make sure you comment in the video afterwards let us know if you know this person so only so okay in England Top Flight Frank Osborne Tottenham in 1925 Frank Osborne South African born was the first man to achieve this feat back in 1925 Osborne's family moved to England 1911 uh so yeah very long time ago um this is the thing about England this is this is the thing about football you can never say that no one's done this or that because it's gone back like football goes back so hundreds of years so like someone may have done it and and a few players have aned Amed ruvan five hat-tricks in a row in October 2019 Ahmad ruvan matched the Feats of Joseph ban and Stefan lanic when he scored five hatch picks in successive games in a duve premier league a top level of Malian professional football I mean again um standards different from premier league but it has been done in in professional football anyway we move on because this we could be all night talking about this um about Japanese League eight yeah seventh League of of of uh oh God but yeah we'll just we'll just talk about um we talk about uh the game shall we um let's move on just quickly going back to the Wild Card all seriousness You're Expecting most of those players to be in the team that you've got there it's just a few that you're a bit UNC you're concerned over that's it well well for me it's having players that I'm rotating that are good like for example 7 million um Bremo on the bench this week and then who who I bench next week e and then from that it's like well you know he's going to have good fix he's got good fixtures as well like I would say man united at home is a nice fixture for you know so who do I am I am I benching and bremma again Spurs away I mean Spurs away come on I mean that could be a tasty one for him um so the question is am I weakening my team by having such money on the bench and the answer probably is going to be yes well we saw it with Fire's team last week too much money on the bench you you said it yourself if you're G to go if you're GNA say that to fireo then imagine this week you're Bening and Burma when he gets that obligatory penalty against Man City and SCS well while E's just sat there on two points after drawing with Le a one one I don't know who never will but it's a it's a tough decision to make I know a lot of people are probably going to bench in burm anyway I get it but like you say it's money on the on on the bench and that's why I'm kind of happy with my wild card team and why I'm going into the deadline knowing that covering the 3M kickoffs is going to be nail biting but we can get through it we get through it with um both hen and Salah doing all right it'll be then onto the Aston Villa Game hoping that Watkins can do where is the evening fixture if you could choose between if you could choose personally between Pedro and Welbeck would you choose Welbeck only only because he is guaranteed to start on Saturday because of the fact that he's in the country the fact that Pedro is on penalties edges it for me but also wellbe to be fair is their is their front management performing very well so in actual fact and answer your question right now I'd probably go wellbe I'd go wellbe personally we've got a 4.4 midfielder steo I've got something that's just transpired where I could play a non-playing 4.4 and and have a team which is quite formidable would you like to know the Dilemma would you like to know the combination chat I'm about to put it on the screen get ready for this are you ready brace yourselves for an amazing set of transfers here we say goodbye to Brian let's go to transfers we say goodbye to Brian and Bremo we say goodbye to eay We Say Goodbye are you ready you ready for the next one a nope mazeri we say hello to Greaves at 4.0 who's playing we say hello to franer a non-playing 4.4 right and then steo brace yourself we say hello to sacka and we keep our three of Pedro Welbeck and Harland but we now go with a 343 of dun Alexander Arnold Rico Lewis madai Saka Diaz Salah as the power four Pedro Welbeck and Harland as the front three that so basically would mean I would say goodbye to um Bremo who' be my bench fodder that I don't play and I replace him with a non-playing franer which goes third sub e upgrades to sa sacka and play and plays and non-playing maseri who I brought him from just to be honest because he's a man united player and I wanted a man player comes gavves comes in for him so a a bench player comes in for a bench player a non-playing bench player in Bremo comes in for a non-playing bench player in Franco okay you could argue I'm weakening My overall Squad because I've got a non-player but I still have two playing players on the bench and E upgrades to sacka thoughts steo Arsenal coverage as well Arsenal coverage so be so be dunk Alexander Arnold Rico Lewis madai saaka Diaz Salah Pedro Welbeck harand with Henderson and fabianski in goal me zero money in the bank zero money in the bank I've got exact money to do that let's see what the chat say who's watching this is anyone even watching this than sure and subscribing oh we are on X tonight I hope you put us on X Jam I we are on X but I'm just worried because I I I closed the uh chat that I was using to chat shag says hate it yikes [ __ ] B oh I've sworn now great fire to our moderators has got me in trouble season over Trent to Robo franka to Rogers Welbeck to vissa don't need to do those moves I mean I I don't need to I don't need to do that I could go Trent to Robertson if you're watching on the replay comment on the video below make sure you're doing this I would need to do vissa why would I want vissa in my team I could do Rogers so what you guys are liking this more do you like that more I mean to be honest that don't catch you that bad steo what's that um that don't look too bad actually so it would be Robertson instead of Trent and it would be Rogers instead of non-playing franer but then you're not going to be playing Rogers then I no but I I can stomach I can stomach not playing Rogers at 5.1 a a non-existent Everton defense he's going to be saing on your bench two bright and forwards kills it for me I don't think it does I I like the two bright and forward what's that fixes if switch this week and it's Lester I believe is that right Jay say again Brighton's next fix several fixtures they're good they're not too bad attacking perspective oh no Bri Brighton's fixtures are very nice yeah I think it's very very puny going with the two Brighton assets I mean it's yeah I mean there there comes risks with it of course but um you know what it's not the worst it's not the worst shout you know doing the Rogers in and and Dan Green Trent to Robertson but then Rob Robinson's not going to get you the output that Trent's gonna get you's been performing very very well but Trent is on set pieces and he looks like he's going to be getting a double digit return very soon there is it wouldn't surprise me if it was against Nottingham Forest mark this book mark this everybody clip it against Nottingham Forest 12 point coming in for Trent Alexander AR and then three bonus on top of that 15 points for Trent Alexander Arnold this week he's not in the forest a team that creates lots of chances but can't put the ball in the back of the net only seem to be able to score one Liverpool like to play Nottingham Forest they like to play them a lot Jason's looking at getting rid of the that's why I like much Robson and Trent doubler that's why I like it a lot because with j and Diaz again preferred front three but with Champions League approaching remember champions league is from next week jet starts next week whatever the format is I don't care it starts next week and this is when we're going to learn who the key components are for for most teams we know that Salah is guaranteed for Liverpool we know the likes of Hal and Kevin De bruyne are a guaranteed to start in both for Champions League but Walker I think Walker's going to be the Champions League player and Lewis is the Premier League apart from the tough games Lewis ain't going to be playing against Arsenal if he does if Lewis plays against Arsenal then we know on a minute here we've potentially got a manity bargain on our hands potentially and that's why I like your idea of can I get rid of seeno and have Kevin De bruyne instead and get rid of havs and bring in whomever I don't know we find out but I'll find out after the stream I can do that so I like that like idea the good thing about these discussions is we get to bounce these ideas off and like forget rivalry like at the end of the day we all want to do well at the game we want to do we wanna we W to get as high up of the ranks as we possibly can and let's get real here be nice as we keep saying every year for me and you to do really well the game and then it' be nice get get get the people along that um want to watch us for tips on a side not just a quick side note everybody make the hell out of our streams I was well I was watching well I wasn't watching I find YouTube comments really interesting Chas I find YouTube comments really interesting and what I've noticed is that when very popular FPL accounts go on to other channels or vice versa I always find it really interesting that the comments that the videos get afterwards just blow my mind that the I don't know the the the thick difficulty of people that watch FPL content like it'll be oh my God this this content is so unique please make more it's not that unique it's just two people chatting FPL oh my God I can't believe you're in a studio it's amazing I wish more channels did Studio based content in a studio it's not that unique it's not different it's just again two BLS in the studio I just find it really interesting seeing the kind of people that comment and you realize that there's a ginormous Market out there of FPL accounts that know nothing of other channels whether you're big or small whether you're small like us or big time like blackbox people there are people that are completely unaware of the content that is that is available and yeah I think that if me and you actually is my point about when I said at the start of the season I want to go in my gut my gut feeling is go without hand for three games You' said it yourself at the start of the Season you want to play the game where you're not feeling pressurized you just want to play the game how you want to play yeah and if we actually have that mindset and stick through it at least at that point when it pays off it's [ __ ] hell Kevin de bruyer he's come through with a double digit Hall here versus Arsenal whereas hen's done nothing they beat they beat they beat Arsenal 2-0 and Kevin De bruyne got a goal and assist and you'd be the one that has Kevin De bruyne and I've copied you but it's true whereas you you are there's nothing wrong with asking the chat but then they're just going to come back with what you've experienced which is go with a popular pcks you just back to template there's nothing wrong with temp nothing wrong with no but no like you and I agree safety in numbers for a lot of people of course yeah there's a reason why 10 plate works but also there's a reason why people like firo Dread do so well at this game because they're picking players which are outside the box and are going against the 10 play well shag shag put in the chat can't you just take a risk on no harand for the three game weeks and get him on game week seven um you can still get you can still Captain Salah up to game we seven means you can spread funds up to that game week well that's exactly what steo is um doing well seems to be doing anyway um but you you are completely right you can absolutely go without Harland and like I mentioned earlier on you could put de bruyer in and have a bit of that attacking coverage that pick is you think how unlucky you were with the bruyne versus oh my God I felt you know sick I felt sick watching the highlights didn't I I mean you saw my face watching the highlights it was just like it was torture because he was absolutely doing the business he looks very very much in form um he looks fit he looks like he's going to score like most times that he's in front of a goal so um yeah can we get on with the predictions because I know we're I mean obviously you've got everything in front of you so you can carry on with it but obviously we got our super Brew everybody and actually while while I'm

on X make sure you're jumping over to YouTube say hi say hi to Jason the only one with the technology yeah let's let's crack on James with our predictions for game week four I'm still messing around my team this I I I'm just looking at this and thinking you know what I could do this I could do that I could do this I could do that and it's like oh my God like there's so much choice is that without without Holland yeah this is the thing but you've got to keep in your mind Jess how do I get back in for game s he will tear it up against foot unless he drops off form so dramatically that actually oh wait a minute I'm kind of glad I haven't got him I'm just I'm just looking at this and I'm thinking this like who are the best defenders I mean there's not amazing there not an amazing choice for me Defender wise well it's Liverpool Arsenal to start with easily and then I'd argue you'd then be looking at potentially brenford with their upcoming fixtures you then have we could laugh but but um someone like potentially someone like Crystal Palace they got a decent upcoming run of fixtures but there are teams there Jas you can choose from yeah I I just I again this whole this whole oh no Harland it kind of entices you toit to mix up the rest of your team because you free up so much money but it makes you feel to spend all the money yes that's how you feel and that's what I fell into the Trap of when I Saka Palmer Salah and someone else who I've completely forgotten about it's frightening what you can do but it means that you can't it is frightening what you can do it it really really is and like you could even and this this might be controversial this might be controversial but you could even bring in Bernardo Silva Silva no now now that is I mean that is strong okay okay I was being sarcastic yeah um right let's move on to the let's move on to the um The Games Shall We let's take this seriously let's take the stream seriously for a change yeah yeah um let me just find where the chat's gone because I don't see it anywhere um and all these 3M kickoffs Saturday everybody great to see lots of you supporting the channel 3M kickoffs 3M on Saturday 3 p pm on Saturday get yourself here we'll be well steo will be watching the game 120 people watching which is incredible uh hello to everybody uh I can see the chat again now evening Nick from F juices here hello Nick how's it going guys uh CRA is the best defender in the world says Russ Morgan in the chat froden is 10 years younger for the same price would rather have legs over de bruyne's legs says Alexander mcbrien in the chat they're still looking at anyway I I'm I'm not touching my my team I don't think tonight um to be honest man it's just it's over it's it's frying my brain frying my brain okay so South Southampton versus Manchester United steo Southampton V man united um I am going to go with a a 21 win for Manchester United of course I am because I'm biased uh St your thoughts on this game Southampton man united Southampton at home of course um it's on TNT Sports you gonna watch it no no what I will say though is that am I right in saying man united seem to be better away from home than they are at home historically yes that's right I think man united Come Away with the clean sheating this can't score they're useless they'll be a typical possession based football man united will take advantage of it and I'm going to go with I was thinking Oneil I'll go I'll go two nil because of the quality I think gach has got a start hasn't he well I've been saying that for a while but nothing um Brighton versus zp switch uh two two one to Brighton I'm going to go 3-1 to Brighton 3-1 to Brighton even s are defensively not as bad as what people are making out it's just can they cope with the intensity of the Premier League team that's what it seems to have been cting them out uh just the fact that this the Premier League fitness levels I think they do all right and then they just seem to fade off and that's when they're caught out and I expect I think Brighton should be winning this I don't think they're going to score three I I'm going to go I'm gonna go two1 Jay is that that's the first 3 P.M isn't it or one of the three it's it's one of the 3 PMS yeah which steo will be covering uh Crystal Palace versus Leicester um with e on on my team at the moment as it stands um I think Crystal Palace has got enough in them to just uh to win this by a goal margin I'm going to go 2-1 to Crystal Palace we talking of leester James vardy J at 5.6 million I was looking to maybe fit him in genuinely guaranteed for Leicester they got some decent rolling Back The Years steo rolling Back The Years well as Dan says I generally think that honestly that he could be an option for you jaay at 5.6 but how do you fit him in with with the quality of players you've got already Crystal Palace it' be one it' be one of the Brighton boys out wouldn't it but no it's not happening that's the thing I I think like you say I'm stay in the bloody obvious Crystal pal should be winning this struggling to score goals though they're struggling I think potentially potentially Jake this could be a shock result in the sense of leer could get something here I think on super Brew I'm probably gonna go 2-1 I'm gonna bold I'm gonna bold the state now that Leicester could get a one1 draw okay one-1 draw says steo um Fulham versus West Ham a derby game of Epic Proportions it's going to be this is a I I'm not too sure how this one's going to go I can see one all I could see 2-1 either way um I'm going to go with Fulham 2-1 another 2-1 prediction F another team who I've seen them a couple of times I've just not been particularly impressed by them at all and moon is absolute Wast is all right he's done okay by all accounts um Fad in and out of games you can tell he's got quality about him there's no denying it against West Ham though West versus East it's a big old Journey for West H to get there I know that for facts so I'm gonna go with quicker to take a flight in it well you you get a flight from Stan said to he from the piad diddy line down to Hammersmith and you could walk the 20 minute yeah you are right yeah could you imagine that for could you imagine that in this day and age for your carbon foot print um yeah we flew for five minutes uh right so so I think West have got I think West Ham have got the better quality even though f up good at home col if you're watching I'm GNA go with West Ham to nichas 21 up next we've got one of the spicier um one of the two spicy uh 3 PMS we got Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest in a game where I fully expect Liverpool to just dominate um I think not only will have their chances but I think it's going to be two or two two nil to Liverpool in this game maybe even three um thoughts St yeah I looked at the history uh for Man City and Liverpool over the next three fixtures and Liverpool's history versus the lights of night Forest warmouth especially are very very good at home there lots of three Nils four Nils things like that versus the two respective teams and I I think Liverpool it's going to sound ridiculous but I have this feeling that not for a score but Liverpool come out and win 3-1 3-1 31 I can already he writing so why if you got Liverpool double defense yeah well I'm gonna go 3-1 Jam Manchester City versus brenford is the next game that's on the list here um I would expect Man City to just do a professional job I don't think it's going to be two three four goals I think it's just going to be a two you heard two two-nil win for Manchester City 2-nil um to have Harland or not question I don't think harand scores both but I think he will be involved in at least one goal in this game Man City 2 brenford nil steo I'm going an extra goal I'm gonna go three even though the history genuinely from what I remember it was just two Nils two ons to Man City even there's the odd game here there brenford have actually come out on top think the last time they played each other last season I think Man City won 3-1 but I think that was a way I could be wrong there but I'm sure it's sort of 3-1 to man city either way I'm gonna go three nil and hen I think he gets two Jay I fear that I think hen Captain has come out on top this week annoyingly and I'll be but that's but but but that's part of your three-week plan is that hopefully over the three weeks you're over the absolutely um Aston Villa versus Everton um I think Everton are and I think Aston Villa are going to get a win here home team again to win uh Wally Watkins could it be the game where he goes back up to 9 million um I think I think Aston Villa to win this one nil one nil yeah just one n say that I'm again I'm certain of Saw of the history suggesting a low-scoring game and ask yeah I don't think I don't I don't think it's going to be more than one I think because of Everton's depleted defense I'm gonna go with Aston Villa to take advantage and I'm gonna go with I think as I don't know why Aston Villa always seem to concede I'm gonna go 21 to ason Villa who's going to score Cal Le L McNeil they've got yeah L Bournemouth versus Chelsea steo uh you go first well I've got some menu in this game I think I'm actually gonna be play I think I've got him playing I can't remember now think if I have him or not but I think this is going to be a high scoring game it's based on absolutely nothing J they Bournemouth they seem have figh in them they play went against Newcastle they get a 33 draw no 22 no they beat Everton 32 I I think this is gonna be another 3-2 I'm gonna go for Chelsea I'm gonna go 3-2 to Chelsea I think this is gonna be a really entertaining high scoring game eight o'clock isn't it yeah I don't know why they've chosen that game I wonder if Dan will be watching it by the way Dan it's 40 today happy birthday Dan remember that Jay wow sing song Come On happy birthday to Dan 40 uh okay give me give me a moment and I'll sing him a song well no we sing together can't we St well no no you can sing Let me just hum the song and you can sing over it it's simple oh [Music] God happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear d boy happy to everybody in chat wish D happy birthday there we go happy Birthday Dad you go to the Bournemouth game and and then Ray's 40 next week two people in the 40s not I'm not singing another one for Ray but no uh let's move on to Spurs versus Arsenal um Spurs Arsenal uh a fixture that's 2 o' fixture um Spurs Arsenal Spurs I think Spurs won't be an easy one for Arsenal I think this could be a 2-2 I'm gonna go 2-2 wow yes obviously we've discussed that Arsenal have got several key players out and this is tottenham's opportunity to take advantage Tottenham are very good at home even though they score I believe again I could be wrong but I'm pretty certain last season they scored less goals at home than they did away against Arsenal they hate playing Arsenal Arsenal Lov playing Tottenham I think Arsenal I still think they've got the edge and I'm gonna go with Ray and Dan the two 40 year olds and I'm gonna go with Arsenal to win this 21 okay the AA teams win 21 uh and finally the wolves versus Newcastle game at half past 4 uh has anyone got anyone in this playing in this game anyone got any Newcastle players left anyone got Isaac anyone got you know any anyone from Newcastle anyone no no don't all put your hands up um steo what's your thoughts on this I'm do you want me to go first you want to go first oh I'll go first you got to start it off relatively they played well but they you know that I think that 62 hammering by Chelsea was an anomaly they're up against the Newcastle team who by all accounts in the in the behind the scenes Jay is not looking Rosy people aren't particularly happy and I think that again I'm sure the history is a regular nil nil one1 and I'm not I've not been impressed by Newcastle ACC all jaay and I think I'm going to do that I'm going to go one I'm going to go 1-1 [Music] Jace 1-1 yeah I think um I think I'm going to give Newcastle the win here I'm going to go 2-1 to Newcastle just um I think they will start kicking gear and I think Isaac is going to score in this game and uh make managers rethink um maybe a good performance from New Castle obviously a way molu yeah could could could swing the other way around it could be wolves that Come Away with a 2-1 win but I think I'm going to go 2-1 Newcastle what what a what a game to have at 4:30 I mean I get the fact thatal local Derby but come on why is that not at 430 it's not riveting let's be honest with you I think I'll be in my car driving then back to Deon in car in the car in my M's car bloom bloom do you know do

let the l get let your thoughts be free let your thoughts be free out of side and out of w out of and out of m good evening and welcome to elite fpl and today is the game week four preview myself and steve have done the wild cards how have done our wild cards along with many others in the community and today were here to talk some total bs and maybe influence you to make a change or two of your team steo hello hows it going hang on talk now hello st how you doing hello everybody bit of a different environment today and my m why is that why is that tell everybody go on im away from london two weeks away from well not complete two weeks but virtually two weeks away from london so be back in london on friday or saturday and then back on monday for another week or so very quiet down here isnt it j its great unlike your day today what driving all the way up to rexam and getting absolutely smashed by hailstones its been a quiet day five hours driving getting absolutely so do what there one there one thing worse than being stood outside getting soaked through the one thing worse than that is getting in a car or no in a van in this case and then driving for 2 and a half hours home soaking wet its horrible it is horrible but anyway enough of that good evening everybody hello to fireo bas here connors here matthew edish is here jonathan mahoney what no graphics is here too shout out to alex vol with the thumbnail as always so wild cart are you is it me or am i completely i could be completely wrong but is it me or has there been absolutely nothing in terms of price rises for the last four or five days no nothing so its not been much to do in terms of jiggling your team around to try and capture those we looked at your team on the wild card on last week and did a stream with ray as well we talk about and you talked a bit more about your wild card you seemed like you werent 100 set on every player there was a suggestion of going without harland now i am very curious as to find out are you going to go ahead with that idea of going no harland and load up in midfield and bring in ole watkins or are you going to hold fast to what youve got or had on your previous draft with harland and salah in your team so well start off with you and then well talk about me im pretty boring my team is pretty much the same ive not done anything to my team but im more interested in knowing what youve done with your team have you got a screenshot of it or do you want to just talk to us about it is in the team screenshots its the one with watkins in its not that difficult to find like three or four up team screenshots discord team screenshots im still adamant on not going holland for three game weeks youre not going holland for three game weeks but with this news of odard rice and various other arsenal players not going to be playing for arsenal for the next week two weeks or whatever im a bit concerned about havs and ive been playing around with various drafts but to be completely honest with you jay i just keep coming back to the no hen draft with what which is which is fleen v rugan robertson rob robertson robinson gavves alexander arold lewis rogers seeno and bremo palmer salah havs one of the brighton two i cant see because its off the screen and watkins okay i keep coming back to it jay i spoke to ry earlier about arsenal assets and he said just avoid them for the next two game weeks he just doesnt know they how they set up but lets get real here sacka is the only player which isnt going to be messed about along with the defenders but were talking from an attacking perspective here i want to go triple liverpool im not too confident on their guaranteed front three apart from salah j and diazs minutes are a bit a bit doy i still think they are the they are the preferred front three theres no question in that but with champions league with the likes of gapo there nunes the other bloke that they brought in not suggesting for them theyre all guaranteed to start versus brenford nottingham forest not brenford nottingham forest and bournemouth and whatnot but like you say a bit of uncertainty of them starting whereas with robertson and trent alexander arnold theyre guaranteed no matter what theyre going to be playing with the likes of watkins i said to ray look fixes build for their upcoming fixures are incredible evertons defense is just theyre nonexistent jes and i think that game against aston villa on saturday i believe it is could be very profitable could be the kickart oe watkins needs to start his season scoring and dont get me wrong haland against brenford im not expecting him not to do anything but i think that theres more upside with the other players returning than there is for their for the replacements that i would have if i had hen so the replacements would be its for instance senor in for robertson diaz in for palmer theyre pretty much the two so and then hland in for watkins and i think that the combination of watkins palmer and robertson the three game weeks is better than haland diaz and daa in this case what do you think i see your logic behind it i think that its a risk certainly is a baller move yes maybe fractionally i can see maybe a slight upside on those three players youre right about diaz hes not guaranteed i think hell play for large parts of a game but hes not guaranteed the 90 minutes i completely agree with that weve got people in big tips in chat saying get sterling and captain god but no i think that theres reasoning behind it which makes sense its a its a strategic threeweek move your captains going to be with salah yes or watkins no right okay so your captain sorted youve got a strong team youre going to have a few differentials from others you may be getting ahead on watkins before anyone else and capturing price rises there if he goes off on one this weekend guarantee hes going to get a 01 or point2 right so i dont think its that risky to be honest i dont think that if you do lose points on it will be vi much at all in fact i wouldnt be surprised if worst case you break even in a weird way barring of course a harand hatrick again which would be just absolutely ridiculous against brenford who are very good and certainly itll be a tough game no i can see your thoughts and im im not going to lie steo i like it and maybe might consider doing something similar but i dont know this team does have i think its one point i havent even changed the team yet im waiting until ray its not saturday morning once all the price because watkins po potentially could be going down again and he wont do but theres a small chance i think hes at 30 at the moment going down by god by friday evening he could he could he could go down to 88 again unlikely all the players that ive got arent going to be going down in price and none of them are going to be going up in price like robertson he aint going to be going up in price can i ask an honest question have you copied fire i copied fire have you have you copied fireo strategy no ive copied fpl olympian and andy martin i had this discussion with ray on the patreon and i had it with him on the stream itself and i just said at the of the day youve got to with this particular game if you want to win you need to attack it and right now i just think that hland going into those three fixtures with renford arsenal newcastle i just think that the players that ive got have got a better opportunity to come through ahead of the other three to be completely frank like we saw n well i did watch it wasnt interested but i one thing i will say one thing i will say is robertson at six million i dont consider him an attacking option anymore purely as a watching him i dont think of him as being the same robertson of two three seasons ago however youre other pick the fact that youve got havitz the fact that you have got havitz and watkins in its it is a tasty team and i think that i think your rotation pairing between fleen and veran is very good like you mentioned as well previous on stream i think your defense is very good got some very good options there okay greaves at 4m who cares about him but robertsons very good fulham you got two big hitters in robertson alexander arold liverpool keeping a clean sheet no doubt about it in my mind lewis question marks but at the moment is i think i think was safe to say hes okay hes safe at the moment may not may not be for the rest of to season but right now hes safe people are ive seen onana from villa being transferred in on mass as well and as a as a as an alternative to rogers is that something that you have thought about or not even not even bothered about well as i said every time i do a wild card ive been doing it regularly quite today specifically based on what ray was saying about just avoid arsenal but once you take that 8m out with have or 81 whatever what strikers are theres no theres no striker in the bracket of sheet where im like im confident with h theres nobody so youve got to look at the likes of welbeck i dont want to be double up doubling up on right attack plus hes gone up to 57 youve then got ive got wck and i got wck and the other one pedro exactly i played around with that but it just meant that my midfield thing gets shot to pieces im keen on palmer jason keen on palmer okay i think that hes gonna be another onei well he didnt he get an assist the other night didnt he get an assist last night wasnt it hes not going to be moving out of that team the front ry made a point about nicholas jackson for coverage of chelsea i just i just prefer palmer and plus my team has got penalty takers palmer and burma salah and also another option i had was i genuinely had palmer saaka and bermo and salah but my front three was just well one of them was just nonexistent i wasnt happy having i think it was watkins and headro as my front i wasnt happy with that at all i want that solid front three the only players in my team that im not particularly overjoyed with seeno havs and rogers baring that im pretty happy with my team i think its there was a consideration for e but listening to f juice and the comedian jim daly hes a crystal palace fan he doesnt think that crystal palace going be pulling up trees but then hes saying that fair to be fair to e he has been very unlucky well theres a against west ham he h the he woodwork didnt he h the wood im pretty sure he hit the woodwork against brenford he came very close from a free kick as well its like i just think that as a for me like there was a question mark like when i was doing the wild card i was thinking to myself do i include him keep him in is dropped down to 69 at the moment but no i think i think hes i think hes a good hes still a pivotal player in that team and i think i keep him but so steve im going to ask the question that you tend to ask and i know you probably expect it what percentage likelihood is this team going to be your team when it comes to game updating saturday morning im about 90 ive been sitting on this team for a while im like 95 if not higher its going to happen unless i hear some news about one of the players is definitely not going to be playing the problem the problem is though jay is im gna be on the motorway when the deadline is going to be approaching so me being back home on saturday by what is it 11 oclock is it 11 by 11 oclock is its going to be very tight the earliest im gna be home is 1030 and thats me pushing it so i reckon im goingon to miss the deadline so im gonna have to do it saturday morning hoping that most of the players that were aware of are going to be fit and ready and available unless mraay was to come out and say nope ole watkins isnt gonna be playing on saturday if i was to hear that its like right im gonna im just h its gonna be hen and hen in and then have some watkins out and whatever i can play with at that point but certainly right now as it stands im about 95 certain im going to be going in with those three games because by the time he gets to game seven and i want to bring hanen back ill be probably taking out its gonna be salah or palmer depending on how they perform over the next three fixures but its probably gonna be salah i think i worked the anywhere i can afford it ill have two free transfers by game week seven i believe it is and im going to need howand back and thats the only thing that makes me want to hold howand is because of the fact that hes probably gonna be i would say 153 by the time he gets the game week seven i think thats how much hes going to be 153 unless by some miracle he drops down in price because he does nothing over the next three game weeks but history against brenford isnt that great jay its not that good at all brenford they not win man city do like playing brenford but its not by high scoring margins i think there was only one anomaly when they won 31 but other than that its all twos hanen could score in fact i think if im predicting now hen gets two goals just the way hes playing at the moment and the way man city are and ray is right the howen captaincy could ruin me but if i can get through it with watkins potentially doing well against everton and salah liverpools form against nottingham forest is very good they like playing nottingham forest especially at home they like playing and the way theyre playing at the moment theyre scoring goals for fun theyre on fire at the moment liverpool so its is gonna be gritting my teeth because ill be doing the 3 pm kickoffs on saturday so anybody listening now im im doing the three because i cant do s well theres no point doing saturday evening because theres a bloody match at 8 o00 so g to do the 3m kickoffs and its going to be through gritty teeth covering those matches because man city and liverpool are playing at the same time and i do expect me to be knowing that hens going to come through with a double digit score but again we can only yes the question the question i want to ask about my team is on the wild cut do i do i have players i rotate on a weekly basis on this case with this coming weekend it be itll be the likes of brian and bumo that i would relegate to the bench in favor of e of all people funny enough whos got a fixture which i like of lester at home so gonna have 45 mid defender in mazeri with faze as well as a chp for leicester but the question i have is if i was to jiggle a couple of players around and not do the rotation and risk carrying points on my bench get rid of umo say bring in for the sake of argument a cheap midfielder okay whats a cheap midfielder in this day and age rogers or maybe onana for for ason villa or who you say winks is 45 no i was thinking of like a five mil which would so like a five mil price point you seeno may no i think onana or probably rogers because i think rogers on penalties and he did well in the under 21s as was mentioned earlier on but lets just say for example i took emo out and brought rogers in and then i could then afford to drop welbeck and pedro out of the team because to be honest with you i look at them and im like do i want to be going with double b attack i could then go i could then go watkins in okay maseri out for greaves and then have 48 attacker so then essentially what it would go from having the likes of maaari and buo on the bench to then having playing watkins in place so let me just let me just give you an example so i would play dunk alexander arnold lewis and probably another defender to do 442 instead of a 343 so where im coming from is if i if i was to do that i would essentially go 442 and have watkins in play watkins and rogers watkins rogers and save greaves or face playing instead of welbeck pedro and e so like for example is so its like in my head its im ra like in my head im like do i want to have players like emo on my bench or e on my bench you are going with hanen and salah arent you yes i am and youre adamant on that yes i am thats the tough decision for you because im choosing for those three game weeks to go against and i could be priced out of hanen by game seven i could be and you sacrificing but then again thats just for watkins whos at the moment hes an unknown like well hes not hes just not hes probably not even matchfit i dont think its that i think that m hasnt he come out and said that he wasnt matchfit hes trying to get up to speed with playing the full 90 and im pretty certain he said that he wants to manage his minutes yes something worse to that effect and like to say fixtures build form and with those three fixtures for watkins or aston villa everton walls and ipswitch im not saying ips switch a rollovers but it builds form jets and if he was to if he was to get say two goals against everton confidence at that point goes into the wolves game who havent exactly been looking sharp and i think that with watkins being the guaranteed starter for aston ville one of the guaranteed sts for rest because thats the problem with ason v you with the defense theres only a few that that are going to play with the champions league coming up theyre gonna be swapping around like m maton id love to be able to own matson id love to own him mate but i cant because hes hes hes a he isnt going a guaranteed to start for thats he definely play the champions league he guaranteed to play the champions league but premier league is just not an option unfortunately and with the news that conors out i dont know who replaces coner in that in that team by accounts it didnt look good according to reports so is there a player that steps up for aston villa thats again another guaranteed stter for at center back and i just i just look at the aston villa fixes and think you cant look at gift ors in the mouth at the moment and when youre on wild card the scary thought is going without hland but its arsenal and newcastle theyre not easy fixes no theyre not easy at all and i even though hanen at the moment is in probably potentially the form of his life and a lot of the big hitters in fpl slash the world of football seem to be specifically in the premier league seem to be doing exceptionally well like sacka salah haland hmer they all seem to be constantly returning this anomaly of just howand and salah returning exact the same points its just absurd it wont continue and i and i sadly do think that haland is probably going to outscore salah this week probably but across the next three expect salah to outscore howand because of the fixtures i cant remember what is salahs third fixture hes got forest bourou and then hes got forest bournemouth wolves away thats right hens got brenford arsenal and then newcastle yes and arsenal enjoy playing man city at the moment last three fixes arsenal have come out on top well they havent i dont think theyve lost the last three is that right arsenal yes they hav lost the last three so i think etta knows how to another fight now i know theyve lost particular individuals that are key to the way arsenal play but i defensively thatre theyre still top in the division and i think theyll nullify hatland i think theyll do theyll do a job against hatland but thats why im not too its going to be scary im not going to lie im not going to sit here in my ms stair room be like ps going to do crap over there of course theres that scary thought but if i get through these next three fixtures with like you stated breaking even or at worst case scenario maybe being 10 points behind or maybe even five or 10 points ahead its just gna be like got i got through it now its full of at home that f at home is another fixture where its triple ccy option possibly and then what is it southampton a few weeks later game week nine triple captaincy option youd be mad not to have him at this at that point but right now i think its just about time just to come off the hanen vanwagon but with someone like yourself thats happy to go with both it just as youve just demonstrated it well the thing is if i was to go off the hen b wagon i can tell you one thing for definite de bruyne will be coming straight in my team okay thats interesting why is that apart from coverage and just having coverage in city i tell you what thats a that when you look at your rivals teams and you like when i look at your wild card i go god youve got hen and salah thats not good the rest of it im like whatever but you saying that if you got rid of hanen and brought in kevin de br ill tell you what that is that is a possible game changer possible game changer hes a big game player as well it would free it would free up an absolute shedload of money i rather have kevin de bruyne than sea fact if i could get to i cant do i may even look do what jaay with what ray was saying getting rid of seeno for kevin de bruyne im gna im gna have a look at later after this stream i may look at that later great its a good sh j a good sh we i could tell i could tell you one thing now is that i could get in mind you saying that diaz again you make a very good point about diaz and uncertainty over starts well not starts but minutes sorry minutes not starts i misspoke im im looking at the team and i dont even like e in my team but like say i was to go right let me just quickly have a look at this here if i was to get that player in talk can you read the chat by the way the chat may or may not be may or may not be saying something right i would have 17 and a half to spend on midfielders so then lets to see what i can get you got rid of han what for watkins no for ive just put havitz in so whos your front three then well pedro welbeck and havitz but i think whos more nailed pedro welbeck right now its well but it would be p theyre both nailed theyre both gu well i was thinking like is there a difference between two im just ripping up my team at thats the only for me im not blown away by strikers are you no i think weve well i know for fact ive missed the boat and th wood i went moon is over wood no ones getting watkins in by the way it seems like what i say thats the point he could he could drop by saturday morning its unlikely but theres a small possibility like for me im just looking at this and the team you can make without harland is t it is it is very tempting how do you get you got to ask yourself you cant because i did that earlier i just rinsed my budget and i was like teams good wait a minute i cant get h back without well without doing without doing some serious but im like looking at like moneywise i wish i could share my screen with you right now because its quite its quite interesting so would i go 352 im tempted welbeck havt watkins salad diaz madai de bruyne my god its like i got i still got 127 to spend name that midfield again hang on let me just fill my midfield out a second because im just so diaz saler alexander arnold i could afford to go to be honest i could get anyone in i could absolutely get anyone in my midfield there i just put rogers in i have 76 for a midfielder steo sorry for a defender 76 for a defender well youve got horo robertson and then you got triple liverpool anyway have you got triple liverpool i got triple liverpool but if i was to get diaz out and do you did i think p personally that could give me 91 91 from mid fielder and whos your midfielders at the moment i tell you now hang on but then if you can id be getting rid of fernandez no come on no if you can get sacka get rid of hs for sacka and then you f i can do that i can do that i can do that striking spot with i couldnt even tell youre right now watkins welbeck and the midfield would be de bruyne madek rogers saaka and salah well if you were plan ill tell you what if you were planning on doing a 352 what does that leave you in the bank with sacka well im just thinking because i could just do a cheape striker and then upgrade rogers but then well i was thinking upgrading medaw if you could potentially get to palmer if its possible well i would have to do whos whos a cheapy striker thats playing at the moment it be 45 wouldnt it so what money have you got left well if i put 45 in and i take mad out id have 91 ah youre 14 five short of armmer see this is what was happening to me earlier but remember you got to remember how do you get hen back in that is it thats why my team it works relatively well because i can do hand in straight swap for free if youre going to spend all your money which is fine but you need i say you need youre gonna want hen back with that full and fixed and that run that run from game week seven on wards is sick and you have made me think about kevin de bruy im going to look at that like i said after this stream im gonna look at that and see how it goes because who are the lots in your team though jam who absolute guarantee no matter what by saturday deadline this player is gonna these players are gonna be im ass locks in my team will be to be fair with you most of them like the only one thats un unlikely well the only question marks ive got in my team are im bremo who im not a massive f like im not massively excited about owning him and maybe e what are you laughing at and burs an absolute key compar to brenford but hes got some very hes got some tough fixtures what to hes got i would even class that west ham at home is i think it be a tough one no brenford theyre very good team theyre not going to wipe him theyre not going to wipe him aside mate well no but again and verma scores goals no tony anymore no tony him and visa him and viser are going to be the two key players for brenford to be scoring the goals and hes on penalties as well their fixtures do turn and i think its from tottenham theyve got decent history versus tottenham as well well read some of the things that the chat saying kdp cooks versus arsenal says big tips its close between harland and salah this week for captain says andrew ferguson arsenal could be without odard says maestro im on the same mind as steo on salo and haren says dan the man so weve got are you going without harland steo says marro and yes the answer is yes potentially good luck could he back could he b a hatrick of hat tricks thatd be very unlikely but possible connor says i ward and tripled up on liverpool players with allison diaz salah liverpools next three fictions are juicy no one has ever done backto back hat tricks before have they well back to back to back you mean hattrick of hattricks i feel like it has been done i cant i cant think of the playoff as from my head if youre think of strikers you think of ronaldo christian ronaldo messi of course the three la the premier league prob probably not no i just mean in general across europe its not the world how many who scored a hatrick of a hatrick of a hatrick it is i dont think its probably in fact even scoring a double hatrick is rare enough er and hollands in a very small elite group of players that have done backtoback hat tricks and to get a triple hat break i think hed be in a group of one with himself im reading this theres no denying that haland is an absolute beast of a map 23 years old isnt he 22 23 seven players have scored seven players have scored three consecutive hattricks in a professional football in england but never has it happened in the premier league and in fact the feat has not been a chief since 1946 worldwide the record for the most successive hat trick stands at five which happened on three occasions at various levels of the game so masashi nakayama scored four hat tricks four hattricks in a row in between the 15th to the 29th of april 1998 in that was in the j league so japan the level of football is different of course but back in 1998 id imagine but joseph ban scored five hattricks in a row in 1939 to 1940 17th of november to 19th of march he also was known to have 5000 goals joseph bishan more goals than ronaldo the air raid was coming over all the goep are running away theres a slight controversy over whether joseph bchans achievement can officially be classified as a record that is because it took place in a wartime league following the outbreak of second world war and it was a clear standard of the league had dropped however two things cant be argued joseph bchan scored five successive hattricks and 19 goals in total in the bohemia and mala league between the november 1989 and march 1940 and two joseph bashan was truly an incredible goal scorer between 1931 and 1957 bychan scored 783 goals in 488 games and another 26 in 33 games at international level nearly every single one of his goals for his club was scored in the top division of either the austrian or czechoslovakian league in 1931 age 17 by chance scored a first half hattrick and four goals in total on his debut for rapid vienna in 1955 age 42 ban played the last league match of his career for dynamo prague he scored four times in that game my god the guy was a beast this is the elite fpl channel everybody were here to talk about the pre post world war i more most well this ones 2016 september 2016 to november 2016 stefan lanik l shanic five hattricks in a row in the croatian football league so lurking in the seventh tier of croatian football playing in a simple stadium of a capacity of 850 fans which is quite formidable for seventh tier nk dra nk drich dakovo may not be a place that you would expect finding record equaling striker but thats what happened in 2016 when stefan luchang bagged a hattrick in the 10n win over enk zinsky dren im sorry i dont i dont know how to pronounce these it gave him five successive hattricks and 20 goals in total of five games its crazy but if theres any austrian f make sure you comment in the video afterwards let us know if this person so only so okay in england top flight frank osborne tottenham in 1925 frank osborne south african born was the first man to achieve this feat back in 1925 osbornes family moved to england 1911 so very long time ago this is the thing about england this is this is the thing about football you can never say that no ones done this or that because its gone back like football goes back so hundreds of years so like someone may have done it and a few players have aned amed ruvan five hattricks in a row in october 2019 ahmad ruvan matched the feats of joseph ban and stefan lanic when he scored five hatch picks in successive games in a duve premier league a top level of malian professional football again standards different from premier league but it has been done in professional football anyway we move on because this we could be all night talking about this about japanese league eight seventh league of god but well just well just talk about we talk about the game shall we lets move on just quickly going back to the wild card all seriousness youre expecting most of those players to be in the team that youve got there its just a few that youre a bit unc youre concerned over thats it well for me its having players that im rotating that are good like for example 7m bremo on the bench this week and then who i bench next week e and then from that its like well hes going to have good fix hes got good fixtures as well like i would say man united at home is a nice fixture for so who do i am i am i benching and bremma again spurs away spurs away come on that could be a tasty one for him so the question is am i weakening my team by having such money on the bench and the answer probably is going to be yes well we saw it with fires team last week too much money on the bench you said it yourself if youre g to go if youre gna say that to fireo then imagine this week youre bening and burma when he gets that obligatory penalty against man city and scs well while es just sat there on two points after drawing with le a one i dont know who never will but its a its a tough decision to make i know a lot of people are probably going to bench in burm anyway i get it but like you say its money on the on the bench and thats why im happy with my wild card team and why im going into the deadline knowing that covering the 3m kickoffs is going to be nail biting but we can get through it we get through it with both hen and salah doing all right itll be then onto the aston villa game hoping that watkins can do where is the evening fixture if you could choose between if you could choose personally between pedro and welbeck would you choose welbeck only because he is guaranteed to start on saturday because of the fact that hes in the country the fact that pedro is on penalties edges it for me but also wellbe to be fair is their is their front management performing very well so in actual fact and answer your question right now id probably go wellbe id go wellbe personally weve got a 44 midfielder steo ive got something thats just transpired where i could play a nonplaying 44 and have a team which is quite formidable would you like to know the dilemma would you like to know the combination chat im about to put it on the screen get ready for this are you ready brace yourselves for an amazing set of transfers here we say goodbye to brian lets go to transfers we say goodbye to brian and bremo we say goodbye to eay we say goodbye are you ready you ready for the next one a nope mazeri we say hello to greaves at 40 whos playing we say hello to franer a nonplaying 44 right and then steo brace yourself we say hello to sacka and we keep our three of pedro welbeck and harland but we now go with a 343 of dun alexander arnold rico lewis madai saka diaz salah as the power four pedro welbeck and harland as the front three that so would mean i would say goodbye to bremo who be my bench fodder that i dont play and i replace him with a nonplaying franer which goes third sub e upgrades to sa sacka and play and plays and nonplaying maseri who i brought him from just to be honest because hes a man united player and i wanted a man player comes gavves comes in for him so a bench player comes in for a bench player a nonplaying bench player in bremo comes in for a nonplaying bench player in franco okay you could argue im weakening my overall squad because ive got a nonplayer but i still have two playing players on the bench and e upgrades to sacka thoughts steo arsenal coverage as well arsenal coverage so be so be dunk alexander arnold rico lewis madai saaka diaz salah pedro welbeck harand with henderson and fabianski in goal me zero money in the bank zero money in the bank ive got exact money to do that lets see what the chat say whos watching this is anyone even watching this than sure and subscribing we are on x tonight i hope you put us on x jam i we are on x but im just worried because i closed the chat that i was using to chat shag says hate it yikes b ive sworn now great fire to our moderators has got me in trouble season over trent to robo franka to rogers welbeck to vissa dont need to do those moves i dont need to i dont need to do that i could go trent to robertson if youre watching on the replay comment on the video below make sure youre doing this i would need to do vissa why would i want vissa in my team i could do rogers so what you guys are liking this more do you like that more to be honest that dont catch you that bad steo whats that that dont look too bad so it would be robertson instead of trent and it would be rogers instead of nonplaying franer but then youre not going to be playing rogers then i no but i can stomach i can stomach not playing rogers at 51 a nonexistent everton defense hes going to be saing on your bench two bright and forwards kills it for me i dont think it does i like the two bright and forward whats that fixes if switch this week and its lester i believe is that right jay say again brightons next fix several fixtures theyre good theyre not too bad attacking perspective no bri brightons fixtures are very nice i think its very puny going with the two brighton assets its there comes risks with it of course but what its not the worst its not the worst shout doing the rogers in and dan green trent to robertson but then rob robinsons not going to get you the output that trents gonna get yous been performing very well but trent is on set pieces and he looks like hes going to be getting a double digit return very soon there is it wouldnt surprise me if it was against nottingham forest mark this book mark this everybody clip it against nottingham forest 12 point coming in for trent alexander ar and then three bonus on top of that 15 points for trent alexander arnold this week hes not in the forest a team that creates lots of chances but cant put the ball in the back of the net only seem to be able to score one liverpool like to play nottingham forest they like to play them a lot jasons looking at getting rid of the thats why i like much robson and trent doubler thats why i like it a lot because with j and diaz again preferred front three but with champions league approaching remember champions league is from next week jet starts next week whatever the format is i dont care it starts next week and this is when were going to learn who the key components are for most teams we know that salah is guaranteed for liverpool we know the likes of hal and kevin de bruyne are a guaranteed to start in both for champions league but walker i think walkers going to be the champions league player and lewis is the premier league apart from the tough games lewis aint going to be playing against arsenal if he does if lewis plays against arsenal then we know on a minute here weve potentially got a manity bargain on our hands potentially and thats why i like your idea of can i get rid of seeno and have kevin de bruyne instead and get rid of havs and bring in whomever i dont know we find out but ill find out after the stream i can do that so i like that like idea the good thing about these discussions is we get to bounce these ideas off and like forget rivalry like at the end of the day we all want to do well at the game we want to do we wanna we w to get as high up of the ranks as we possibly can and lets get real here be nice as we keep saying every year for me and you to do well the game and then it be nice get the people along that want to watch us for tips on a side not just a quick side note everybody make the hell out of our streams i was well i was watching well i wasnt watching i find youtube comments interesting chas i find youtube comments interesting and what ive noticed is that when very popular fpl accounts go on to other channels or vice versa i always find it interesting that the comments that the videos get afterwards just blow my mind that the i dont know the thick difficulty of people that watch fpl content like itll be my god this content is so unique please make more its not that unique its just two people chatting fpl my god i cant believe youre in a studio its amazing i wish more channels did studio based content in a studio its not that unique its not different its just again two bls in the studio i just find it interesting seeing the people that comment and you realize that theres a ginormous market out there of fpl accounts that know nothing of other channels whether youre big or small whether youre small like us or big time like blackbox people there are people that are completely unaware of the content that is that is available and i think that if me and you is my point about when i said at the start of the season i want to go in my gut my gut feeling is go without hand for three games you said it yourself at the start of the season you want to play the game where youre not feeling pressurized you just want to play the game how you want to play and if we have that mindset and stick through it at least at that point when it pays off its hell kevin de bruyer hes come through with a double digit hall here versus arsenal whereas hens done nothing they beat they beat they beat arsenal 20 and kevin de bruyne got a goal and assist and youd be the one that has kevin de bruyne and ive copied you but its true whereas you are theres nothing wrong with asking the chat but then theyre just going to come back with what youve experienced which is go with a popular pcks you just back to template theres nothing wrong with temp nothing wrong with no but no like you and i agree safety in numbers for a lot of people of course theres a reason why 10 plate works but also theres a reason why people like firo dread do so well at this game because theyre picking players which are outside the box and are going against the 10 play well shag put in the chat cant you just take a risk on no harand for the three game weeks and get him on game week seven you can still get you can still captain salah up to game we seven means you can spread funds up to that game week well thats exactly what steo is doing well seems to be doing anyway but you are completely right you can absolutely go without harland and like i mentioned earlier on you could put de bruyer in and have a bit of that attacking coverage that pick is you think how unlucky you were with the bruyne versus my god i felt sick i felt sick watching the highlights didnt i you saw my face watching the highlights it was just like it was torture because he was absolutely doing the business he looks very in form he looks fit he looks like hes going to score like most times that hes in front of a goal so can we get on with the predictions because i know were youve got everything in front of you so you can carry on with it but we got our super brew everybody and while im here just to let people know our patreon is now live so if you want to support the show financially youre more than welcome to just go to patreon and ty an elite fbl and theres two tiers one 99 tier just to say thank you for me and jason for what we do and then theres the 499 tier which gets you

sure that you are liking and subscribing if youre brand new around all you people on x make sure youre jumping over to youtube say hi say hi to jason the only one with the technology lets lets crack on james with our predictions for game week four im still messing around my team this im just looking at this and thinking what i could do this i could do that i could do this i could do that and its like my god like theres so much choice is that without holland this is the thing but youve got to keep in your mind jess how do i get back in for game s he will tear it up against foot unless he drops off form so dramatically that wait a minute im glad i havent got him im just im just looking at this and im thinking this like who are the best defenders theres not amazing there not an amazing choice for me defender wise well its liverpool arsenal to start with easily and then id argue youd then be looking at potentially brenford with their upcoming fixtures you then have we could laugh but someone like potentially someone like crystal palace they got a decent upcoming run of fixtures but there are teams there jas you can choose from i just i again this whole this whole no harland it entices you toit to mix up the rest of your team because you free up so much money but it makes you feel to spend all the money yes thats how you feel and thats what i fell into the trap of when i saka palmer salah and someone else who ive completely forgotten about its frightening what you can do but it means that you cant it is frightening what you can do it is and like you could even and this might be controversial this might be controversial but you could even bring in bernardo silva no now that is that is strong okay i was being sarcastic right lets move on to the lets move on to the the games shall we lets take this seriously lets take the stream seriously for a change let me just find where the chats gone because i dont see it anywhere and all these 3m kickoffs saturday everybody great to see lots of you supporting the channel 3m kickoffs 3m on saturday 3 p pm on saturday get yourself here well be well steo will be watching the game 120 people watching which is incredible hello to everybody i can see the chat again now evening nick from f juices here hello nick hows it going guys cra is the best defender in the world says russ morgan in the chat froden is 10 years younger for the same price would rather have legs over de bruynes legs says alexander mcbrien in the chat theyre still looking at anyway im im not touching my team i dont think tonight to be honest man its just its over its its frying my brain frying my brain okay so south southampton versus man utd steo southampton v man united i am going to go with a 21 win for man utd of course i am because im biased st your thoughts on this game southampton man united southampton at home of course its on tnt sports you gonna watch it no what i will say though is that am i right in saying man united seem to be better away from home than they are at home historically yes thats right i think man united come away with the clean sheating this cant score theyre useless theyll be a typical possession based football man united will take advantage of it and im going to go with i was thinking oneil ill go ill go two nil because of the quality i think gach has got a start hasnt he well ive been saying that for a while but nothing brighton versus zp switch two one to brighton im going to go 31 to brighton 31 to brighton even s are defensively not as bad as what people are making out its just can they cope with the intensity of the premier league team thats what it seems to have been cting them out just the fact that this the premier league fitness levels i think they do all right and then they just seem to fade off and thats when theyre caught out and i expect i think brighton should be winning this i dont think theyre going to score three im going to go im gonna go two1 jay is thats the first 3 pm isnt it or one of the three its its one of the 3 pms which steo will be covering crystal palace versus leicester with e on my team at the moment as it stands i think crystal palace has got enough in them to just to win this by a goal margin im going to go 21 to crystal palace we talking of leester james vardy j at 56m i was looking to maybe fit him in genuinely guaranteed for leicester they got some decent rolling back the years steo rolling back the years well as dan says i generally think that honestly that he could be an option for you jaay at 56 but how do you fit him in with the quality of players youve got already crystal palace it be one it be one of the brighton boys out wouldnt it but no its not happening thats the thing i think like you say im stay in the bloody obvious crystal pal should be winning this struggling to score goals though theyre struggling i think potentially jake this could be a shock result in the sense of leer could get something here i think on super brew im probably gonna go 21 im gonna bold im gonna bold the state now that leicester could get a one1 draw okay one1 draw says steo fulham versus west ham a derby game of epic proportions its going to be this is a im not too sure how this ones going to go i can see one all i could see 21 either way im going to go with fulham 21 another 21 prediction f another team who ive seen them a couple of times ive just not been particularly impressed by them at all and moon is absolute wast is all right hes done okay by all accounts fad in and out of games you can tell hes got quality about him theres no denying it against west ham though west versus east its a big old journey for west h to get there i know that for facts so im gonna go with quicker to take a flight in it well you get a flight from stan said to he from the piad diddy line down to hammersmith and you could walk the 20 minute you are right could you imagine that for could you imagine that in this day and age for your carbon foot print we flew for five minutes right so i think west have got i think west ham have got the better quality even though f up good at home col if youre watching im gna go with west ham to nichas 21 up next weve got one of the spicier one of the two spicy 3 pms we got liverpool versus nottingham forest in a game where i fully expect liverpool to just dominate i think not only will have their chances but i think its going to be two or two nil to liverpool in this game maybe even three thoughts st i looked at the history for man city and liverpool over the next three fixtures and liverpools history versus the lights of night forest warmouth especially are very good at home there lots of three nils four nils things like that versus the two respective teams and i think liverpool its going to sound ridiculous but i have this feeling that not for a score but liverpool come out and win 31 31 31 i can already he writing so why if you got liverpool double defense well im gonna go 31 jam man city versus brenford is the next game thats on the list here i would expect man city to just do a professional job i dont think its going to be two three four goals i think its just going to be a two you heard twonil win for man city 2nil to have harland or not question i dont think harand scores both but i think he will be involved in at least one goal in this game man city 2 brenford nil steo im going an extra goal im gonna go three even though the history genuinely from what i remember it was just two nils two ons to man city even theres the odd game here there brenford have come out on top think the last time they played each other last season i think man city won 31 but i think that was a way i could be wrong there but im sure its 31 to man city either way im gonna go three nil and hen i think he gets two jay i fear that i think hen captain has come out on top this week annoyingly and ill be but thats but thats part of your threeweek plan is that hopefully over the three weeks youre over the absolutely aston villa versus everton i think everton are and i think aston villa are going to get a win here home team again to win wally watkins could it be the game where he goes back up to 9m i think i think aston villa to win this one nil one nil just one n say that im again im certain of saw of the history suggesting a lowscoring game and ask i dont think i dont i dont think its going to be more than one i think because of evertons depleted defense im gonna go with aston villa to take advantage and im gonna go with i think as i dont know why aston villa always seem to concede im gonna go 21 to ason villa whos going to score cal le l mcneil theyve got l bournemouth versus chelsea steo you go first well ive got some menu in this game i think im gonna be play i think ive got him playing i cant remember now think if i have him or not but i think this is going to be a high scoring game its based on absolutely nothing j they bournemouth they seem have figh in them they play went against newcastle they get a 33 draw no 22 no they beat everton 32 i think this is gonna be another 32 im gonna go for chelsea im gonna go 32 to chelsea i think this is gonna be a entertaining high scoring game eight oclock isnt it i dont know why theyve chosen that game i wonder if dan will be watching it by the way dan its 40 today happy birthday dan remember that jay wow sing song come on happy birthday to dan 40 okay give me give me a moment and ill sing him a song well no we sing together cant we st well no you can sing let me just hum the song and you can sing over its simple god happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear d boy happy to everybody in chat wish d happy birthday there we go happy birthday dad you go to the bournemouth game and then rays 40 next week two people in the 40s not im not singing another one for ray but no lets move on to spurs versus arsenal spurs arsenal a fixture thats 2 o fixture spurs arsenal spurs i think spurs wont be an easy one for arsenal i think this could be a 22 im gonna go 22 wow yes weve discussed that arsenal have got several key players out and this is tottenhams opportunity to take advantage tottenham are very good at home even though they score i believe again i could be wrong but im pretty certain last season they scored less goals at home than they did away against arsenal they hate playing arsenal lov playing tottenham i think arsenal i still think theyve got the edge and im gonna go with ray and dan the two 40 year olds and im gonna go with arsenal to win this 21 okay the aa teams win 21 and finally the wolves versus newcastle game at half past 4 has anyone got anyone in this playing in this game anyone got any newcastle players left anyone got isaac anyone got any anyone from newcastle anyone no dont all put your hands up steo whats your thoughts on this im do you want me to go first you want to go first ill go first you got to start it off relatively they played well but they that i think that 62 hammering by chelsea was an anomaly theyre up against the newcastle team who by all accounts in the in the behind the scenes jay is not looking rosy people arent particularly happy and i think that again im sure the history is a regular nil one1 and im not ive not been impressed by newcastle acc all jaay and i think im going to do that im going to go one im going to go 11 jace 11 i think i think im going to give newcastle the win here im going to go 21 to newcastle just i think they will start kicking gear and i think isaac is going to score in this game and make managers rethink maybe a good performance from new castle a way molu could swing the other way around it could be wolves that come away with a 21 win but i think im going to go 21 newcastle what a what a game to have at 430 i get the fact thatal local derby but come on why is that not at 430 its not riveting lets be honest with you i think ill be in my car driving then back to deon in car in the car in my ms car bloom do do that meem im afraid i dont know ill share it on social media later for those who dont know its before its before its before the

3,elitefpl,r3VkzwaZnSE,FPL GAMEWEEK 4 WILDCARD DRAFT | THE BIG DEBATE With @ReyQuraishi  | Fantasy Premier League 2024/25,2024-09-05T21:10:41Z,a impromptu I guess live stream uh discussing all things wild card there's a specific reason why myself and rare doing this because anybody that is a patreon member will be aware of an hour and a half discussion me and Ry had basically talking about M wild card and I said to Ry afterwards I'm like why aren't we doing this on a live stream we should have done this as a live stream because I think it would be more beneficial to the channel from a from a self point of view so good morning Ry good morning steo how are you I'm I'm I'm all good I've got an hour before work so we got a quick say rush through it we're g to have an hour of discussion about all this because me and you have been chatting since that patreon podcast regarding the factors of having Salah having no Salah having hen having no hen or having both essentially is this now in my specific team which uh you saw the other day within reason we were both in agreement that we're happy with the picks that I've gone with this just the odd one here or there you weren't particularly happy with the wild card that I kind of want to do I'll be showing people in a minute but I'm going to put up on screen now my team which is their the wild card team right now and basically we've got the braning go Lewis DEA Trent Rogers Diaz Salah seeno htz Pedro and Holland and then on the sub bench we have got fleen because it's going to be that rotation pairing of fleen and foran and [ __ ] Robinson and Greaves of ipswitch so my concerns with this specific team I say concerns players that I'm really not particularly interested in specific Al for the next three game weeks and I must make this clear this is for the ne this is this wild card is essentially before I get hen back is for the next three game weeks so game weeks four five and six I don't want this team I want the majority of it I'm not going to lie the majority of this team is going to be staying as it is the team that I want for for myself personally is going to be the one that I'm putting up on screen now Ray which is going to be no hland whatsoever it's going to have zero hland but what it will have is Palmer Watkins and Robertson instead so I'm going to put that up on screen now there we are all is Glory I wonder if that's going to become even better for the audience yep there it is so essentially instead of hland someone else who I've completely forgotten about oh Diaz and Dena I've got Robertson Palmer and Watkins for the next three game weeks those specific fixtures for anybody listening on audio in fact Ry you could probably tell me because I haven't even got the fbl site up on my screen would you believe but certainly I do know that the fixtures for Aston Villa are very very good I know that the going against Palmer is something which I I think I'm going to potentially regret because I think Palmer is fixture proof and double Liverpool defense I think for these fixtures that they've got up coming knock Forest Bournemouth walls Crystal Palace in my opinion are just I think they're they're gold dust and with man City's fixtures of brenford Arsenal Newcastle for these next three I don't I I per I personally think from A Team stand point I'll do better with this team with Watkins Palmer and Robertson over what you're going to be suggesting which is hen in this team and then it obviously that comes at a detriment to x y and Zed players so do you want to just talk us through your thought processes regarding having firstly having hen in the team yeah I think a lot covers the week against the game against brenford where he'll be the most Captain player and I fully expect him to at least get one return so I can see your thinking in regards to not having him but I just feel like you know harland's e EO will be so unreal probably 160 170% that any return that he does get it's probably going to plummet you quite a bit and at the moment the ranks are pretty close and I don't feel like it's worth not having him at all actually for your short-term gain because what could happen not necessarily with you is that I think a lot of people hit the ward button because they didn't have Holland so you know you're taking him out now to put him back in meaning that you're kind of coining in transfers and if you have an injury here or there there might be a little bit of a delay to bring in or you might have to take some hits so personally I think you could still and I'm sure we'll go through it because I sent you a couple of drafts but you know I think having Harland in you can still create an excellent Squad going forward where you have him and Salah but I know you're specifically thinking harand so to be honest with you steo I think I said to you is that even though he's not the best captain for the next three game weeks if you if you just build it all as you know three game games but I still expect him to get a minimum of two goals and if he gets a minimum of two goals then people are obviously going to Captain him against brenford and I wouldn't be surprised if they Captain him against Newcastle even though I did say to you the other day I think Newcastle are more defensive again is I'm unsure it's worth the risk and that's the word really I think it's risky to not have him so yeah that's kind of my assessment what are your thoughts thing is I look at the overall picture to be honest with you regarding the probability of returns from haland Diaz the likes of DEA versus the very very very high potential of Watkins Palmer and Robertson so with Liverpool for instance I the way they are playing at the moment they don't look like they're going to concede a goal forever not literally but you know what I mean but it' probably be ironic now that they're going to concede to a team in Nottingham Forest who never can never create a goal scoring opportunity whatsoever but the two Liverpool fixtures upcoming at home with not forest and bourma bearing in mind these are coming in after International fixtures and reading a couple of X accounts which I respect a lot in Andy mine and this guy called FPL Olympian they make some excellent points regarding going no hen certainly for the next three game weeks mainly because of the opposition but there are other circumstances surrounding some of the International Players which are a bit concerning that regarding whether they start or not so Diaz is a prime example of somebody who with the Champions League upcoming in as well there's a possibility that he may not start the game against Notting Forest we know hen's going to be starting every single game I know he's not a rotation risk whatsoever but the upside to not owning haland in these three fixtures is that with the likes of olle Watkins who yeah as I can see I I know there's people in the chat saying here about this Watkins are wait and see but I find that but I find that the three fixtures for Watkins outweighs hland so Everton rules IP switch Aston Villa have a very very very good chance of winning these next three quite comfortably you then have Chelsea with B withth West Ham admittedly both away and then Brighton at home Chelsea is scoring goals for fun a fact tricker lips was making a point about the fact that Chelsea are one of the highest since the turn of the year they're they're one of the highest scoring teams in the in in the Premier League and then you've got with like I said with Liverpool the way they're defending at the moment and Performing really really well they've got three fixtures of which are against three teams which don't score that many goals and I think that they should they should be keeping two clean sheets in the next three in my opinion whereas like I said with Diaz potentially being a rotation risk over the next three or four fixtures with the competition from the likes of gapo as an example just as a simple example and there's other players as well that can be coming in with man city regarding captaincy you are right like howand is going to the most cap Captain player against brenford I'm not going to sit and pretend he's not full Liverpool's history against Nottingham Forest at home is just incredible man City's history against brenford to be completely Frank is [ __ ] their history against Arsenal over the last few fixtures has been terrible Newcastle it's not really been that great in fact I did a tiny bit of research and just going on literally the last two fixures and I don't mean Premier League I just mean all fixures in general hen's record against brenford Arsenal Newcastle isn't that great not that great against brenford not too bad but against Arsenal and Newcastle in the last two fixes again not necessarily premier league but he started them both he hasn't scored he's not done well at all and even though your argument for the fact that hen's ownership and effective ownership and all that is going to be skyrocketing you are completely right this is over the next three game weeks Ray sure I'll have Salah as Captain versus Notting Forest against Bournemouth and then there's a question mark regarding who to Captain game week six when it comes to whether it could be away at walls it could be potentially Watkins away at ipswitch it could even be you know yeah Palmer in a high-scoring game against Brighton and when gameweek seven comes around it's simple Ray I get rid of howand see you later mate he's gone and then there's a no no no no sorry I bring back yeah I bring back howand in gameweek seven easy I can I can do it I can do it with no price worries whatsoever I can then potentially potentially then get rid of Palmer and then I can bring in a another possible ability of a premium asset in for argument sake even it could even be Liverpool it could even be Salah in in in bringing in Sack or something by attacking the uh Arsenal Fixtures from game week seven where it's Sav Hampton at home Bournemouth away and then onto a couple of difficult fixtures in Liverpool at home and then Newcastle away but to be honest with you again I think Arsenal like man city like Liverpool ironically are actually all three of them are fixture proof so yeah just let's just see a couple of comments here um Andrew Griffith saying Diaz and jot won't play Bournemouth I I went I want to Wild Card Dom Junes saying but I don't think we have enough information how things will be in the next couple of couple of weeks well that's why you hit the Wild Card you just bring in a team of players that you really really want and then whatever information comes out comes out but to be honest with you I can't see anything changing in the next it's not even two weeks it's what Ray we've got less than a we've got just over a week yeah it's Thursday today and then we've got the Internationals on Saturday and Tuesday and Wednesday and then it's just back to reality so I don't have a problem with the information we got the information we've got at the moment are the fact that Arsenal are doing really really well at the moment Aston Villa are just plugging along with what they do the only downside to ason Ville is that Watkins isn't particularly performing at the moment like of Chelsea they're just sporadic at the moment but they're scoring goals for fun Fulham I think have disappointed me personally you then have the teams that were promoted are all doing what we expected which is basically [ __ ] Liverpool and Man City are just plooding along as expected in fact I'd argue that man city specifically hland is doing a hell of a lot better than anybody even expected and I would argue that that's the same with Salah as well man united well they're an absolute sack of [ __ ] Spurs I think Spurs the team that people need to be kind of like wanting to be reassessing and yeah I I think for me the the team that I've got here with Watkins Palmer and Robertson has got a better balance in my opinion than with the team where I've got on screen now with Holland and Diaz I've got the two premium Defenders and I mean even then Robertson could turn into a Gabrielle celba you then have which which is similar pricing anyway Diaz becomes a player in which is a guaranteed starter for Chelsea no matter what and in a Chelsea team that scores goals and then Watkins he's got the fixtures Ray he's he's got the fixtures yeah so I think from nonh Harland perspective I think it's a really really really good squad and you know I think and you know again with the drafts I've sent you one with a three meum and one with a tum however you want to say it is you want you want options on the squad you know you don't want everything on the 11 especially on a walk card and I think what you've done is you've built a really well-rounded Squad to take you through the next three game weeks so there's a there's an argument on the side of not going Harland from what you're saying absolutely and it does make sense so you know I'm not going to just stand on my side and say no no no you got to have harand I believe you must have Harland but if you're not going to have it I can understand your perspective however harand scored seven goals in in in three matches it's absolutely unbelievable and you want to put it past him getting another hattick against against brenford I know what you're saying about the history absolutely but he looks really different like he he really does look fresh he he looks at it and he's just getting better he's only 22 23 years old he's it's unbelievable what Holland's doing it's just unbelievable so I just am concerned for you that if and when he does get that Hall over the next three weeks hey it could be against Arsenal who knows the way he's playing and the way man city are playing I don't believe so obviously but against Newcastle it could potentially happen is that I am concerned that you're you know you're you're you're facing against a mountain and you're really hoping your other players that you haven't captained okay you're going to Captain Salah but the other players you haven't captained need to somehow cover those Haring points and I'm unsure how worth it it is but go ahead so you don't thinking logically B Bas on the fact that what we've seen from the premium assets including sacka so sacka Palmer Salah in fact look at it here the there's so many of them well this is the point this is why it's so ridiculous is that work so the top scoring players so far this season in FPL Salah premium Palmer premium sacka premi premium so three of the top four are premium based players within the game itself you then have Diaz who plays for a premium team in Liverpool you then have Sun who plays for a premium team mea wacky whatever you may think plays for Chelsea at the end of the day the only the only um anomaly here is in Burma however the information that we've had over the few years that we've seen brenford without Tony is that ambero steps up and does really really well yeah of the fixes that umo's had are we surprised that he's there in the top five no not particularly and I think that certainly moving forward with like I said with these fixtures because what I was going to say is do you seriously think that for argument sake with my in fact let's just bring up one of your teams that you sent me perfect so we'll go with the thrum as you've called it so we'll go with the thrum so the freemium you sent me was as follows you had Salah Palmer and haland so it was veran and go conza Trent Dan well we can I'm telling you now I'm not having Dan bur I'm not having Newcastle in my team so he can clear off Salah Palmer seeno Rogers brilliant in fact this this I'm not going to sit and pretend it's not this this team is beautiful it's pretty much exactly the same team as what I've got the only differences is it's just the bench and then you got Pedro howand and havs when I saw this team this morning barring Dan burn which made me sick in my mouth I I really like it because we then got Robinson yeah Robinson FAS can be gaves I'm not having any Lester in my team Winks yeah he can continue as he is and then fabianski who looks like he could be the only downside to this team of course is that we're only talking and there's nothing wrong with this one goalkeeper and that goalkeeper being I think I probably would go down the route with having the the Brighton asset because of the simple fact that that they have got the better fixtures over the next two for definite but fleen seems to be a save points magnet we don't know now the Bran's been told that he's first choice we don't know how he's going to perform but whatever at the end of the day he's playing for Brighton he's going to do well no matter what the same as brenford I put Brighton brenford in the same category teams to be honest with you I don't mean in the the way they play I just mean they're going to be there or there about in the same positions in the league bright Brighton's opening next few fixtures zip switch nothing for us Chelsea Tottenham Newcastle wolves Liverpool they're not that particularly great whereas with brenford they've got Man City Tottenham West Ham wolves man united I switch Fulham i' i' personally argue fleen has got the better opponents hence why I like the the Brighton brenford rotation I think that's not quite necessity for me but I I do like the fact that I would have the option to have oh I've got veran at home to ipwi I've then got veran at home to the next opponents have completely forgotten a not in forest and then I can then jump on to brenford where they've got West Ham wolves Man United and then after the Man United game I can then go on to the bran with with with Wolves but we we're we're literally splitting head with that but that team there ra you want to just talk us through your reasonings behind I get the whole Palmer and all the premiums but Dan burn was it just you putting a 4.5 defender in there for the sake of it yeah I mean he could easily be dunk and theug be flecken isn't it I mean there's it's it's price point it's more of a price point team maybe I mean burn is there like you said for the sake of it but I think the so on paper I I absolutely adore the 11 in in in in total I I think I did a solid job fitting all the kind of viable and attractive assets into the team the problem is is that that bench is really crap because you're going to have winks that you're never really going to play fast or that four basically the four million Defender you're going to be relying them at some point and they're going to be a lot of instances where it's probably going to be a 442 formation simply because of the fixtures with your other players like for example havs away at Man City I don't like the game and even SE meno away to Liverpool okay he could actually do something because I don't think Liverpool are as defensively solid as you do but you're going to be relying too much on these budget enabling players every single week to compensate having Haren Palmer Palmer Salah and Trent so are you referring to this team yeah yeah the one I've I've been the Thum team the other team I definitely want us to go through as well is that this was more of you were telling me that Palmer's a player you do worry not having and I'm like okay well let me play around and see if I can fit something in but you're relying on a player like Rogers who's unproven Seno you know we still got to wait a bit longer how much will be that Talisman at the sank is there not there anymore you know every week like havit is not a consistently proven FPL asset Xiao Pedro what next week will look like but surely as an Arsenal fan you must agree that he's been performing very well for you and he's clear the per brilliantly but but against Spurs I expect him to play in Midfield who would be the front three then I think it will be Sterling sacka and trossard I think you mad R I'm sorry I cannot see artetta dropping havs back in Midfield I know yeah then again you got no Dean Rice have you yeah we don't have rice and Marino and I don't think he'll play party and georgino will'll get outrun havit is in there to be an engine honestly Sterling I think there's more chance of Martinelli being played through the middle alongside Trad and sacka than Sterling being thrown in okay personally I mean I don't know anything but no you do no you make no you make a you make a compelling point but okay but I think havs will play in Midfield that's my prediction however I'd still have him in the team like he'd be the Arsenal asset I go for so because you're quite right he's been fantastic as I kind of expected him to be actually so but again is a lot of these players are kind of like you know Xiao Pedro for Brighton again I think we we I've said this a lot of times apart from matoma and burn uh not burn matoma and dunk I think they're the only two nailed players in the whole team at the moment steo enjoy Jia Pedra as we as much as we can but I wouldn't be surprised if he's randomly benched if he's benched against ipswitch or forest with this squad the draft I've given you you're relying on a Harry Winks or or or you know your ips switch Defender let's just say John well someone else this is why I love my team regarding the non-hand now admitt we're talking about a team with howand but the non-hand draft I'm not relying on these players right I'm relying on for instance if and when and bermo coming off the bench if Pedro doesn't play a minute against dip switch if if I feel that obviously Pedro was called up to Brazil at some point yesterday and and he's back quite late yeah so we going to get news no matter what if Pedro is going to be starting and and the Brighton manager has come out and basically said words to the effect of Pedro's amazing for my team and the way we play Pedro is the main man and that that breeds confidence but like you've just said he comes back late for Brazil if for argument sake he doesn't feel like he's up to it I can easily play in bermo in this in this thre but I call it a forum because you've got Trent Alexander Arnold in there I'm then going oh do I play Rob I'd probably play Robinson let's just say Pedro was ruled out he'd be like oh I'd play Robinson ahead of Pedro for instance and like you say with this specific team it's it's too heavily relyant on your cheapy players Plus in Midfield like you quite righty say even though in my Watkins team I've still got seanu and roders I could easily if I really want to play on Burma ahead of Rogers but this is the kind of game where you will thinking no steo you want to be at least playing Rogers in that one fixture at home to Everton at least give him that opportunity but your next team that you brought up which is only the freemium at this point hland Salah and and Trent it's a lot more balanced by far Yeah by far it's a lot more balanced by far and it is as follows we're going withing goal again coner Trent Robinson there's a theme Here Salah matoma Seena Rogers Nicholas Jackson haland HTS and then fabianski Adams I who is Adams it's Adam full oh D try right okay th and poro and five in the bank just thought i' put said that and five in the bank as well now I personally hate leaving premium team Defenders on the bench I'd be playing poro no matter what okay I don't care I'd be playing him over Robinson I'm telling you that for free so I hate benching premium team Defenders but this team here I was going to say J then this team here Ray is like you say a lot more well balanced like you said you you've got 0 five in the bank which for me I'd upgrade fabianski to fleen that's what I would do I just want to use all my money and it means really at this point your team is now absolutely perfect in fact um so if that's 0.5 because tra race five million is that right yeah I think his incredible value at five million so five million there we then in this in this team here I would upgrade Fe to not even upgrade I'd just drop him down to to grieve so that gives us 0.6 Ray in the bank think about that we've got the Aston Villa coverage in kza defense and Rogers in attack Trent who I love Robinson brilliant player for Fulham very very attacking but he beber plays with poro it doesn't really matter we still got we still got Robinson in the team Salah matoma is the possible one where he may not even be able to start again against dip Swit because of the fact he's on International Duty playing with Japan small possibility that the manager make come out and say sorry he's not ready for this game possibility you've then got the coverage in Chelsea with Nicholas Jackson who's got zero well he's got competition but he looks like he's going to be the main stay up top for now he has he's done nothing wrong so he's the main stay this team here I must admit Ray I I I really like do you want to go through your thoughts with this this particular team and why you went with it yeah so I created multiple drafts for yourself but other people as well I was I was saying to you that you know I still get DMS which is great so I'm still involved in in a consultancy role haven't you the word today and I just like this because every week There's a balance you know every week there are options you know maybe the only weak one is gaves but everyone else could play every single week and you're quite right if matoma comes back from Japan a day before and you're bit like I don't know if I want to play him okay I'll put in Adam a tror HTS away to Man City bad game on paper you might think you know what I'll bench him I'll play Adam atreo I'll play Pedro I'll play Robinson I'll go 442 I think there's so much movement that you have in this team and I think another key point which I didn't really mention before is you got the price points in pretty much every position isn't it you got the most expensive midfielder you got the most expensive Striker and I look at a Jackson and I think Jackson is not a season keeper Jackson is a okay I hope he plays these next three or four games and assess it from there I look at him he's got Bournemouth West Ham Brighton and Forest in his next four games I would be very surprised if he doesn't start at least three of those because like I said in the last stream he's the only actual Target man in essence in air quotes I use that very Loosely that term that Chelsea have and a lot of the times in the in the three games that they played is that Jackson does find himself he's got fantastic movement for frontman like he he's in great positions he's just not a great finisher however I still expect him to get a couple of goals over the next two three games and I also thought to myself why I think this draft is so much better than the other one I sent you is because it's a lot of money to have Palmer and you're not going to cap him and I'm just thinking look get an asset who at the moment is playing who's in form who seems to be trusted even from last season as well Nico Jackson started most of the games is that I just feel like that's probably the question mark in this team the reason I went with matoma and not Pedro is because I didn't know which Chelsea I said to bring in I think what your your current team lacks is you don't have a Chelsea player and I feel that you need to have an attacker and the only other player I can think of apart from Palmer is Jackson Steven now he could be look I won't be surp look mesa's got 48 players I wouldn't be surprised that Nico Jackson has a crap game against Bournemouth a game I don't think they'll win by the way he could have a crap game against Bournemouth and it's like you know what against West Ham I'll play Xiao Felix yeah it can absolutely happen but with the way he's playing and his XG is you know I I I just think it's uh it's it's it's a worthwhile punt so yeah those are my thoughts in regards to the rest of the team quite right you can make I Ani into fleen as you rightly said Robinson could be dunk if you want triple brenford uh Brighton excuse me but I think the rest of it is you know pretty well balanced I like the porro shout because I think I said to you the other day but very briefly is even though Spurs were just a pile of crap against Newcastle Pedro good have got assists they hit the bar his average position is ridiculous he plays as a Winger steo and and you know if you want Tottenham coverage which I actually Advocate having Spurs coverage is you know against Arsenal they'll create opportunities the way they play against brenford against man united then you know they got Brighton West Ham these are good fixtures for porro in my opinion from an offensive point of view that hey why not tap into it if you got the budget so yeah D saying do you have full faith in Palmer doing well steo because that premium has taken a ton of your budget that could be spent improving players like seenu and getting E I have a lot of faith in Palmer what does he need to prove what what what what did he do last season he scored God knows how many goals got how many assists and now he's surrounded by even better players is pretty much going to be the key component to Chelsea this year definitely I I I think that he's for me I just want him and that's just him as a man so I I I really like Palmer I think he's absolutely brilliant but Ray's case regarding Nico Jackson just to that Chelsea coverage and the fact that you won't be that I won't be captain in Palmer even though I expect Palmer to outs School Jackson that's how I see it Ray just players are going to be outscoring one another rather than worrying about the captaincy but like you say in negates away from other players in your team that are better than say the likes of seeno Alexander mcbrien saying Trent is a nogo for me look at his performance so far you're only playing 7 million for clean sheet for a premium Defender way expecting to get attack and returns again based on history Trent Alexander Arnold is an individual who will over the next few game weeks score a double digit Hall it's there it's coming and I I mean you've G him in your Telegraph game haven't you Ray who's that sorry Trent Alexander on yeah absolutely I I I think I think personally Alexander that a is imminent because he is picking up great positions he got his goal the other day right Philly offside but obviously it was gutting and I just feel with those fixtures against forest and Bournemouth I me they're just going to be camped in the half and and Trent's average position is going to be insane and I think it's imminent he'll get a return in the next two games I look I look at Trent and think you need to have him in your wild draft I think you need to have him in your team and yeah quite rightfully so Telegraph steo I am looking to bring in Salah but it won't be at the sacrifice of Trent I think Trent over the next five matches you know Forest Bournemouth wolves Palace Chelsea I can see two three attacking returns honestly Dom saying is uh well he's making a statement Ry essential on a wild card your goalkeeper Ray literally your goalkeeper for Arsenal what do you think on Ry uh I think no those those fixtures are are tough I'd rather go for Defender and then bench him for the next two I know you don't like that b rathera go for a premium Defender B rathera go for a CBA benim and then in game week six you got a real nice run of three fixtures now about Arsenal quickly is you can't really ignore that despite the fact that from game week six to eight we got nice fixtures we then got Liverpool Newcastle Chelsea away so I don't think there's a priority to bring in Arsenal defensive assets but I never considered an Arsenal defender in any of the drafts that I made for steo like never I just thought havit is enough there's a lot of people watching right now make sure you are hitting the like button and of course if you are brand new around here and you're enjoying the content myself Jason and Ray bring you please make sure you are subscribing to the channel so involving the chat here let's get a a a poll not even a poll a live a live one here right now chat this team in front of you is the one that I'm feeling I'm probably going to end up going with on Wild Card we've got the rotation around fleen and V rugan it will be Robertson at Trent along with whoever's got the better fixture out of Lewis and Robinson a Midfield four of Palmer Salah and bermo and then one of seeno or Rogers and then a front three of havs Pedro and Watkins this is for three game weeks only I should clarify this is for three game weeks only so bearing in mind that hen's fixtures aren't that great this is for three game weeks only so it be Robertson Trent lewi for argument sake and burm OA Salah seeno htz Pedro and Watkins what do you think on this three game we team chat what do you think on this three game we team very interested to know what this is uh what people think about now um because I like I like this team Ray it's got a lot of a lot of balance to it um I find that it's got the coverage for all the big hitters um especially with han man City's tough fixtures I think the Newcastle game is going to be really difficult for them I expect them to win I think Newcastle would have turned it around by them but you are right they are a lot more defensive than what they should be um so yeah it' be interested to see what the um the chat say Dale saying I want to stay above you you're only above me by a couple of points Dale and you've already used triple captaincy as well so so it's not it's not particularly great Andrew G Andrew Griffith saying this is seven out of 10 that's that's that's that's good to hear no one else can to be bothered to rate it Ray so we'll move on to yours see if people can be bothered to rate your one so then we move on to the the the team which hasn't got much balance at all regarding the the subs bench but certainly has got a good team on paper so in goal conza Trent Dan burn but this is more of a wild card for Beyond three game weeks Salah Palmer Seena Rogers hedro halan HT and then just not necessarily bench fodder but certainly players in and this is zero in the bank I'm assuming Ray yeah this is this is I don't actually like this draft I I just wanted to show you it can be done but it's just you yeah you're looking you're you're Barrel scraping I mean the bench is awful let's be honest it's absolutely terrible yeah like I say I I would this is just me personally I would turn Dan Dan burn into Lewis dunk sure that's what I would do i' I'd happily have double Brighton defense especially over these these next couple of fixtures that face will become gaves so we save 0.1 in the bank that all 0.1 and it means then that we would have some because switches fixtures do turn well they they've turning pretty much now they got Brighton Southampton away Ashton at home not great but then West Ham away horrible but then Everton at home brenford away Lester at home so they got a few good fixtures there's a small possibility that we could be rotating with dunk yes in fact there we are you see when when when Brighton are away at Newcastle I could have Greaves at home to Everton and then when Brighton are away at Liverpool I could have Greaves at home to Leicester for instance and then you got woles at home for Brighton Wells which are away at brenford so there's a a bit of a an okay um pairing there between them two but certainly I don't want to go anywhere near um Newcastle whatsoever and then finally the the one that we're both kind of in agreeance which is actually really really nice is the 343 the more balanced Squad uh the buan conza Trent Robinson Salah matoma Seena Rogers Jackson howand HTS and then on the bench fabianski who can be turned into fleen please could you bring it on screen it is on screen F uh Greaves that'll be and then porro will be that particular player as well so this is the team here which I think is a lot more well balanced but again this is more for moving forward into the season rather than my plan of having the it be what would it what would it be by game week seven it' be two free transfers Ray or three for me be two it be two yeah when you wild card does it roll a transfer now I don't know because it does yeah but I've got none anyway so it doesn't really matter so be two free transfers in game week seven where like I say those particular individuals of Watkins will turn straight back into hland that that'll be done that that's that's really easy and then I'll have so if I do it on my screen here once it all actually loads up so if I put in place the players which I had for my 343 with Palmer and Watkins in so yeah I would have let's just say gets to game week seven right then let's bring back hland he'll probably be 15.3 which is just when you think about it it's just crazy but it'll be 15.3 but either way there is there hand is there and then I'll have to either get rid of Salah or Palmer and I'd have 6.1 in the bank but there could be easy ways to downgrade um another player maybe even in Liverpool getting rid of Robertson and then I've got at that point 12.1 in the bank and yeah we we can we can certainly by that point play around with it it may even be that Salah could be the one that could go still keep yeah still keep pal we haven't we haven't played around with no Salah either of us so maybe that's kind of like the next conversation we haven't you are right but getting rid of Salah in game week seven where he's fixtures even though again he is fixture proof getting rid of Salah it is a case of okay it's it's Crystal Palace away Chelsea at home Arsenal away Brighton at home nothing to be scared of there whereas Arsenal ironically they'll have Southampton Bournemouth then Liverpool and Newcastle and I'd probably and I'd be probably probably bringing in oh but then again like you said then Arsenal have got Chelsea and it's not for as at home they've got they've got three really horrible fixtures in those between game weeks 9 and 11 so it's certainly something to to to think about Ray as we approach gameweek seven we will have a lot more supposed data by this point hopefully howand will um will do absolutely nothing I mean Philip saying without howand you get Salah Palmer Saka as a two premium Defenders and two decent Striker and this is this is what we're we've been discussing here is that that's what my team is up on screen yeah it's this is what my team is here where you've got Watkins for his next three fixures that's why I'm almost because Ray do you want to tell the audience something that you that I've asked you to do but you said you won't do so I asked you to do what regarding a team yeah funny it was kind of my idea almost in a voice note and then I kind of retracted so I was actually thinking of not necessarily making a team via the app but using my Wild Card getting on an Excel and basically facing steo and steo kind of then said why don't you just make a team and you know put him in the game week four trophy put him in the game week four trophy league and go forward and I came back and I said look I'm kind of going against my principles of what I said is that I won't play the game anymore I love this I I love uh not advising but you know being being a sparring partner for you on this and giving my ideas because it is still enjoyable in regards to planning for someone else I thinking I think of it almost as what I doing my job and if I if I can share is that you know you you didn't it wasn't patronizing to me but you said you know you're proud of me that I've stuck by my guns and and and gone with my word and I and take that as a huge compliment because I know what will happen I I play to win you know and I think that's very clear is when I play something I don't do it half ass and if I suddenly went forward and said okay it's my Wild Card versus your wild card what's going to happen we're going to go through the old season I'm playing the game bloody again and you know it's it's it's something I don't want to do because I'm enjoying not being part of the game anymore and also you know I've I've put myself out there you know we've done the streams together it's on my YouTube channel I say I don't play the game anymore I don't I don't want to be a liar so yeah no no I and I completely respect that and we got a Philipe saying here why don't you downgrade um essentially Watkins for salanki and then upgrade seeno well then you're essentially relying on Rogers who isn't proven yeah he's clearly a very very good player but the reality is he's done nothing whereas Watkins all right then he's done done nothing officially but we know that he's a top top class Striker it's my favorite team I've seen on the stream which is on screen at the moment that's with the Watkins one um Ray and and this is my point I'm more happy using this as my three game week wild card and this is why I love talking with Ray and having in having him as the consultant and yeah I'm gutted that he doesn't want to supposedly challenge me shall we say if we're going to use that terminology for the gameweek four trophy league but the reality is that Ray doesn't want to want to compete against me but I think I think personally Ray over the next three game weeks this will outscore a hen team I mean you are going to be keeping I mean what will happen is is that you're going to whichever team you end up thinking is the best one in your opinion so for let's just say for just for argument sake we both agree that for balance this 343 with Nicholas Jackson in is probably the the better one of of all the drafts you sent me this is probably in your opinion the most well balanced with harand and Salah absolutely yeah now the question for chat is does let's just say we've got the veran and fleen double up does the likes of a conza and Robinson beat beat Robertson and Lewis forget the rotation stuff we're not looking into rotation we're just going to assume that Rico Lewis is nailed because I've also got the the options on the bench with with uh with Lewis where I can get rid of not necessarily get rid of him per se but I've got Robinson that can come in for Lewis if and when necessary and Greaves potentially coming in for for Lewis if and when necessary but we then have Salah versus Salah matoma versus Palmer and then we then have ummo up against one of well it's not even up against it's it is pretty much and bermo versus Rogers because I'm probably going to be benching Rogers more ahead of and Burma because I've seen say I've seen enough of Bournemouth but Bournemouth for me are attacking enough where that Southampton game at home and Leicester away I know that's not three game weeks but certainly even though you've got them in your team could be really really good and with Chelsea being at home to being at home to Brighton and Nottingham Forest as well we've got Palmer ahead of matoma who's got Chelsea and then Tottenham which again could be still profitable and then you got Jackson against Pedro hen and havs as they are because me and you both agree that to be fair we''re pretty much there or thereabouts with being happy with either team because the majority of the players that me and you have chosen are virtually the same yeah I think I I think we said it in the last stream well in the patreon episode and also when we vo know as well is that it's about 101 players there isn't it it's it's it's now the big shout regarding it's almost a harand versus palmer but again it's combinations isn't it that with that money you save you're able to bring in Robertson for example so you have double Liverpool defense and you know Robertson as well is going to be taking up a lot of areas where I expect him to get a couple of returns so attacking returns there was a comment that was really it definitely hit home is that you know some men Rogers matoma and Adama tror is kind of you're relying he's right is that you're relying on these guys to actually be able to do something to compensate having Harland which is very very true but I do feel like that there are going to be players who do like last season you know you get cheapes who hit out and and start performing well and I I fully agree with your seeno shout that he's got two goals and an assist in his three games and without salanki now I thought it was going to be cber that steps up I I I I vividly remember saying that in the preseason streams that we did but seeno could be that guy and you don't really want to miss out and I actually really like the fixtures apart from Liverpool away I think Chelsea at home's a great fixture attacker so and but but again there's arguments both ways but I think one thing we agree with is that Salah has to be in these drafts because you know in game week screw it even in game week four 456 he might be the best Captain to go for every single game week and again I I keep reiterating this point my wild card is a ceny for the next three game weeks and then it's straight back onto hland for Fulham and then wolves Southampton Bournemouth who would you take out actually what what are the changes you'd make I didn't so would be wat Watkins would be going out for hland and then it would be a tossup between Palmer and Salah if I get rid of Salah it means then I can upgrade anywhere up to 10 million or something like that right that's the thing I will have a lot of money in the bank if I get rid of Salah still have Palmer still have Palmer in my team you could you could put him to Diaz isn't it really so you still have a Liverpool attacker but you won't Captain him obviously yeah and we just or even J or and you've H you yeah but this is exactly the point this is why it's going to be so crucial over the next few game weeks where we see where the where the the lay of the land is so to speak the lay of the land could be completely different by gameweek seven where howand continues scoring for fun but I will maintain that their game against brenford what you seriously think brenford are going to be defensively weak against M no that their games against brenford we we need to be getting out of here Ray um just just to give you simple example so brenford when they play Man City I'm telling you this when I looked at it the other day I was like oh it's not actually that high scoring so please load up the highest scoring game was last season when they beat brenford away 3-1 other than that we've got one nil two nil you the voice 2-1 brenford win one one one nil brenford win then the 3-1 then one nil brenford are no mugs they're not going to do a Southampton I which were Le were a Burnley they're going to I think they're going to do very very well at containing Man City and we then move on to Man City when it comes to versus Arsenal well Ray you can already tell us immediately what were last two season results yeah nil nil and one nil nil nil one I don't think harand had a shot in either game again do we really think Arsenal just going to roll over and have their bellies tickled no this is the last several results between Arsenal and Man City including Cup games so yeah there's a two anomalies here where in the 15th of February 2023 and the 26th of April 2023 Man City won by a aggregate score of 72 in between all that we've got Man City one Arsenal nil Arsenal One Man City one Arsenal One Man City nil Man City nil Arsenal nil and yet oh we got a captain hen now you're Bonkers if you seriously think like this and then Newcastle once again the the fixtures aren't almost specifically the history isn't that bad it's very it's it's not the same as Arsenal but from what I remember looking at the history yeah well we've got a 33 then we got a 2 nil 1 nil 1 nil and then we got a high scoring 32 and then a 2 N and funny enough in the 32 in the game in the Premier League at at Newcastle this was at Newcastle guess what Howen did in that game in three goals what did hen do he did nothing he did absolute in fact to be honest with you he didn't even play he didn't actually play that game would you believe you couldn't make it up could you he didn't actually play in that game but in the one-nil victory where Newcastle beat them um I think he no in the two-nil sorry in the 2-0 in the FA Cup I don't think Howen played in that game or did he I'm trying to think I think he did but he did nothing and the answer is he did play and he did nothing I me it's the FA Cup game and and man City's team was full strength full strength versus Newcastle so again I'm not expecting it to be easy fixtures and yeah Ray I I'm really really tempted and I probably will do it going to go with this it's just such a shame that you're not I know you won't and I respect it it's just such a shame that you're not um willing to create that FPL team just to put into the troph trophy League to go against me that would be really really fun Ray I've got to get out of here I've got I've got to get to work um so on that note everybody I just want to say thanks everybody for tuning in live if you are watching on the replay why not comment below on your favored Wild Card drafts that myself and Ray have come up with other than that if you are brand new around here make sure you're subscribing and making sure that you are hitting the like button if you've enjoyed the stream or not Ray thank you for joining me any final thoughts before we go not at all no thank you as always steo and thanks everyone in the chat and please leave your comments about the wild draft uh the wild draft they are wild drafts but the wild cards and perhaps pop yours in the comments as well and see and I can have a look at it that was fun Ray thank you sir see you lat everybody,9695,a impromptu live stream discussing all things wild card theres a specific reason why myself and rare doing this because anybody that is a patreon member will be aware of an hour and a half discussion me and ry had talking about m wild card and i said to ry afterwards im like why arent we doing this on a live stream we should have done this as a live stream because i think it would be more beneficial to the channel from a from a self point of view so good morning ry good morning steo how are you im im im all good ive got an hour before work so we got a quick say rush through it were g to have an hour of discussion about all this because me and you have been chatting since that patreon podcast regarding the factors of having salah having no salah having hen having no hen or having both essentially is this now in my specific team which you saw the other day within reason we were both in agreement that were happy with the picks that ive gone with this just the odd one here or there you werent particularly happy with the wild card that i want to do ill be showing people in a minute but im going to put up on screen now my team which is their the wild card team right now and weve got the braning go lewis dea trent rogers diaz salah seeno htz pedro and holland and then on the sub bench we have got fleen because its going to be that rotation pairing of fleen and foran and robinson and greaves of ipswitch so my concerns with this specific team i say concerns players that im not particularly interested in specific al for the next three game weeks and i must make this clear this is for the ne this is this wild card is essentially before i get hen back is for the next three game weeks so game weeks four five and six i dont want this team i want the majority of it im not going to lie the majority of this team is going to be staying as it is the team that i want for myself personally is going to be the one that im putting up on screen now ray which is going to be no hland whatsoever its going to have zero hland but what it will have is palmer watkins and robertson instead so im going to put that up on screen now there we are all is glory i wonder if thats going to become even better for the audience yep there it is so essentially instead of hland someone else who ive completely forgotten about diaz and dena ive got robertson palmer and watkins for the next three game weeks those specific fixtures for anybody listening on audio in fact ry you could probably tell me because i havent even got the fbl site up on my screen would you believe but certainly i do know that the fixtures for aston villa are very good i know that the going against palmer is something which i think im going to potentially regret because i think palmer is fixture proof and double liverpool defense i think for these fixtures that theyve got up coming knock forest bournemouth walls crystal palace in my opinion are just i think theyre theyre gold dust and with man citys fixtures of brenford arsenal newcastle for these next three i dont i per i personally think from a team stand point ill do better with this team with watkins palmer and robertson over what youre going to be suggesting which is hen in this team and then it that comes at a detriment to x y and zed players so do you want to just talk us through your thought processes regarding having firstly having hen in the team i think a lot covers the week against the game against brenford where hell be the most captain player and i fully expect him to at least get one return so i can see your thinking in regards to not having him but i just feel like harlands e eo will be so unreal probably 160 170 that any return that he does get its probably going to plummet you quite a bit and at the moment the ranks are pretty close and i dont feel like its worth not having him at all for your shortterm gain because what could happen not necessarily with you is that i think a lot of people hit the ward button because they didnt have holland so youre taking him out now to put him back in meaning that youre coining in transfers and if you have an injury here or there might be a little bit of a delay to bring in or you might have to take some hits so personally i think you could still and im sure well go through it because i sent you a couple of drafts i think having harland in you can still create an excellent squad going forward where you have him and salah but i know youre specifically thinking harand so to be honest with you steo i think i said to you is that even though hes not the best captain for the next three game weeks if you if you just build it all as three game games but i still expect him to get a minimum of two goals and if he gets a minimum of two goals then people are going to captain him against brenford and i wouldnt be surprised if they captain him against newcastle even though i did say to you the other day i think newcastle are more defensive again is im unsure its worth the risk and thats the word i think its risky to not have him so thats my assessment what are your thoughts thing is i look at the overall picture to be honest with you regarding the probability of returns from haland diaz the likes of dea versus the very high potential of watkins palmer and robertson so with liverpool for instance i the way they are playing at the moment they dont look like theyre going to concede a goal forever not what but it probably be ironic now that theyre going to concede to a team in nottingham forest who never can never create a goal scoring opportunity whatsoever but the two liverpool fixtures upcoming at home with not forest and bourma bearing in mind these are coming in after international fixtures and reading a couple of x accounts which i respect a lot in andy mine and this guy called fpl olympian they make some excellent points regarding going no hen certainly for the next three game weeks mainly because of the opposition but there are other circumstances surrounding some of the international players which are a bit concerning that regarding whether they start or not so diaz is a prime example of somebody who with the champions league upcoming in as well theres a possibility that he may not start the game against notting forest we know hens going to be starting every single game i know hes not a rotation risk whatsoever but the upside to not owning haland in these three fixtures is that with the likes of olle watkins who as i can see i know theres people in the chat saying here about this watkins are wait and see but i find that but i find that the three fixtures for watkins outweighs hland so everton rules ip switch aston villa have a very good chance of winning these next three quite comfortably you then have chelsea with b withth west ham admittedly both away and then brighton at home chelsea is scoring goals for fun a fact tricker lips was making a point about the fact that chelsea are one of the highest since the turn of the year theyre theyre one of the highest scoring teams in the in the premier league and then youve got with like i said with liverpool the way theyre defending at the moment and performing well theyve got three fixtures of which are against three teams which dont score that many goals and i think that they should they should be keeping two clean sheets in the next three in my opinion whereas like i said with diaz potentially being a rotation risk over the next three or four fixtures with the competition from the likes of gapo as an example just as a simple example and theres other players as well that can be coming in with man city regarding captaincy you are right like howand is going to the most cap captain player against brenford im not going to sit and pretend hes not full liverpools history against nottingham forest at home is just incredible man citys history against brenford to be completely frank is their history against arsenal over the last few fixtures has been terrible newcastle its not been that great in fact i did a tiny bit of research and just going on the last two fixures and i dont mean premier league i just mean all fixures in general hens record against brenford arsenal newcastle isnt that great not that great against brenford not too bad but against arsenal and newcastle in the last two fixes again not necessarily premier league but he started them both he hasnt scored hes not done well at all and even though your argument for the fact that hens ownership and effective ownership and all that is going to be skyrocketing you are completely right this is over the next three game weeks ray sure ill have salah as captain versus notting forest against bournemouth and then theres a question mark regarding who to captain game week six when it comes to whether it could be away at walls it could be potentially watkins away at ipswitch it could even be palmer in a highscoring game against brighton and when gw seven comes around its simple ray i get rid of howand see you later mate hes gone and then theres a no sorry i bring back i bring back howand in gw seven easy i can i can do it i can do it with no price worries whatsoever i can then potentially then get rid of palmer and then i can bring in a another possible ability of a premium asset in for argument sake even it could even be liverpool it could even be salah in bringing in sack by attacking the arsenal fixtures from game week seven where its sav hampton at home bournemouth away and then onto a couple of difficult fixtures in liverpool at home and then newcastle away but to be honest with you again i think arsenal like man city like liverpool ironically are all three of them are fixture proof so just lets just see a couple of comments here andrew griffith saying diaz and jot wont play bournemouth i went i want to wild card dom junes saying but i dont think we have enough information how things will be in the next couple of couple of weeks well thats why you hit the wild card you just bring in a team of players that you want and then whatever information comes out comes out but to be honest with you i cant see anything changing in the next its not even two weeks its what ray weve got less than a weve got just over a week its thursday today and then weve got the internationals on saturday and tuesday and wednesday and then its just back to reality so i dont have a problem with the information we got the information weve got at the moment are the fact that arsenal are doing well at the moment aston villa are just plugging along with what they do the only downside to ason ville is that watkins isnt particularly performing at the moment like of chelsea theyre just sporadic at the moment but theyre scoring goals for fun fulham i think have disappointed me personally you then have the teams that were promoted are all doing what we expected which is liverpool and man city are just plooding along as expected in fact id argue that man city specifically hland is doing a hell of a lot better than anybody even expected and i would argue thats the same with salah as well man united well theyre an absolute sack of spurs i think spurs the team that people need to be like wanting to be reassessing and i think for me the team that ive got here with watkins palmer and robertson has got a better balance in my opinion than with the team where ive got on screen now with holland and diaz ive got the two premium defenders and even then robertson could turn into a gabrielle celba you then have which is similar pricing anyway diaz becomes a player in which is a guaranteed starter for chelsea no matter what and in a chelsea team that scores goals and then watkins hes got the fixtures ray hes hes got the fixtures so i think from nonh harland perspective i think its a good squad and i think and again with the drafts ive sent you one with a three meum and one with a tum however you want to say it is you want you want options on the squad you dont want everything on the 11 especially on a walk card and i think what youve done is youve built a wellrounded squad to take you through the next three game weeks so theres a theres an argument on the side of not going harland from what youre saying absolutely and it does make sense so im not going to just stand on my side and say no you got to have harand i believe you must have harland but if youre not going to have it i can understand your perspective however harand scored seven goals in three matches its absolutely unbelievable and you want to put it past him getting another hattick against brenford i know what youre saying about the history absolutely but he looks different like he does look fresh he looks at it and hes just getting better hes only 22 23 years old hes its unbelievable what hollands doing its just unbelievable so i just am concerned for you that if and when he does get that hall over the next three weeks hey it could be against arsenal who knows the way hes playing and the way man city are playing i dont believe so but against newcastle it could potentially happen is that i am concerned that youre youre youre youre facing against a mountain and youre hoping your other players that you havent captained okay youre going to captain salah but the other players you havent captained need to somehow cover those haring points and im unsure how worth it is but go ahead so you dont thinking logically b bas on the fact that what weve seen from the premium assets including sacka so sacka palmer salah in fact look at it here the theres so many of them well this is the point this is why its so ridiculous is that work so the top scoring players so far this season in fpl salah premium palmer premium sacka premi premium so three of the top four are premium based players within the game itself you then have diaz who plays for a premium team in liverpool you then have sun who plays for a premium team mea wacky whatever you may think plays for chelsea at the end of the day the only the only anomaly here is in burma however the information that weve had over the few years that weve seen brenford without tony is that ambero steps up and does well of the fixes that umos had are we surprised that hes there in the top five no not particularly and i think that certainly moving forward with like i said with these fixtures because what i was going to say is do you seriously think that for argument sake with my in fact lets just bring up one of your teams that you sent me perfect so well go with the thrum as youve called it so well go with the thrum so the freemium you sent me was as follows you had salah palmer and haland so it was veran and go conza trent dan well we can im telling you now im not having dan bur im not having newcastle in my team so he can clear off salah palmer seeno rogers brilliant in fact this im not going to sit and pretend its not this team is beautiful its pretty much exactly the same team as what ive got the only differences is its just the bench and then you got pedro howand and havs when i saw this team this morning barring dan burn which made me sick in my mouth i like it because we then got robinson robinson fas can be gaves im not having any lester in my team winks he can continue as he is and then fabianski who looks like he could be the only downside to this team of course is that were only talking and theres nothing wrong with this one goalkeeper and that goalkeeper being i think i probably would go down the route with having the brighton asset because of the simple fact that they have got the better fixtures over the next two for definite but fleen seems to be a save points magnet we dont know now the brans been told that hes first choice we dont know how hes going to perform but whatever at the end of the day hes playing for brighton hes going to do well no matter what the same as brenford i put brighton brenford in the same category teams to be honest with you i dont mean in the way they play i just mean theyre going to be there or there about in the same positions in the league bright brightons opening next few fixtures zip switch nothing for us chelsea tottenham newcastle wolves liverpool theyre not that particularly great whereas with brenford theyve got man city tottenham west ham wolves man united i switch fulham i i personally argue fleen has got the better opponents hence why i like the brighton brenford rotation i think thats not quite necessity for me but i do like the fact that i would have the option to have ive got veran at home to ipwi ive then got veran at home to the next opponents have completely forgotten a not in forest and then i can then jump on to brenford where theyve got west ham wolves man united and then after the man united game i can then go on to the bran with wolves but were were splitting head with that but that team there ra you want to just talk us through your reasonings behind i get the whole palmer and all the premiums but dan burn was it just you putting a 45 defender in there for the sake of it he could easily be dunk and theug be flecken isnt it theres its its price point its more of a price point team maybe burn is there like you said for the sake of it but i think the so on paper i absolutely adore the 11 in total i think i did a solid job fitting all the viable and attractive assets into the team the problem is that bench is crap because youre going to have winks that youre never going to play fast or that four the four million defender youre going to be relying them at some point and theyre going to be a lot of instances where its probably going to be a 442 formation simply because of the fixtures with your other players like for example havs away at man city i dont like the game and even se meno away to liverpool okay he could do something because i dont think liverpool are as defensively solid as you do but youre going to be relying too much on these budget enabling players every single week to compensate having haren palmer salah and trent so are you referring to this team the one ive ive been the thum team the other team i definitely want us to go through as well is that this was more of you were telling me that palmers a player you do worry not having and im like okay well let me play around and see if i can fit something in but youre relying on a player like rogers whos unproven seno we still got to wait a bit longer how much will be that talisman at the sank is there not there anymore every week like havit is not a consistently proven fpl asset xiao pedro what next week will look like but surely as an arsenal fan you must agree that hes been performing very well for you and hes clear the per brilliantly but against spurs i expect him to play in midfield who would be the front three then i think it will be sterling sacka and trossard i think you mad r im sorry i cannot see artetta dropping havs back in midfield i know then again you got no dean rice have you we dont have rice and marino and i dont think hell play party and georgino willll get outrun havit is in there to be an engine honestly sterling i think theres more chance of martinelli being played through the middle alongside trad and sacka than sterling being thrown in okay personally i dont know anything but no you do no you make no you make a you make a compelling point but okay but i think havs will play in midfield thats my prediction however id still have him in the team like hed be the arsenal asset i go for so because youre quite right hes been fantastic as i expected him to be so but again is a lot of these players are like xiao pedro for brighton again i think we ive said this a lot of times apart from matoma and burn not burn matoma and dunk i think theyre the only two nailed players in the whole team at the moment steo enjoy jia pedra as we as much as we can but i wouldnt be surprised if hes randomly benched if hes benched against ipswitch or forest with this squad the draft ive given youre relying on a harry winks or your ips switch defender lets just say john well someone else this is why i love my team regarding the nonhand now admitt were talking about a team with howand but the nonhand draft im not relying on these players right im relying on for instance if and when and bermo coming off the bench if pedro doesnt play a minute against dip switch if i feel that pedro was called up to brazil at some point yesterday and hes back quite late so we going to get news no matter what if pedro is going to be starting and the brighton manager has come out and said words to the effect of pedros amazing for my team and the way we play pedro is the main man and that breeds confidence but like youve just said he comes back late for brazil if for argument sake he doesnt feel like hes up to it i can easily play in bermo in this in this thre but i call it a forum because youve got trent alexander arnold in there im then going do i play rob id probably play robinson lets just say pedro was ruled out hed be like id play robinson ahead of pedro for instance and like you say with this specific team its its too heavily relyant on your cheapy players plus in midfield like you quite righty say even though in my watkins team ive still got seanu and roders i could easily if i want to play on burma ahead of rogers but this is the game where you will thinking no steo you want to be at least playing rogers in that one fixture at home to everton at least give him that opportunity but your next team that you brought up which is only the freemium at this point hland salah and trent its a lot more balanced by far by far its a lot more balanced by far and it is as follows were going withing goal again coner trent robinson theres a theme here salah matoma seena rogers nicholas jackson haland hts and then fabianski adams i who is adams its adam full d try right okay th and poro and five in the bank just thought i put said that and five in the bank as well now i personally hate leaving premium team defenders on the bench id be playing poro no matter what okay i dont care id be playing him over robinson im telling you that for free so i hate benching premium team defenders but this team here i was going to say j then this team here ray is like you say a lot more well balanced like you said youve got 0 five in the bank which for me id upgrade fabianski to fleen thats what i would do i just want to use all my money and it means at this point your team is now absolutely perfect in fact so if thats 05 because tra race five million is that right i think his incredible value at five million so five million there we then in this in this team here i would upgrade fe to not even upgrade id just drop him down to grieve so that gives us 06 ray in the bank think about that weve got the aston villa coverage in kza defense and rogers in attack trent who i love robinson brilliant player for fulham very attacking but he beber plays with poro it doesnt matter we still got we still got robinson in the team salah matoma is the possible one where he may not even be able to start again against dip swit because of the fact hes on international duty playing with japan small possibility that the manager make come out and say sorry hes not ready for this game possibility youve then got the coverage in chelsea with nicholas jackson whos got zero well hes got competition but he looks like hes going to be the main stay up top for now he has hes done nothing wrong so hes the main stay this team here i must admit ray i like do you want to go through your thoughts with this particular team and why you went with it so i created multiple drafts for yourself but other people as well i was i was saying to you that i still get dms which is great so im still involved in a consultancy role havent you the word today and i just like this because every week theres a balance every week there are options maybe the only weak one is gaves but everyone else could play every single week and youre quite right if matoma comes back from japan a day before and youre bit like i dont know if i want to play him okay ill put in adam a tror hts away to man city bad game on paper you might think what ill bench him ill play adam atreo ill play pedro ill play robinson ill go 442 i think theres so much movement that you have in this team and i think another key point which i didnt mention before is you got the price points in pretty much every position isnt it you got the most expensive midfielder you got the most expensive striker and i look at a jackson and i think jackson is not a season keeper jackson is a okay i hope he plays these next three or four games and assess it from there i look at him hes got bournemouth west ham brighton and forest in his next four games i would be very surprised if he doesnt start at least three of those because like i said in the last stream hes the only actual target man in essence in air quotes i use that very loosely that term that chelsea have and a lot of the times in the in the three games that they played is that jackson does find himself hes got fantastic movement for frontman like hes in great positions hes just not a great finisher however i still expect him to get a couple of goals over the next two three games and i also thought to myself why i think this draft is so much better than the other one i sent you is because its a lot of money to have palmer and youre not going to cap him and im just thinking look get an asset who at the moment is playing whos in form who seems to be trusted even from last season as well nico jackson started most of the games is that i just feel like thats probably the question mark in this team the reason i went with matoma and not pedro is because i didnt know which chelsea i said to bring in i think what your current team lacks is you dont have a chelsea player and i feel that you need to have an attacker and the only other player i can think of apart from palmer is jackson steven now he could be look i wont be surp look mesas got 48 players i wouldnt be surprised that nico jackson has a crap game against bournemouth a game i dont think theyll win by the way he could have a crap game against bournemouth and its like what against west ham ill play xiao felix it can absolutely happen but with the way hes playing and his xg is i just think its its its its a worthwhile punt so those are my thoughts in regards to the rest of the team quite right you can make i ani into fleen as you rightly said robinson could be dunk if you want triple brenford brighton excuse me but i think the rest of it is pretty well balanced i like the porro shout because i think i said to you the other day but very briefly is even though spurs were just a pile of crap against newcastle pedro good have got assists they hit the bar his average position is ridiculous he plays as a winger steo and if you want tottenham coverage which i advocate having spurs coverage is against arsenal theyll create opportunities the way they play against brenford against man united then they got brighton west ham these are good fixtures for porro in my opinion from an offensive point of view that hey why not tap into it if you got the budget so d saying do you have full faith in palmer doing well steo because that premium has taken a ton of your budget that could be spent improving players like seenu and getting e i have a lot of faith in palmer what does he need to prove what did he do last season he scored god knows how many goals got how many assists and now hes surrounded by even better players is pretty much going to be the key component to chelsea this year definitely i think that hes for me i just want him and thats just him as a man so i like palmer i think hes absolutely brilliant but rays case regarding nico jackson just to that chelsea coverage and the fact that you wont be that i wont be captain in palmer even though i expect palmer to outs school jackson thats how i see it ray just players are going to be outscoring one another rather than worrying about the captaincy but like you say in negates away from other players in your team that are better than say the likes of seeno alexander mcbrien saying trent is a nogo for me look at his performance so far youre only playing 7m for clean sheet for a premium defender way expecting to get attack and returns again based on history trent alexander arnold is an individual who will over the next few game weeks score a double digit hall its there its coming and i youve g him in your telegraph game havent you ray whos that sorry trent alexander on absolutely i think i think personally alexander that a is imminent because he is picking up great positions he got his goal the other day right philly offside but it was gutting and i just feel with those fixtures against forest and bournemouth i me theyre just going to be camped in the half and trents average position is going to be insane and i think its imminent hell get a return in the next two games i look i look at trent and think you need to have him in your wild draft i think you need to have him in your team and quite rightfully so telegraph steo i am looking to bring in salah but it wont be at the sacrifice of trent i think trent over the next five matches forest bournemouth wolves palace chelsea i can see two three attacking returns honestly dom saying is well hes making a statement ry essential on a wild card your goalkeeper ray your goalkeeper for arsenal what do you think on ry i think no those fixtures are tough id rather go for defender and then bench him for the next two i know you dont like that b rathera go for a premium defender b rathera go for a cba benim and then in game week six you got a real nice run of three fixtures now about arsenal quickly is you cant ignore that despite the fact that from game week six to eight we got nice fixtures we then got liverpool newcastle chelsea away so i dont think theres a priority to bring in arsenal defensive assets but i never considered an arsenal defender in any of the drafts that i made for steo like never i just thought havit is enough theres a lot of people watching right now make sure you are hitting the like button and of course if you are brand new around here and youre enjoying the content myself jason and ray bring you please make sure you are subscribing to the channel so involving the chat here lets get a poll not even a poll a live a live one here right now chat this team in front of you is the one that im feeling im probably going to end up going with on wild card weve got the rotation around fleen and v rugan it will be robertson at trent along with whoevers got the better fixture out of lewis and robinson a midfield four of palmer salah and bermo and then one of seeno or rogers and then a front three of havs pedro and watkins this is for three game weeks only i should clarify this is for three game weeks only so bearing in mind that hens fixtures arent that great this is for three game weeks only so it be robertson trent lewi for argument sake and burm oa salah seeno htz pedro and watkins what do you think on this three game we team chat what do you think on this three game we team very interested to know what this is what people think about now because i like i like this team ray its got a lot of a lot of balance to it i find that its got the coverage for all the big hitters especially with han man citys tough fixtures i think the newcastle game is going to be difficult for them i expect them to win i think newcastle would have turned it around by them but you are right they are a lot more defensive than what they should be so it be interested to see what the the chat say dale saying i want to stay above youre only above me by a couple of points dale and youve already used triple captaincy as well so its not its not particularly great andrew g andrew griffith saying this is seven out of 10 thats thats thats thats good to hear no one else can to be bothered to rate it ray so well move on to yours see if people can be bothered to rate your one so then we move on to the team which hasnt got much balance at all regarding the subs bench but certainly has got a good team on paper so in goal conza trent dan burn but this is more of a wild card for beyond three game weeks salah palmer seena rogers hedro halan ht and then just not necessarily bench fodder but certainly players in and this is zero in the bank im assuming ray this is this is i dont like this draft i just wanted to show you it can be done but its just you youre looking youre youre barrel scraping the bench is awful lets be honest its absolutely terrible like i say i would this is just me personally i would turn dan burn into lewis dunk sure thats what i would do i id happily have double brighton defense especially over these next couple of fixtures that face will become gaves so we save 01 in the bank that all 01 and it means then that we would have some because switches fixtures do turn well theyve turning pretty much now they got brighton southampton away ashton at home not great but then west ham away horrible but then everton at home brenford away lester at home so they got a few good fixtures theres a small possibility that we could be rotating with dunk yes in fact there we are you see when brighton are away at newcastle i could have greaves at home to everton and then when brighton are away at liverpool i could have greaves at home to leicester for instance and then you got woles at home for brighton wells which are away at brenford so theres a bit of a an okay pairing there between them two but certainly i dont want to go anywhere near newcastle whatsoever and then finally the one that were both in agreeance which is nice is the 343 the more balanced squad the buan conza trent robinson salah matoma seena rogers jackson howand hts and then on the bench fabianski who can be turned into fleen please could you bring it on screen it is on screen f greaves thatll be and then porro will be that particular player as well so this is the team here which i think is a lot more well balanced but again this is more for moving forward into the season rather than my plan of having the it be what would it what would it be by game week seven it be two free transfers ray or three for me be two it be two when you wild card does it roll a transfer now i dont know because it does but ive got none anyway so it doesnt matter so be two free transfers in game week seven where like i say those particular individuals of watkins will turn straight back into hland thatll be done thats thats easy and then ill have so if i do it on my screen here once it all loads up so if i put in place the players which i had for my 343 with palmer and watkins in so i would have lets just say gets to game week seven right then lets bring back hland hell probably be 153 which is just when you think about its just crazy but itll be 153 but either way there is there hand is there and then ill have to either get rid of salah or palmer and id have 61 in the bank but there could be easy ways to downgrade another player maybe even in liverpool getting rid of robertson and then ive got at that point 121 in the bank and we can we can certainly by that point play around with it may even be that salah could be the one that could go still keep still keep pal we havent we havent played around with no salah either of us so maybe thats like the next conversation we havent you are right but getting rid of salah in game week seven where hes fixtures even though again he is fixture proof getting rid of salah it is a case of okay its its crystal palace away chelsea at home arsenal away brighton at home nothing to be scared of there whereas arsenal ironically theyll have southampton bournemouth then liverpool and newcastle and id probably and id be probably bringing in but then again like you said then arsenal have got chelsea and its not for as at home theyve got theyve got three horrible fixtures in those between game weeks 9 and 11 so its certainly something to think about ray as we approach gw seven we will have a lot more supposed data by this point hopefully howand will will do absolutely nothing philip saying without howand you get salah palmer saka as a two premium defenders and two decent striker and this is this is what were weve been discussing here is thats what my team is up on screen its this is what my team is here where youve got watkins for his next three fixures thats why im almost because ray do you want to tell the audience something that you that ive asked you to do but you said you wont do so i asked you to do what regarding a team funny it was my idea almost in a voice note and then i retracted so i was thinking of not necessarily making a team via the app but using my wild card getting on an excel and facing steo and steo then said why dont you just make a team and put him in the game week four trophy put him in the game week four trophy league and go forward and i came back and i said look im going against my principles of what i said is that i wont play the game anymore i love this i love not advising being a sparring partner for you on this and giving my ideas because it is still enjoyable in regards to planning for someone else i thinking i think of it almost as what i doing my job and if i if i can share is that you didnt it wasnt patronizing to me but you said youre proud of me that ive stuck by my guns and gone with my word and i and take that as a huge compliment because i know what will happen i play to win and i think thats very clear is when i play something i dont do it half ass and if i suddenly went forward and said okay its my wild card versus your wild card whats going to happen were going to go through the old season im playing the game bloody again and its its its something i dont want to do because im enjoying not being part of the game anymore and also ive ive put myself out there weve done the streams together its on my youtube channel i say i dont play the game anymore i dont i dont want to be a liar so no i and i completely respect that and we got a philipe saying here why dont you downgrade essentially watkins for salanki and then upgrade seeno well then youre essentially relying on rogers who isnt proven hes clearly a very good player but the reality is hes done nothing whereas watkins all right then hes done nothing officially but we know that hes a top class striker its my favorite team ive seen on the stream which is on screen at the moment thats with the watkins one ray and this is my point im more happy using this as my three game week wild card and this is why i love talking with ray and having in having him as the consultant and im gutted that he doesnt want to supposedly challenge me shall we say if were going to use that terminology for the gw four trophy league but the reality is that ray doesnt want to want to compete against me but i think i think personally ray over the next three game weeks this will outscore a hen team you are going to be keeping what will happen is that youre going to whichever team you end up thinking is the best one in your opinion so for lets just say for just for argument sake we both agree that for balance this 343 with nicholas jackson in is probably the better one of all the drafts you sent me this is probably in your opinion the most well balanced with harand and salah absolutely now the question for chat is does lets just say weve got the veran and fleen double up does the likes of a conza and robinson beat robertson and lewis forget the rotation stuff were not looking into rotation were just going to assume that rico lewis is nailed because ive also got the options on the bench with with lewis where i can get rid of not necessarily get rid of him per se but ive got robinson that can come in for lewis if and when necessary and greaves potentially coming in for lewis if and when necessary but we then have salah versus salah matoma versus palmer and then we then have ummo up against one of well its not even up against its it is pretty much and bermo versus rogers because im probably going to be benching rogers more ahead of and burma because ive seen say ive seen enough of bournemouth but bournemouth for me are attacking enough where that southampton game at home and leicester away i know thats not three game weeks but certainly even though youve got them in your team could be good and with chelsea being at home to being at home to brighton and nottingham forest as well weve got palmer ahead of matoma whos got chelsea and then tottenham which again could be still profitable and then you got jackson against pedro hen and havs as they are because me and you both agree that to be fair were pretty much there or thereabouts with being happy with either team because the majority of the players that me and you have chosen are virtually the same i think i think we said it in the last stream well in the patreon episode and also when we vo know as well is that its about 101 players there isnt its its its now the big shout regarding its almost a harand versus palmer but again its combinations isnt it that with that money you save youre able to bring in robertson for example so you have double liverpool defense and robertson as well is going to be taking up a lot of areas where i expect him to get a couple of returns so attacking returns there was a comment that was it definitely hit home is that some men rogers matoma and adama tror is youre relying hes right is that youre relying on these guys to be able to do something to compensate having harland which is very true but i do feel like that there are going to be players who do like last season you get cheapes who hit out and start performing well and i fully agree with your seeno shout that hes got two goals and an assist in his three games and without salanki now i thought it was going to be cber that steps up i vividly remember saying that in the preseason streams that we did but seeno could be that guy and you dont want to miss out and i like the fixtures apart from liverpool away i think chelsea at homes a great fixture attacker so and but again theres arguments both ways but i think one thing we agree with is that salah has to be in these drafts because in game week screw it even in game week four 456 he might be the best captain to go for every single game week and again i keep reiterating this point my wild card is a ceny for the next three game weeks and then its straight back onto hland for fulham and then wolves southampton bournemouth who would you take out what are the changes youd make i didnt so would be wat watkins would be going out for hland and then it would be a tossup between palmer and salah if i get rid of salah it means then i can upgrade anywhere up to 10m like that right thats the thing i will have a lot of money in the bank if i get rid of salah still have palmer still have palmer in my team you could you could put him to diaz isnt it so you still have a liverpool attacker but you wont captain him and we just or even j or and youve h you but this is exactly the point this is why its going to be so crucial over the next few game weeks where we see where the where the lay of the land is so to speak the lay of the land could be completely different by gw seven where howand continues scoring for fun but i will maintain that their game against brenford what you seriously think brenford are going to be defensively weak against m no that their games against brenford we need to be getting out of here ray just to give you simple example so brenford when they play man city im telling you this when i looked at it the other day i was like its not that high scoring so please load up the highest scoring game was last season when they beat brenford away 31 other than that weve got one nil two nil you the voice 21 brenford win one nil brenford win then the 31 then one nil brenford are no mugs theyre not going to do a southampton i which were le were a burnley theyre going to i think theyre going to do very well at containing man city and we then move on to man city when it comes to versus arsenal well ray you can already tell us immediately what were last two season results nil and one nil one i dont think harand had a shot in either game again do we think arsenal just going to roll over and have their bellies tickled no this is the last several results between arsenal and man city including cup games so theres a two anomalies here where in the 15th of february 2023 and the 26th of april 2023 man city won by a aggregate score of 72 in between all that weve got man city one arsenal nil arsenal one man city one arsenal one man city nil man city nil arsenal nil and yet we got a captain hen now youre bonkers if you seriously think like this and then newcastle once again the fixtures arent almost specifically the history isnt that bad its very its its not the same as arsenal but from what i remember looking at the history well weve got a 33 then we got a 2 nil 1 nil 1 nil and then we got a high scoring 32 and then a 2 n and funny enough in the 32 in the game in the premier league at newcastle this was at newcastle guess what howen did in that game in three goals what did hen do he did nothing he did absolute in fact to be honest with you he didnt even play he didnt play that game would you believe you couldnt make it up could you he didnt play in that game but in the onenil victory where newcastle beat them i think he no in the twonil sorry in the 20 in the fa cup i dont think howen played in that game or did he im trying to think i think he did but he did nothing and the answer is he did play and he did nothing i me its the fa cup game and man citys team was full strength full strength versus newcastle so again im not expecting it to be easy fixtures and ray im tempted and i probably will do it going to go with this its just such a shame that youre not i know you wont and i respect its just such a shame that youre not willing to create that fpl team just to put into the troph trophy league to go against me that would be fun ray ive got to get out of here ive got ive got to get to work so on that note everybody i just want to say thanks everybody for tuning in live if you are watching on the replay why not comment below on your favored wild card drafts that myself and ray have come up with other than that if you are brand new around here make sure youre subscribing

4,elitefpl,tZOBHSM-g5Q,FPL GAMEWEEK 4 SUNDAY SURGERY | LET&#39;S RE-EVALUATE | WILDCARD ACTIVE | Fantasy Premier League 2024/25,2024-09-01T20:40:54Z,all right let's go I'm running away from the past I behind looking for answers but I'm blinded by the L in I st night promise I'll be in the morning out of out of my snow out of sight and out of mind snow out of sight and out of mind [Music] just for tonight let your thought be free just for tonight you come with me just for tonight the get just for tonight [Music] so out of sight and out of mind just for tonight come with me blindly you know you keep running but your legs are standing still it's like you're stuck in nightmare but you doing it for the well this is reality you only live it once wake up from your dreams but just for T thees free just for tonight free just for [Music] hello good evening guys good evening so [Music] out of sight and out of snow out of sight and out of mind [Music] um yeah hi I guess look the intro was different because today is for me it's a somber day for football Muhammad Salah coming around and punishing so many fpr man honestly I don't even want to be here right now to be honest I really don't like I said said steo just do a solo mate just do a solo like what have I got why why why would I want to relive the events of today I don't want to I watched that game today and it was just like I've had bad moments as a United fan but oh my God and then and then to to the icing on the cake the icing on the cake in that game they take off arguably our best player in garnacho tenh Hark and they leave rashford on and I haven't seen Mark goldbridge and I'm pretty damn sure Mark goldbridge has talked about it and this isn't about United this this is about FPL but I am absolutely furious at ten hog and I want him gone he needs to go he hasn't got a clue has not got a clue the players are completely clueless as to what they're meant to be doing in the team casamero I just I don't know it's like it's almost like he's it's not just his legs that have gone but his ability to read the game has gone like you know you get these world class players steo they've played all their careers they've reached the top of their game won Champions Leagues their legs start to go but at least at least they've still got their head and they canot anticipate and they can still work things out and they can make up for the fact they're not fast because they can read the game and and maybe intercept and standoff players no no he was his touch was terrible his vision was non-existent what the hell he was trying to do playing the pool out getting getting I mean it was like he was in treal he was like he was stuck in treal and he just couldn't move and the United defense was exposed though time and time again and again this isn't about United but literally the fact is I'm here to talk about football and the first thing I want to talk about is that shower of [ __ ] that was Man United versus Liverpool H and Liverpool fans out there you're watching I know you're watching you can't say you played very well you can't say you were really on top of your game it was handed you on the plate it was absolutely handed you on the plate it was embarrassing you didn't even have to work to score a goal the amount of chances Liverpool had where they created themselves and fudged it up I lost count but every single time United fudged up Liverpool was there to pay basically to pick him off what am I trying to say what I'm trying to say is remove the mistakes in that game from United that game's ending nil nil Salah was very good don't get me wrong the the the ball over the top to the back post was very very good but that came from a mistake came from a mistake all right and ten hog needs to go he needs to go he's not shown he's three games in and I'm already saying he needs to go he's showing absolutely no sign that he's learning from the lessons of last season keeping rashford on keeping staying with casemiro for as long as he did Bruno Fernandez that's one good thing at least I transferred him out I suppose but it's just embarrassing it's it gets to the point as a United fan and I love man united I really do it's embarrassing seeing the fans booing I don't like that I think that's not I I mean I understand why they're doing it but I don't like it it's embarrassing um but it's embarrassing from from a United fan because it's almost like the whole of the Premier League of mocking us because the whole of the Premier League knows what's wrong I can see what's wrong but United don't seem to be fixing the problems so and um you know so many issues to solve out anyway I'm going to read H everyone in the chat um yeah so much for so much for Casmir having a great season looking his best Jason got a laugh yeah I predicted that didn't I um second half it was Liverpool sto playing yeah it's 3-0 let's be honest Liverpool could have subbed off their whole first 11 and brought on their kids and the game would have still won it still would have ended 3-0 and and I don't and no slave Scaro can play 90 minutes mate gacho can play 90 minutes there none his crap something is in ten ha's head saying I've got to keep Marcus rashford on the left and it's not all Marcus rash's fault it's not Marcus rash's fault it's not all down to him the end of the day it's the person that chooses him to play I do agree with that and he doesn't look interested the amount of times the ball gets fed down the left hand side to mark rashford what does he do he turns back around and he plays it back to one of the midfielders or back to the defender I'm sorry but if you're a Winger and you're you're hugging that left hand touch line and you get given the ball your job is to take on that fullback and get to the by line and try and whip a ball in or do what he used to do and try and cut in into the box and create a goal scoring opportunity which he was good at doing two seasons ago but what do you do steo if you got a player that's banging out a form and he hasn't been doing anything for multiple multiple months I mean what we're talking 14 15 months steo you're a manager you got a player you've given him a chance you've given him a chance right everyone all the fans are on the back going time to drop him you got players on the fringes want to come in you got you got talented youngsters coming through what' you do steo if you got a player that's that that was in the first 11 that's no longer performing or doing anything for the team not tracking back not performing any positive actions for the team what do you do steo as a manager you pretty much dropping right and what manager how many managers badges have you got shiff leader at Tesco okay yeah so it's just it's just embarrassing anyway moving on hello to dread FPL to John hey hello to Scott uh Scotland Vester Le bonil is here men and blacks here um Alex is here clickers is here um Dan's here second oh yeah um PK 7's here um I it's just yeah what [ __ ] day for FPL um for me anyway um steo I'm done talking now for the rest of the stream you can go ahead and take it take it away I don't think it's been a bad day for you you had two out of your four players returned today Jackson and e oh come on Jackson got yellow card he's he's still scored he's still got one bonus point I'll I'll be honest with you Jay i' I've hit the wild card I had to get rid of a lot of dead wood in my team and after watching today I've decided that I cannot go without go without Salah no no no no no that if if anybody in the first three game weeks predicted howand and Salah to have exactly the same points I mean yeah there are people that can take a a guess that I think that this Salah will outperform hen by this amount or whatever but the way the way these worldclass freaks of nature have come through with double digit triple digit quadruple digit Halls is absurd the the goals that were scored today by Liverpool absolutely perfect oh yeah they they were but I'm sorry they were they were they were taken wild goals yeah on a g but but on a given but on a given game week they're not going to be gifted that that many chances no and this is this is exactly the point salah's goal that he scored just pinpoint accuracy the same as Diaz's first one or was it the second one no it was the second one wasn't it was it the header he scored it was the first one wasn't it the header uh second I can't remember now that was the second goal that was the second was it so the first one absolute pinpoint accuracy same as salah's one as well the header by Diaz absolute perfection don't get me wrong Diaz of the of the front three for Liverpool obviously number one is s Diaz is by far number two slot only took him off to be like I'm just going to give you a rest mate you've performed so well today if I'm a Diego J owner which I'm not anymore I'd be seriously concerned about him oh yeah yeah good point I think that even though I Still Believe by gameweek four he's still going to be number one I think Nunes and gapo are gonna have something to say about shter Diaz and Salah are not going anywhere now that other bloke who they've signed I don't know what his name is he ain't going to be taking salah's spot he's gonna be coming on for Salah it's exact is what I was saying to Dan about Sterling he'll be coming in for sacka Sterling ain't gonna be starting any matches and to see Salah return the exact same points as hen when in history jaay can you think when players of high captaincy are getting such a high return and then the second highest highest owned captaincy returns exactly the same I cannot think it's an fbl dream isn't it for people that own both players essentially it's it's just been an amazing start I think 1819 season and who did that involve um that was the season where it was the template was doing amazing it was uh it was the it was a season where I did really well it was the season where Andy Robertson Trent were just scoring like ridiculous points every week out outc Mendy yeah um outscoring I mean it was the it was the one it was that one season where like you had Rees James as well Reese James was bagging in the points it was it was just ridiculous like the template was coming through almost every week for about six game weeks in a row for the first six seven game weeks it was like oh my God I think game week w 101 Point 101 points or 104 points game week two 118 points it was like whoa this I've never played FPL like this before this is ridiculous but yeah I mean people who own people who own Salah and Harland are pulling away you're talking I mean 40 50 points now clear of Rivals in their mini leagues because they are it's not it's not that bad for people that don't for people that don't own against people that don't own them well people that don't own either I Nick Turner yeah he's he's destroy yeah that's what that's what I'm saying I'm saying people that don't own because there are people that have gone out there and be like you know what I'm going to be clever and there was a person and I don't know what it was and it was a person on Sunday surgery and I'm doubtful we'll see them ever again cuz they didn't have Salah Harland in their team we don't even see operators mate so are we going to see so they're they're probably never going to come back into the show again because they didn't have Sal harand and and obviously they're not no I'm joking okay come back on H we would have Lov to hear from you we probably B carded you won't like but you know well anyway um there there's an old saying in it like hit the wild card in game week you'll be happy is that saying God I feel good jaay I I generally feel really good hitting the wild needed to be done I had such the dead wood in my team is as well I might have to I might do that as well to be honest because I've got I've got so much [ __ ] to sort out in my team now look at me I've got Barco Hall I mean I've got Johnson who's not even playing uh I've got Anderson who's getting replaced by keer no but no but no seriousness of [ __ ] de Kevin De bruyer the best midfielder the premier league has ever seen get me one point um anyway um I'll clip that for Tik Tok can we can we just yeah yeah smash that like button subscribe to the channel if you like it around here jump on our Discord disc's full of yeah a very friendly place people should be hitting the like button and subscribe but no no no no you should be smashing it smashing that like button yeah yeah because it gives us gives us that derve and determination to carry on such I mean I've decided to give myself a handicap this week hold on Nick Nick we you we were just slagging you off mate we were literally just slagging you off so yeah yeah he's just in in all seriousness are you genuinely tempted to hit the world yeah mate I am of course I am look at the state of it no it's so better than your team oh well well hold on a minute I only had some dead wood but I needed to do it for the price changes these are F oh the price changes oh the price changes oh well we shall B to the price changes of FPL w betide we don't have the players in before they go up in value because we'll never we'll never catch up to our leag hold on it's more the fat players going down that I'm concerned about in my team Gordon Isaac to name two I can't I can't allow them to drop to be bringing in players that I want and the original plan was going to be doing Pedro in for munes and then I was going to be doing hoping that somehow I could get in Trent Alexander Arnold if not I'd be bringing in Robertson but I realized Newcastle are absolutely atrocious they make man united look like man man city Newcastle are absolutely pants jaay how they won today is beyond me tells me more about Tottenham than it does about Newcastle I have to get rid of Gordon he's gonna be dropping down in price tonight Isaac's another one that looks like he's going to be dropping down in price tonight Newcastle useless I had Le Hall who will not be playing for Newcastle ever again apart from in the Carib Cup and the FA Cup you then have Johnson who as you quite rightly say isn't playing and I'm thinking right I I need to be bringing in some of these players that are really doing let me just bring your team up very quickly because i' I've just realized I've got mine up one second put my wild card team up if you want oh you posted it have you I've put it in Discord teams team yeah team can you say can you can you say that again I put it in teen disc hell I speak another language um I have put it in there and I'm pretty much waiting on Watkins to I see I see you put it in TCO DTS I'm waiting on a Watkins hoping for a double price drop which is unlikely he's going to go down in price tonight but I'm hoping for a double because then I can then bring in Watkins for HS I'm gutted I can't bring in sacka I really wanted to bring in sacka but I can't I I said to fog that I really liked his team and I think double Liverpool defense I mean watching him today I know it was man united but even the last three fixtures they've got a system there which is not allowing anybody to score whatsoever um there was quite clearly two clear chances where United almost had open goals to score yeah yeah yeah in any match and even if you're playing Everton you're going to get an opportunity but their goalkeeper in Allison the player that I had last season that did absolutely nothing for me same as Virgil Van djk this season I think they've had more clean sheets so far this season than when I owned them for the whole of last season that's how bad it was for me I I don't mind don't hate that team I think it's I don't you know it's all right yeah do you want to read out to the to the Martinez in goal Lewis uh Robertson Alexander Arnolds is back three Bremo Diaz pal and SOS and Midfield four and then with a trio of havitz J Pedro and Harland up front I can't see a bench uh your bench is uh let me read it out 3 2 1 fabianski and goal Rogers Robinson and Greaves so nice cheapy bench yeah and this isn't knee jerky these are players in which says these are players in which are fantastic value for their positions like I said ha will become Watkins if Watkins goes down by 02 again unlikely you never know I'm happy with havs to be completely Frank it's a brilliant player he is is performing Miracles along with sacker I don't know what combination they've got going but these two are just on fire and I'm happy to own him if I don't if if I don't have Watkins because Watkins as we discussed yesterday isn't exactly pulling up trees Pedro great Brighton asset Brighton's fixtures are absolutely phenomenal moving forward hen don't need to disc seeno is the interesting one for me Jay seeno his performances for Bournemouth have been apparently he performed really well yesterday as well and their upcoming fix just Chelsea at home I don't have the problem with that at all Dan will be going to that Liverpool away he'll be benched for that but then they got Southampton Leicester in game week six and seven thank you Arsenal at home forget it astonvilla away forget it man city forget it but those three fixtures Chelsea Southampton Leicester can easily play don't have the problem with that whatsoever cuz Fulham Fulham I I still think by all accounts Smith row wasn't particularly great yesterday I still think he's binging beding in and seeno is I believe on penalties as well and burm brenford fixtures once again I don't think he is Rico Lewis tell me about it like is he is he nailed yeah oh he he'll be playing for no matter what he'll be playing and if I feel that he isn't nailed I've got Robinson as back up and GRE Greaves is a starting IP switch Defender he's four million and you know what their fixtures UPC coming if absolutely in Desperate mode they're not that bad up Sal Salah being 12.6 is a pain in the ass yeah I I'm I'm happy to go with the triple Liverpool in Robertson Trent and Diaz those two look so dangerous I did you know not tempted of people doing um Diego jot Diaz and TR yeah yeah I had that I genuinely had Diego jot and Diaz but I just thought J today I didn't think played that particularly great there was a moment when he was put through and he should have and he and he took it on this on the left hand side he did really well got into the box and all he had to do was just Square it to whoever it was he didn't bother he tried to take it on himself and I can imagine slot just thinking um it's been a few times now that you could have hit the I don't know hit the target with a with a shot or whatever but he's not put it on target or in this specific case he could have just simply squar the ball I can't I don't know what minute jot came off it must have been like the 75th minute or something I know Diaz went off first but I'm I'm I can see Diaz so far forward he's he for me is the one that's getting furthest forward out of the out of jotter and Salah and do you remember this conversation was it last year or the year before when we were talking about a particular player being maybe more of a an assist rather than a goal scorer was it Salah we were talking about was it somebody else there was somebody that we said said could be more of the assist because they've got a better quality of Striker ahead of them I can't remember who it was now and I see that in Salah yeah you said it was about Salah didn't you I think it was when um was it Nunes was coming in honest I cannot remember will be all and then obviously that you jinxed him because then he ended up being an absolute fail yes so I'm look if I could get Sal team I would but there are certain players I want to get in which I I just can't sacka being one of them now the plan will be is to potentially be getting rid of Palmer for sacka in gameweek six and seven however however I am very very tempted very tempted by around the gameweek six Mark to possibly possibly move on haland possibly their fixtures game week five Arsenal at home Newcastle the way then they got Fulham wolf Southampton it's almost committing a sin so actually looking at that I'm not going to be doing that whatsoever I think that's just absolute Madness now thinking about it now looking at there but trying to get sacarin the only way I can do it is by getting in Palmer and Palmer's fixture proof along with the the Liverpool boys same as in Burma I think a buros pretty much fix approve his fixtures themselves in brenford Man City away they always give up opportunities Spurs away he I think I think brentford's got a really good record against Spurs actually West Ham at home Wolves at home man united away I switch at home Sil at home these are beautiful fixtures you're not obviously not interested in Onis son then anymore Tottenham Tottenham again I did not see anything from Tottenham whatsoever where I think oh my God I wish I own that player who was it on the I think it was Mark goldbridge he said the problem with Tottenham is that they need this is why they need salanki up front and until we see salanki consistently for Tottenham I can't make a decision on how son Madison Johnson koseski will fit around salanki whatsoever or OD de bear nowadays so Sun's always guaranteed to play we know this but I've not seen I I'll continue saying this sun getting those two goals against Everton was very fortuitous very fortuitous and Tottenham so far what they won one game against Everton 4-0 they drew the opening day 1-1 with Leicester when they should have been at least two n up at halim and then they lose today 2-1 to an absolute abject Newcastle team that literally looked like they cannot be bothered to play now don't get me wrong Isaac in the opening what was it the only five minutes 10 minutes he did a deliberate cross come shot just trying to chip the goalkeeper an inch lower he's scoring it Isaac could have come away with a double- digit Hall today yeah but and Bremo a city away next fixture you um just playing him playing I couldn't care less it's either him or um Rogers at home to Everton but it's literally a toss of a coin between them two to be completely Frank it really doesn't bother me whatsoever like you said Rogers is five million whatever yeah whereas and Burma he's on penalties brenford are going to set up with that what was it what was it when they're away from home they play a 532 or something like that I can't remember now or a 442 I can't quite remember what it is but they'll be trying to hit City on the counter but again that'll be just a decision that I make on on the day but we got two weeks now two weeks Chase two weeks to be mulling over but I think that you're probably going to end up wild carding again you're going to be ending up wild carding now How likely are you going to wild card because I think you're about 98% there I'm not going to lie mate I'm looking at this team I'm and again a lot of it's I I have to agree with you I mean looking at the value that some of these players bring some of them I mean annoyingly a lot have gone up in value um but for example um hang on very good Luke I like I like the office reference there very good very um fleen what do you think of fleen well this is the thing for me I was really really tempted to do what Fire's done which is a fleen and vuan rotation pairing you got you got Martinez which got some really nice fixtures well this is the thing I I I I need that Aston Villa coverage but flecking and ver bruan it is a really really good double up and I mean really good if you look at it you've got the bruan has Brighton at home sorry IP switch at home first then it's Notting the forest at home and then you can just go to fleen where he's got West H Wolves at home then you go to then you can keep oh yeah yeah yeah until Brighton and then they've got Brighton and nip switch they you know I am very very invested in that and there's a small possibility it may end up with me getting rid of Martinez getting rid of Robinson doing the fleen and ver bruan and conza in for Robinson instead but the good thing the good thing Jace with this gameweek four wild card is that there I personally think there's going to be quite a few assets assets going down in price and that's why I I want to just do a world card now get the players in that I want because and Burma's going up in price tonight Diaz is I'm I'm I'm looking at this here and I'm I'm looking at um what I can do okay let's hear it and I'm almost ready to share with you mate just just share it because it's just uh hang on I'm nearly there I'm just need to find one five a five million or I mean i' does he need to be five million Defender it depends who your starting Defenders are in what formation well be it'll be Alexander Arnold right Lewis yeah and you don't know who the other 4.5 I don't know well I got thinking of daa maybe not a bad shout Dena he's not gonna play he's he's gonna be slowly out really yeah de deor isn't gonna be a a star I don't think for Aston Villa I could be completely wrong which normally I am but de chat yeah I mean chat yeah this is what this is the good thing is chat can tell us well is Walker not going to take ls's place says Luke in the chat no Walker when he came on yesterday didn't take over Lewis's spot Lewis is a versatility man I think pet Gua is um is absolutely loving Lewis and his development and I don't see any reason why pet would drop him he's done nothing wrong if anything he's I don't see much I don't see much in value of five million or under Defenders I really don't no but like you said it doesn't have to be five million doesn't it doesn't have to be five million what do you mean well I'm looking at budget budget Defenders I don't see a lot of Great Value in in I don't see I mean okay you got Robinson's gone up in Valley which is annoying that is annoying but what what's your team as it stands right now what what wild card okay so it'd be so I'll do the I like the I don't I like the vgan fleen so just put that there for the moment and they got Lewis Alexander Arnold daa but that could be someone else Diaz e jota and Bremo say that again Diaz e jot and bromo hav Watkins harand Watkins Holland havs Watkins and harand oh you you you would have um right okay okay and who are your budget three players in defense and Midfield it be Rogers yeah Johnson well John you can replace him with like GRE oh yeah sorry yeah who he plays for rips which is the Zack of the same team but he's a guarante he's a center back guaranteed I I got two 4.5 million players to bring in for two Defenders 4.5 million uh I'm thinking of maseri just have man united cover don't you um and maybe leis dunk is that too much having for Bren and dunk no I don't think so so this would be my team I'll stick up on the screen uh in fact I'll put in the Discord team screenshots for you to see steo five 4 3 2 one you should be able to see it there chat you should be able to see me paste this in here that would be my team oh I think you can't really see it there hang on just put it onto the screen SEC Talk Amongst yourselves ladies and gentlemen Talk Amongst yourselves that would be my team there oh you you'd be having the Man United defender in mazari yeah yeah why is that considering you just absolutely slammed man united you you're going with a man united asset what's that all about I I do like the look of him he had a cracking shot today oh the one through the legs yeah I do like him I do think he's a very attack-minded player much more attacking than Waka how the will you be bringing in an Arsenal oh you got havs haven't you not concerned about sacka well can't have more can you Chelsea Chelsea yes but Palmer's too much money I mean I could go do the whole Jackson keep Jackson and save my money there and spread it elsewhere in Midfield but if I I could free 1.5 million having Jackson instead of Watkins but um consideration but yeah I'm not having Salah or not having Salah is it going to bite us all in the in the in the ass essentially well if you put Salah in that team you're going to have to restructure everything because he comes in for let's just say jotter then you won't be able to have no I won't be able to have I won't be able to have havs no okay let's just let's build a harand Salah team so it' be Jackson out havit out and it'll be um it be Pedro in and it would be um say wher um oh my God everyone's gone up in value steo I I know they've gone up in value that's why I'm making sure that I don't lose value oh my God how much have you lost in money 0.1 0.2 uh how do I uh one sec I one one 100.6 and I got 0.1 in the bank well that's your team value but you must have what players have you you must have lost 0.1 on Fernandez on E only only on E on E right okay so you got rid of Fernandez before he had a price drop correct that's really good that's really good so you Pedro Jackson Harland and then I would go Jo J out Salah in which then I need to free up oh wow I can I can do this I can do this quite easily wow steo I'm I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this give me a moment give me a momento um fabianski I'll put you back in uh best 4.5 goalkeeper chat fleen veran sells of Nottingham Forest Fabian what's the news on arola anybody in chat news on arola best 4.5 chat when incredibly I'm looking at this V bruan and fleen double up okay and I actually prefer it to just having Martinez and I'd rather than have a conza from Villa instead well it would mean having taken out oh my God in fact I can even get rid of [Music] Greaves if I stuck with this team and not worry about Watkins because blazy makes a point here that Watkins you can't really justify his price currently I completely agree what Jackson at 7.5 he a 7.5 is he arola hurt his back is that it is that all he did is Jackson worth 7.5 million again if you're happy to I don't have a problem with him is is he a guaranteed starter I don't know I I don't I'm not a Chelsea aicio unfortunately but I must say that I do like the vuan and fleen double up I think that's I think that's the move for me in fact I'm even going to do that right now I'm going to do that right this second confirm transfers that's done and I do agree with chat they're saying about Lewis being dropped being dropped for the Arsenal game yeah it it probably will happen but his value is just skyrocketing he's gonna be going up in price again Sano is a good pick in he yeah yeah he stands out at his price Point 5.5 is on penalties you say yes and Kevin Kelly making a point here it's not a bad one Kevin K instead of 2.5 two 4.5 goalkeepers would it not be better to have Ry and 14 million that equals the same 9.5 doesn't equal it doesn't equal nine unfortunately if if it was a five goalkeeper brilliant unfortunately it's not it's a 5.5 I'm close to maybe working out something magical here steo well if you actually hit your no no no I haven't hit it yet if I come if I find something really magical here then I think it's don't matter I think I have to um let's quickly look Defenders what Defenders do I really want in my team that are going to get me loads of points Ric Lewis I mean for the price point I can see why you've done it I really can he's cheap and he's playing um he's got brenford next he's got brenford next a dread maker a point jotter next week could be the one getting the points and Diaz blanking I don't think Diaz is blanked at all this season I think Diaz has returned in every single match so far and the answer is all right away I switch nothing three points but then he's got a four that's ridiculous a 14 and a 15 pointer was he Visa a good option yeah cheap 6 million guaranteed to play for for for brenford absolutely nailed absolutely Ned gravy Dave said I'm gonna be going with pal Torres well gravy Dave is um doing extremely well in the YouTube chat League fire talk saying Jason is stealing all of Steve's different R ma madai madai played 85 minutes today and he looked good did you watch the game did you well I just I heard I heard about it I didn't watch game saying best defense is surely Trent Robertson and poro and then work from that madai ladies and gentlemen what would you what do you say about madai Blaze he certainly looks sharp I like I think um okay this is this is looking op as as hell this is looking scary this team that I've assembled The Avengers essentially oh my God okay um goalkeeper ryer in go would you rather have ryer in goal than Becca than Allison yeah oh yeah I'd have Ray in goal yeah but then again that's only because Liverpool have burnt me so much yeah I'll probably have Ray I'd rather take ryer personally isn't he 0. five more expensive or they I don't even know same same the same are they W Beck's 5.6 do you know welbeck's got two goals and assist so far y yep I'm fully aware right I'm I'm going to send you a screen I'm going to show you this team and this is actually quite scary okay on the Discord team screenshots yeah this is actually quite a scary team chat I want you honest opinions of this team because I think I may have found an OP team that is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous can you see that on screen when you put it in Discord I'll be able to see it that's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous R Fabian mazari oh my God D Diaz Medi Salah I know right it looks like you can't afford it double Brighton well no because you gone double Brighton attack and haland yes but I but I was over that OD to take whale back and go with a a two a 352 formation Rock a 352 the problem is that you're then going to be what you said against I mean don't get wrong on paper I'm looking at thinking good Lord that's ridiculous def brighten attack you have a laugh you're having a laugh well I can get yujo 4.5 and then just put the 1.2 into the rest the team somewhere like who I don't even know where I would upgrade um so if I if I was to go yo as a as a third Striker that I would never play could I suppose I could just move Pedro out I got 6.8 then I the uh how much his havocs now 8.1 Alexander saying wellbe has a trap over the seasons he has been a form SLP Purple Patch player has a couple of good games and then disappears James making the point you've got too much Squad depth Rams 4.4 South Hampton there PL of shots not at him that's a shame that team is how much was e again 6.9 6.9 now what were you going to say sorry Ste on paper this team I look at I think how the hell have you come up with that hang on I've got an idea on paper that is a um a quite a a frightening team see is E's going to go back up again is he I'm assuming he'll be at some point over the international break will go back up to S million so I don't want to be getting him gone um but that is I mean I'm gonna I'm going to send you another team now which is I mean I'm gonna send you another team which uh again is quite disgusting um Alex swe say no Newcastle that's a good thing no Spurs that's a good thing okay what about this is this a is this a more balanced team here we go um people saying about Rico Le being a huge W it's it's the money game at the moment what about this team steo Rico Lewis is the money game so we got Martinez in goal it's my old team isn't it yeah um Trent de dun Le ma um I got e though oh 352 yeah e instead of seeno again I've got nothing against this whatsoever I mean it's it looks pretty powerful the only downside is that if one of your players doesn't play and Ojo is your well no be a Defender that comes no I know that but that's the problem but what if Lewis doesn't play oo I mean there are technically potential risks over Pedro again these players are still GNA come on and play ujo is definitely Never Gonna Play in a million years but all the other players it's again I look at it and go it's is that excellent there's no Arsenal which [Music] is no Arsenal there is no Arsenal but at the end of the day like you've just stated you can't have them more and you've got both howand and Salah how much is Rogers five fire talk saying what did you say yesterday about having a deep bench precisely Matthew Z is saying get rid of Diaz and Welbeck what's the situation on Michael Keane he played 90 minutes playing because braith weight is out I don't know how long braith weight is out for but he's playing he's playing for now yeah but I have no idea how long braith weight is out for but he is right now playing what's the popular picks at 4 million at the moment there's not is there really for a Defender maybe Aston Ville is nego jovic his name is but he again he didn't even start yesterday unfortunately he's played 11 minutes hardw Bellis he has hardwood Bellis is he playing every game he should be 55 if you look at his yeah minutes he was brought off early the other day and then yesterday was brought off very early was Jan bedner who's getting every game yeah bner I should say he's getting every game Scotland rester saying I want to see Jason make a decision for himself without no outside influence good yeah good point um Bednar is probably better Ben is saying Paulie and Dan saying Greaves player that I've got but that does your team again looks extraordinary with Salah in it incredible there's no 4.4 Strikers is there no no no no no no and they never will be they'll never go down in price not enough people own them and yeah 352 in this particular game so far with the amount of options in Midfield that I think that there you could go into you know going to the end of this stream with that team that you've got in front of me with Martin has Fab Ani Etc and then you could just re-evaluate in a week's time I think I may have got another combination of players that could be genuinely could be really good um okay this is this is a again a different a different one um I might think this is actually oh this is quite is there is there is there a five million I mean Ric Lewis is it's too good to ignore any yeah let's be honest let's be honest right what do you think of this one steo I've just posted there [Music] with I think you made the team weaker what having havit in it yeah havit and Rogers over who was it and bermo and Pedro yeah I mean IP switch net for Brighton I think you've got to a point now where you're overthinking I think genuinely you go back to the one just above that leave it for a week and then we come back within Burma in the one within Burma yeah yeah and then I can upgrade bed to oh my God that's Rari well yeah um yeah M Masari whatever his name is and then I could yeah I can just reassess it I got point three in the bank and this is the point reassess in a week and that's exactly what I'm going to be doing point three in the bank and then what play what players are actually going up tonight there's a lot of players going up tonight is there yeah and one of them is going to be in fact a lot of Pedro Harem well Beck's going up but remember if you bring if you menu is going up you want to be making sure that you the players that are going up you've gotten your team now yeah in case you want them proper because if not you've just missed out on them you're not going to make any money on them yeah in the sense of profit but at least you'll Smith Row for me nah fulam useless um I think in all honesty the only one is Welbeck but I don't know like if I think if you got Pedro you don't have Welbeck as well this is Sunday surgery fire talk it's called ripping our teams to Pieces because they're that bad and redoing them mo saying Hampton defense isn't very good look look at the match against brenford they were just stupid mistakes Absolut stupid mistakes Henderson is not a bad chat at 4.5 is he let's be honest Crystal Palace he's not that bad not a bad show no fulam will finish above United this year they look great they really don't they're not that great they're not that great they're a good team they ain't going to be finishing above Pham Me Above man united not going to be happening not gonna be happening that Jason I thought we wanted to get off here for an hour after an hour yeah I do I need I need to go really but I'm just I'm I'm mesmerized at this I'm literally mesmerized oh my God why would I want well backck in my team steo can you tell me tell you what sorry can you tell me why I would want Welbeck in my team uh Brighton's got good fixtures they're in a very very attacking team and Pedro he's one of the focal points but would I want both players in my team no again I I I say we re-evaluate this but but and there is a butt don't laugh steo don't laugh there is there is a butt if if masera is going up okay and then I just have a 4 One Defender who why did R face go is it is it R face why did he go up because he scored a goal that's the only reason he went up yeah against Aston Villa that cost me clean sheets it's fixed as are R awful is it even a good option I don't even know Leicester would you own a Leicester Defender I think of the three teams they're probably the the better equipped to keep a clean sheet right last this is the last screenshot steo and this is purely for Price rises in mind okay purely for Price rises in mind and I can switch it out uh I'm going to I'm going to put the uh the team in and I'm thinking of it myself it's not a bad team is it not a bad team mate uh is it sticking with Henderson and then we've got this is [ __ ] insane team to be honest but it's just pretty much identical to I actually personally prefer the one above what the one well back's price RIS I mean I mean I prefer the one with the double so Ray and goal yeah and then the the Midfield and then whatnot I prefer that team what's the difference are you what no no but no you'd hang on you'd rather have Rogers instead ofo no no there's so many bloody combinations here it's going to take me forever to be able to work this out but the latest one you've got double bright attack and bumo medek as a Sal again this is just based for Price Rises it's benching headaches for you isn't it I love it I love this team uh CJ team two weeks magical well back Pedro M and choose one he's nailed 4.0 so he's nailed 4.0 and everyone sold Barco what do you mean regarding face F oh right okay now okay okay okay loving the stream

t thees free just for tonight free just for hello good evening guys good evening so out of sight and out of snow out of sight and out of mind hi look the intro was different because today is for me its a somber day for football muhammad salah coming around and punishing so many fpr man honestly i dont even want to be here right now to be honest i dont like i said steo just do a solo mate just do a solo like what have i got why would i want to relive the events of today i dont want to i watched that game today and it was just like ive had bad moments as a united fan but my god and then and then to the icing on the cake the icing on the cake in that game they take off arguably our best player in garnacho tenh hark and they leave rashford on and i havent seen mark goldbridge and im pretty damn sure mark goldbridge has talked about it and this isnt about united this is about fpl but i am absolutely furious at ten hog and i want him gone he needs to go he hasnt got a clue has not got a clue the players are completely clueless as to what theyre meant to be doing in the team casamero i just i dont know its like its almost like hes its not just his legs that have gone but his ability to read the game has gone like you get these world class players steo theyve played all their careers theyve reached the top of their game won champions leagues their legs start to go but at least at least theyve still got their head and they canot anticipate and they can still work things out and they can make up for the fact theyre not fast because they can read the game and maybe intercept and standoff players no he was his touch was terrible his vision was nonexistent what the hell he was trying to do playing the pool out getting it was like he was in treal he was like he was stuck in treal and he just couldnt move and the united defense was exposed though time and time again and again this isnt about united but the fact is im here to talk about football and the first thing i want to talk about is that shower of that was man united versus liverpool h and liverpool fans out there youre watching i know youre watching you cant say you played very well you cant say you were on top of your game it was handed you on the plate it was absolutely handed you on the plate it was embarrassing you didnt even have to work to score a goal the amount of chances liverpool had where they created themselves and fudged it up i lost count but every single time united fudged up liverpool was there to pay to pick him off what am i trying to say what im trying to say is remove the mistakes in that game from united that games ending nil salah was very good dont get me wrong the ball over the top to the back post was very good but that came from a mistake came from a mistake all right and ten hog needs to go he needs to go hes not shown hes three games in and im already saying he needs to go hes showing absolutely no sign that hes learning from the lessons of last season keeping rashford on keeping staying with casemiro for as long as he did bruno fernandez thats one good thing at least i transferred him out but its just embarrassing its it gets to the point as a united fan and i love man united i do its embarrassing seeing the fans booing i dont like that i think thats not i i understand why theyre doing it but i dont like its embarrassing but its embarrassing from a united fan because its almost like the whole of the premier league of mocking us because the whole of the premier league knows whats wrong i can see whats wrong but united dont seem to be fixing the problems so and so many issues to solve out anyway im going to read h everyone in the chat so much for so much for casmir having a great season looking his best jason got a laugh i predicted that didnt i second half it was liverpool sto playing its 30 lets be honest liverpool could have subbed off their whole first 11 and brought on their kids and the game would have still won it still would have ended 30 and i dont and no slave scaro can play 90 minutes mate gacho can play 90 minutes there none his crap something is in ten has head saying ive got to keep marcus rashford on the left and its not all marcus rashs fault its not marcus rashs fault its not all down to him the end of the day its the person that chooses him to play i do agree with that and he doesnt look interested the amount of times the ball gets fed down the left hand side to mark rashford what does he do he turns back around and he plays it back to one of the midfielders or back to the defender im sorry but if youre a winger and youre youre hugging that left hand touch line and you get given the ball your job is to take on that fullback and get to the by line and try and whip a ball in or do what he used to do and try and cut in into the box and create a goal scoring opportunity which he was good at doing two seasons ago but what do you do steo if you got a player thats banging out a form and he hasnt been doing anything for multiple months what were talking 14 15 months steo youre a manager you got a player youve given him a chance youve given him a chance right everyone all the fans are on the back going time to drop him you got players on the fringes want to come in you got you got talented youngsters coming through what you do steo if you got a player thats that was in the first 11 thats no longer performing or doing anything for the team not tracking back not performing any positive actions for the team what do you do steo as a manager you pretty much dropping right and what manager how many managers badges have you got shiff leader at tesco okay so its just its just embarrassing anyway moving on hello to dread fpl to john hey hello to scott scotland vester le bonil is here men and blacks here alex is here clickers is here dans here second pk 7s here i its just what day for fpl for me anyway steo im done talking now for the rest of the stream you can go ahead and take it take it away i dont think its been a bad day for you had two out of your four players returned today jackson and e come on jackson got yellow card hes hes still scored hes still got one bonus point ill ill be honest with you jay i ive hit the wild card i had to get rid of a lot of dead wood in my team and after watching today ive decided that i cannot go without go without salah no that if anybody in the first three game weeks predicted howand and salah to have exactly the same points there are people that can take a guess that i think that this salah will outperform hen by this amount or whatever but the way the way these worldclass freaks of nature have come through with double digit triple digit quadruple digit halls is absurd the goals that were scored today by liverpool absolutely perfect they were but im sorry they were they were they were taken wild goals on a g but on a given but on a given game week theyre not going to be gifted that many chances no and this is this is exactly the point salahs goal that he scored just pinpoint accuracy the same as diazs first one or was it the second one no it was the second one wasnt it was it the header he scored it was the first one wasnt it the header second i cant remember now that was the second goal that was the second was it so the first one absolute pinpoint accuracy same as salahs one as well the header by diaz absolute perfection dont get me wrong diaz of the of the front three for liverpool number one is s diaz is by far number two slot only took him off to be like im just going to give you a rest mate youve performed so well today if im a diego j owner which im not anymore id be seriously concerned about him good point i think that even though i still believe by gw four hes still going to be number one i think nunes and gapo are gonna have something to say about shter diaz and salah are not going anywhere now that other bloke who theyve signed i dont know what his name is he aint going to be taking salahs spot hes gonna be coming on for salah its exact is what i was saying to dan about sterling hell be coming in for sacka sterling aint gonna be starting any matches and to see salah return the exact same points as hen when in history jaay can you think when players of high captaincy are getting such a high return and then the second highest owned captaincy returns exactly the same i cannot think its an fbl dream isnt it for people that own both players essentially its its just been an amazing start i think 1819 season and who did that involve that was the season where it was the template was doing amazing it was it was the it was a season where i did well it was the season where andy robertson trent were just scoring like ridiculous points every week out outc mendy outscoring it was the it was the one it was that one season where like you had rees james as well reese james was bagging in the points it was it was just ridiculous like the template was coming through almost every week for about six game weeks in a row for the first six seven game weeks it was like my god i think game week w 101 point 101 points or 104 points game week two 118 points it was like whoa this ive never played fpl like this before this is ridiculous but people who own people who own salah and harland are pulling away youre talking 40 50 points now clear of rivals in their mini leagues because they are its not its not that bad for people that dont for people that dont own against people that dont own them well people that dont own either i nick turner hes hes destroy thats what thats what im saying im saying people that dont own because there are people that have gone out there and be like what im going to be clever and there was a person and i dont know what it was and it was a person on sunday surgery and im doubtful well see them ever again cuz they didnt have salah harland in their team we dont even see operators mate so are we going to see so theyre theyre probably never going to come back into the show again because they didnt have sal harand and theyre not no im joking okay come back on h we would have lov to hear from you we probably b carded you wont like well anyway theres an old saying in it like hit the wild card in game week youll be happy is that saying god i feel good jaay i generally feel good hitting the wild needed to be done i had such the dead wood in my team is as well i might have to i might do that as well to be honest because ive got ive got so much to sort out in my team now look at me ive got barco hall ive got johnson whos not even playing ive got anderson whos getting replaced by keer no but no but no seriousness of de kevin de bruyer the best midfielder the premier league has ever seen get me one point anyway ill clip that for tik tok can we can we just smash that like button subscribe to the channel if you like it around here jump on our discord discs full of a very friendly place people should be hitting the like button and subscribe but no you should be smashing it smashing that like button because it gives us gives us that derve and determination to carry on such ive decided to give myself a handicap this week hold on nick we you we were just slagging you off mate we were just slagging you off so hes just in all seriousness are you genuinely tempted to hit the world mate i am of course i am look at the state of it no its so better than your team well hold on a minute i only had some dead wood but i needed to do it for the price changes these are f the price changes the price changes well we shall b to the price changes of fpl w betide we dont have the players in before they go up in value because well never well never catch up to our leag hold on its more the fat players going down that im concerned about in my team gordon isaac to name two i cant i cant allow them to drop to be bringing in players that i want and the original plan was going to be doing pedro in for munes and then i was going to be doing hoping that somehow i could get in trent alexander arnold if not id be bringing in robertson but i realized newcastle are absolutely atrocious they make man united look like man city newcastle are absolutely pants jaay how they won today is beyond me tells me more about tottenham than it does about newcastle i have to get rid of gordon hes gonna be dropping down in price tonight isaacs another one that looks like hes going to be dropping down in price tonight newcastle useless i had le hall who will not be playing for newcastle ever again apart from in the carib cup and the fa cup you then have johnson who as you quite rightly say isnt playing and im thinking right i need to be bringing in some of these players that are doing let me just bring your team up very quickly because i ive just realized ive got mine up one second put my wild card team up if you want you posted it have you ive put it in discord teams team team can you say can you can you say that again i put it in teen disc hell i speak another language i have put it in there and im pretty much waiting on watkins to i see i see you put it in tco dts im waiting on a watkins hoping for a double price drop which is unlikely hes going to go down in price tonight but im hoping for a double because then i can then bring in watkins for hs im gutted i cant bring in sacka i wanted to bring in sacka but i cant i said to fog that i liked his team and i think double liverpool defense watching him today i know it was man united but even the last three fixtures theyve got a system there which is not allowing anybody to score whatsoever there was quite clearly two clear chances where united almost had open goals to score in any match and even if youre playing everton youre going to get an opportunity but their goalkeeper in allison the player that i had last season that did absolutely nothing for me same as virgil van djk this season i think theyve had more clean sheets so far this season than when i owned them for the whole of last season thats how bad it was for me i dont mind dont hate that team i think its i dont its all right do you want to read out to the to the martinez in goal lewis robertson alexander arnolds is back three bremo diaz pal and sos and midfield four and then with a trio of havitz j pedro and harland up front i cant see a bench your bench is let me read it out 3 2 1 fabianski and goal rogers robinson and greaves so nice cheapy bench and this isnt knee jerky these are players in which says these are players in which are fantastic value for their positions like i said ha will become watkins if watkins goes down by 02 again unlikely you never know im happy with havs to be completely frank its a brilliant player he is performing miracles along with sacker i dont know what combination theyve got going but these two are just on fire and im happy to own him if i dont if i dont have watkins because watkins as we discussed yesterday isnt exactly pulling up trees pedro great brighton asset brightons fixtures are absolutely phenomenal moving forward hen dont need to disc seeno is the interesting one for me jay seeno his performances for bournemouth have been apparently he performed well yesterday as well and their upcoming fix just chelsea at home i dont have the problem with that at all dan will be going to that liverpool away hell be benched for that but then they got southampton leicester in game week six and seven thank you arsenal at home forget it astonvilla away forget it man city forget it but those three fixtures chelsea southampton leicester can easily play dont have the problem with that whatsoever cuz fulham i still think by all accounts smith row wasnt particularly great yesterday i still think hes binging beding in and seeno is i believe on penalties as well and burm brenford fixtures once again i dont think he is rico lewis tell me about it like is he is he nailed hell be playing for no matter what hell be playing and if i feel that he isnt nailed ive got robinson as back up and gre greaves is a starting ip switch defender hes four million and what their fixtures upc coming if absolutely in desperate mode theyre not that bad up sal salah being 126 is a pain in the ass im im happy to go with the triple liverpool in robertson trent and diaz those two look so dangerous i did not tempted of people doing diego jot diaz and tr i had that i genuinely had diego jot and diaz but i just thought j today i didnt think played that particularly great there was a moment when he was put through and he should have and he and he took it on this on the left hand side he did well got into the box and all he had to do was just square it to whoever it was he didnt bother he tried to take it on himself and i can imagine slot just thinking its been a few times now that you could have hit the i dont know hit the target with a with a shot or whatever but hes not put it on target or in this specific case he could have just simply squar the ball i cant i dont know what minute jot came off it must have been like the 75th minute i know diaz went off first but im im i can see diaz so far forward hes he for me is the one thats getting furthest forward out of the out of jotter and salah and do you remember this conversation was it last year or the year before when we were talking about a particular player being maybe more of a an assist rather than a goal scorer was it salah we were talking about was it somebody else there was somebody that we said could be more of the assist because theyve got a better quality of striker ahead of them i cant remember who it was now and i see that in salah you said it was about salah didnt you i think it was when was it nunes was coming in honest i cannot remember will be all and then that you jinxed him because then he ended up being an absolute fail yes so im look if i could get sal team i would but there are certain players i want to get in which i just cant sacka being one of them now the plan will be is to potentially be getting rid of palmer for sacka in gw six and seven however i am very tempted very tempted by around the gw six mark to possibly move on haland possibly their fixtures game week five arsenal at home newcastle the way then they got fulham wolf southampton its almost committing a sin so looking at that im not going to be doing that whatsoever i think thats just absolute madness now thinking about it now looking at there but trying to get sacarin the only way i can do it is by getting in palmer and palmers fixture proof along with the liverpool boys same as in burma i think a buros pretty much fix approve his fixtures themselves in brenford man city away they always give up opportunities spurs away he i think i think brentfords got a good record against spurs west ham at home wolves at home man united away i switch at home sil at home these are beautiful fixtures youre not not interested in onis son then anymore tottenham again i did not see anything from tottenham whatsoever where i think my god i wish i own that player who was it on the i think it was mark goldbridge he said the problem with tottenham is that they need this is why they need salanki up front and until we see salanki consistently for tottenham i cant make a decision on how son madison johnson koseski will fit around salanki whatsoever or od de bear nowadays so suns always guaranteed to play we know this but ive not seen ill continue saying this sun getting those two goals against everton was very fortuitous very fortuitous and tottenham so far what they won one game against everton 40 they drew the opening day 11 with leicester when they should have been at least two n up at halim and then they lose today 21 to an absolute abject newcastle team that looked like they cannot be bothered to play now dont get me wrong isaac in the opening what was it the only five minutes 10 minutes he did a deliberate cross come shot just trying to chip the goalkeeper an inch lower hes scoring it isaac could have come away with a double digit hall today but and bremo a city away next fixture you just playing him playing i couldnt care less its either him or rogers at home to everton but its a toss of a coin between them two to be completely frank it doesnt bother me whatsoever like you said rogers is five million whatever whereas and burma hes on penalties brenford are going to set up with that what was it what was it when theyre away from home they play a 532 like that i cant remember now or a 442 i cant quite remember what it is but theyll be trying to hit city on the counter but again thatll be just a decision that i make on the day but we got two weeks now two weeks chase two weeks to be mulling over but i think that youre probably going to end up wild carding again youre going to be ending up wild carding now how likely are you going to wild card because i think youre about 98 there im not going to lie mate im looking at this team im and again a lot of its i have to agree with you looking at the value that some of these players bring some of them annoyingly a lot have gone up in value but for example hang on very good luke i like i like the office reference there very good very fleen what do you think of fleen well this is the thing for me i was tempted to do what fires done which is a fleen and vuan rotation pairing you got you got martinez which got some nice fixtures well this is the thing i need that aston villa coverage but flecking and ver bruan it is a good double up and good if you look at it youve got the bruan has brighton at home sorry ip switch at home first then its notting the forest at home and then you can just go to fleen where hes got west h wolves at home then you go to then you can keep until brighton and then theyve got brighton and nip switch they i am very invested in that and theres a small possibility it may end up with me getting rid of martinez getting rid of robinson doing the fleen and ver bruan and conza in for robinson instead but the good thing the good thing jace with this gw four wild card is that there i personally think theres going to be quite a few assets going down in price and thats why i want to just do a world card now get the players in that i want because and burmas going up in price tonight diaz is im im im looking at this here and im im looking at what i can do okay lets hear it and im almost ready to share with you mate just share it because its just hang on im nearly there im just need to find one five a five million or i does he need to be five million defender it depends who your starting defenders are in what formation well be itll be alexander arnold right lewis and you dont know who the other 45 i dont know well i got thinking of daa maybe not a bad shout dena hes not gonna play hes hes gonna be slowly out de deor isnt gonna be a star i dont think for aston villa i could be completely wrong which normally i am but de chat chat this is what this is the good thing is chat can tell us well is walker not going to take lss place says luke in the chat no walker when he came on yesterday didnt take over lewiss spot lewis is a versatility man i think pet gua is is absolutely loving lewis and his development and i dont see any reason why pet would drop him hes done nothing wrong if anything hes i dont see much i dont see much in value of five million or under defenders i dont no but like you said it doesnt have to be five million doesnt it doesnt have to be five million what do you mean well im looking at budget defenders i dont see a lot of great value in i dont see okay you got robinsons gone up in valley which is annoying that is annoying but whats your team as it stands right now what wild card okay so itd be so ill do the i like the i dont i like the vgan fleen so just put that there for the moment and they got lewis alexander arnold daa but that could be someone else diaz e jota and bremo say that again diaz e jot and bromo hav watkins harand watkins holland havs watkins and harand you would have right okay and who are your budget three players in defense and midfield it be rogers johnson well john you can replace him with like gre sorry who he plays for rips which is the zack of the same team but hes a guarante hes a center back guaranteed i got two 45m players to bring in for two defenders 45m im thinking of maseri just have man united cover dont you and maybe leis dunk is that too much having for bren and dunk no i dont think so this would be my team ill stick up on the screen in fact ill put in the discord team screenshots for you to see steo five 4 3 2 one you should be able to see it there chat you should be able to see me paste this in here that would be my team i think you cant see it there hang on just put it onto the screen sec talk amongst yourselves ladies and gentlemen talk amongst yourselves that would be my team there youd be having the man united defender in mazari why is that considering you just absolutely slammed man united youre going with a man united asset whats that all about i do like the look of him he had a cracking shot today the one through the legs i do like him i do think hes a very attackminded player much more attacking than waka how the will you be bringing in an arsenal you got havs havent you not concerned about sacka well cant have more can you chelsea yes but palmers too much money i could go do the whole jackson keep jackson and save my money there and spread it elsewhere in midfield but if i could free 15m having jackson instead of watkins but consideration but im not having salah or not having salah is it going to bite us all in the in the in the ass essentially well if you put salah in that team youre going to have to restructure everything because he comes in for lets just say jotter then you wont be able to have no i wont be able to have i wont be able to have havs no okay lets just lets build a harand salah team so it be jackson out havit out and itll be it be pedro in and it would be say wher my god everyones gone up in value steo i know theyve gone up in value thats why im making sure that i dont lose value my god how much have you lost in money 01 02 how do i one sec i one 1006 and i got 01 in the bank well thats your team value but you must have what players have you must have lost 01 on fernandez on e only on e on e right okay so you got rid of fernandez before he had a price drop correct thats good thats good so you pedro jackson harland and then i would go jo j out salah in which then i need to free up wow i can i can do this i can do this quite easily wow steo im im looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this give me a moment give me a momento fabianski ill put you back in best 45 goalkeeper chat fleen veran sells of nottingham forest fabian whats the news on arola anybody in chat news on arola best 45 chat when incredibly im looking at this v bruan and fleen double up okay and i prefer it to just having martinez and id rather than have a conza from villa instead well it would mean having taken out my god in fact i can even get rid of greaves if i stuck with this team and not worry about watkins because blazy makes a point here that watkins you cant justify his price currently i completely agree what jackson at 75 he a 75 is he arola hurt his back is that it is that all he did is jackson worth 75m again if youre happy to i dont have a problem with him is he a guaranteed starter i dont know i dont im not a chelsea aicio unfortunately but i must say that i do like the vuan and fleen double up i think thats i think thats the move for me in fact im even going to do that right now im going to do that right this second confirm transfers thats done and i do agree with chat theyre saying about lewis being dropped being dropped for the arsenal game it probably will happen but his value is just skyrocketing hes gonna be going up in price again sano is a good pick in he he stands out at his price point 55 is on penalties you say yes and kevin kelly making a point here its not a bad one kevin k instead of 25 two 45 goalkeepers would it not be better to have ry and 14m that equals the same 95 doesnt equal it doesnt equal nine unfortunately if it was a five goalkeeper brilliant unfortunately its not its a 55 im close to maybe working out something magical here steo well if you hit your no i havent hit it yet if i come if i find something magical here then i think its dont matter i think i have to lets quickly look defenders what defenders do i want in my team that are going to get me loads of points ric lewis for the price point i can see why youve done it i can hes cheap and hes playing hes got brenford next hes got brenford next a dread maker a point jotter next week could be the one getting the points and diaz blanking i dont think diaz is blanked at all this season i think diaz has returned in every single match so far and the answer is all right away i switch nothing three points but then hes got a four thats ridiculous a 14 and a 15 pointer was he visa a good option cheap 6m guaranteed to play for brenford absolutely nailed absolutely ned gravy dave said im gonna be going with pal torres well gravy dave is doing extremely well in the youtube chat league fire talk saying jason is stealing all of steves different r ma madai played 85 minutes today and he looked good did you watch the game did you well i just i heard i heard about it i didnt watch game saying best defense is surely trent robertson and poro and then work from that madai ladies and gentlemen what would you what do you say about madai blaze he certainly looks sharp i like i think okay this is this is looking op as hell this is looking scary this team that ive assembled the avengers essentially my god okay goalkeeper ryer in go would you rather have ryer in goal than becca than allison id have ray in goal but then again thats only because liverpool have burnt me so much ill probably have ray id rather take ryer personally isnt he 0 five more expensive or they i dont even know same the same are they w becks 56 do welbecks got two goals and assist so far y yep im fully aware right im im going to send you a screen im going to show you this team and this is quite scary okay on the discord team screenshots this is quite a scary team chat i want you honest opinions of this team because i think i may have found an op team that is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous can you see that on screen when you put it in discord ill be able to see it thats ridiculous absolutely ridiculous r fabian mazari my god d diaz medi salah i know right it looks like you cant afford it double brighton well no because you gone double brighton attack and haland yes but i but i was over that od to take whale back and go with a two a 352 formation rock a 352 the problem is that youre then going to be what you said against dont get wrong on paper im looking at thinking good lord thats ridiculous def brighten attack you have a laugh youre having a laugh well i can get yujo 45 and then just put the 12 into the rest the team somewhere like who i dont even know where i would upgrade so if i if i was to go yo as a as a third striker that i would never play could i could just move pedro out i got 68 then i the how much his havocs now 81 alexander saying wellbe has a trap over the seasons he has been a form slp purple patch player has a couple of good games and then disappears james making the point youve got too much squad depth rams 44 south hampton there pl of shots not at him thats a shame that team is how much was e again 69 69 now what were you going to say sorry ste on paper this team i look at i think how the hell have you come up with that hang on ive got an idea on paper that is a a quite a frightening team see is es going to go back up again is he im assuming hell be at some point over the international break will go back up to s million so i dont want to be getting him gone but that is im gonna im going to send you another team now which is im gonna send you another team which again is quite disgusting alex swe say no newcastle thats a good thing no spurs thats a good thing okay what about this is this a is this a more balanced team here we go people saying about rico le being a huge w its its the money game at the moment what about this team steo rico lewis is the money game so we got martinez in goal its my old team isnt it trent de dun le ma i got e though 352 e instead of seeno again ive got nothing against this whatsoever its it looks pretty powerful the only downside is that if one of your players doesnt play and ojo is your well no be a defender that comes no i know that but thats the problem but what if lewis doesnt play oo there are technically potential risks over pedro again these players are still gna come on and play ujo is definitely never gonna play in a million years but all the other players its again i look at it and go its is that excellent theres no arsenal which is no arsenal there is no arsenal but at the end of the day like youve just stated you cant have them more and youve got both howand and salah how much is rogers five fire talk saying what did you say yesterday about having a deep bench precisely matthew z is saying get rid of diaz and welbeck whats the situation on michael keane he played 90 minutes playing because braith weight is out i dont know how long braith weight is out for but hes playing hes playing for now but i have no idea how long braith weight is out for but he is right now playing whats the popular picks at 4m at the moment theres not is there for a defender maybe aston ville is nego jovic his name is but he again he didnt even start yesterday unfortunately hes played 11 minutes hardw bellis he has hardwood bellis is he playing every game he should be 55 if you look at his minutes he was brought off early the other day and then yesterday was brought off very early was jan bedner whos getting every game bner i should say hes getting every game scotland rester saying i want to see jason make a decision for himself without no outside influence good good point bednar is probably better ben is saying paulie and dan saying greaves player that ive got but that does your team again looks extraordinary with salah in it incredible theres no 44 strikers is there no and they never will be theyll never go down in price not enough people own them and 352 in this particular game so far with the amount of options in midfield that i think that there you could go into going to the end of this stream with that team that youve got in front of me with martin has fab ani etc and then you could just reevaluate in a weeks time i think i may have got another combination of players that could be genuinely could be good okay this is this is a again a different a different one i might think this is this is quite is there is there is there a five million ric lewis is its too good to ignore any lets be honest lets be honest right what do you think of this one steo ive just posted there with i think you made the team weaker what having havit in it havit and rogers over who was it and bermo and pedro ip switch net for brighton i think youve got to a point now where youre overthinking i think genuinely you go back to the one just above that leave it for a week and then we come back within burma in the one within burma and then i can upgrade bed to my god thats rari well m masari whatever his name is and then i could i can just reassess it i got point three in the bank and this is the point reassess in a week and thats exactly what im going to be doing point three in the bank and then what play what players are going up tonight theres a lot of players going up tonight is there and one of them is going to be in fact a lot of pedro harem well becks going up but remember if you bring if you menu is going up you want to be making sure that you the players that are going up youve gotten your team now in case you want them proper because if not youve just missed out on them youre not going to make any money on them in the sense of profit but at least youll smith row for me nah fulam useless i think in all honesty the only one is welbeck but i dont know like if i think if you got pedro you dont have welbeck as well this is sunday surgery fire talk its called ripping our teams to pieces because theyre that bad and redoing them mo saying hampton defense isnt very good look at the match against brenford they were just stupid mistakes absolut stupid mistakes henderson is not a bad chat at 45 is he lets be honest crystal palace hes not that bad not a bad show no fulam will finish above united this year they look great they dont theyre not that great theyre not that great theyre a good team they aint going to be finishing above pham me above man united not going to be happening not gonna be happening that jason i thought we wanted to get off here for an hour after an hour i do i need i need to go but im just im im mesmerized at this im mesmerized my god why would i want well backck in my team steo can you tell me tell you what sorry can you tell me why i would want welbeck in my team brightons got good fixtures theyre in a very attacking team and pedro hes one of the focal points but would i want both players in my team no again i say we reevaluate this but and there is a butt dont laugh steo dont laugh there is there is a butt if masera is going up okay and then i just have a 4 one defender who why did r face go is it is it r face why did he go up because he scored a goal thats the only reason he went up against aston villa that cost me clean sheets its fixed as are r awful is it even a good option i dont even know leicester would you own a leicester defender i think of the three teams theyre probably the better equipped to keep a clean sheet right last this is the last screenshot steo and this is purely for price rises in mind okay purely for price rises in mind and i can switch it out im going to im going to put the the team in and im thinking of it myself its not a bad team is it not a bad team mate is it sticking with henderson and then weve got this is insane team to be honest but its just pretty much identical to i personally prefer the one above what the one well backs price ris i prefer the one with the double so ray and goal and then the midfield and then whatnot i prefer that team whats the difference are you what no but no youd hang on youd rather have rogers instead ofo no theres so many bloody combinations here its going to take me forever to be able to work this out but the latest one youve got double bright attack and bumo medek as a sal again this is just based for price rises its benching headaches for you isnt it i love it i love this team cj team two weeks magical

5,fantasyfootballfixYT,dOewUlqqdAk,🤖 AI FPL BEST TEAM REVEAL &amp; Top Captain Picks | Fantasy Premier League 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 4 Guide,2024-09-13T09:33:25Z,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix YouTube channel and to another episode of Eddie versus the algorithm the series where myself fbl Phillips takes on the computer generated team put together by the fantasy football fix algorithm for every game we of the season in head-to-head fashion so far it's been a very interesting start to the campaign two wins for me in game week one and two but the algorithm came back with a bang last week scoring over 84 points I believe so it absolutely wiped the floor with me to be honest with the Harland captaincy and everything involved uh so yeah it's 2-1 now in the series as we move into gameweek 4 I'm very excited to see what team the algorithm has lined up and have put together my own best 11 to try and outscore it four points this game week if you are enjoying the series and have been following along make sure to drop a thumbs up on the video really just help us out here and yeah without any more messing around let's get into it shall we and have a look at the computers predicted points highest scoring team I messed that up you know what I mean the highest predicted Point scoring team for game week four let's have a look at [Music] it so as you can see updated score at the bottom of your screen 2-1 now to myself as we move into the fourth game we of the season it's 67 predicted points for the algorithm and to try and Achieve that it's put together this team in goal it's going to be Dean Henderson and I thought this was an interesting pick to go for given that Crystal Palace have not been a team renowned for for doing well defensively so far this campaign and to be honest I thought I'd use this kind of thing to stimulate maybe just taking you guys over to the actual fantasy football fix website and having a look at the process that I'd run through to actually analyze these picks and go and have a look for them myself and look at the data Etc so as you can see here we've got the op the stats tool from the fantasy football fix website that you can check out for yourself via the link below in the description so say I wanted to have a look at this and kind of see how Crystal Palace or Alin Henderson as an individ idual player has been performing I could do that with the toggle player tole stats toggle Team level at the top which I press there and then we can have a look at all the team data over the course of the season so far we can also go back and look at other Seasons so I can change it to 2023 if I want to there uh but if we go and have a look at you know the expected clean sheets so far this season I can look per 90 minutes uh and we can see Liverpool top at the bottom we've got teams like Everton West Ham ipswitch I hope it's not too small on your screen but we see Palace there coming in coming in Fifth and obviously expected clean sheets is sometimes used a bit sparingly uh expected goals conceded also lines up pretty well so You' still got Crystal Palace uh down in the sixth worst of the bunch and then I'd look to maybe find other Keepers who from other teams who've been performing well uh and find players teams with good fixtures as well for which I'd used the fixture analyzer which which I'm not going to bring out today but you can check out for yourself uh via the links Down Below in the description as well so Palace overall although Dean Henderson is is a cheap affordable goalkeeper they've not been performing that well and for that reason I probably wouldn't have him in this week even with the fixture against Leicester at home I don't think Leicester have looked uh awful by any stretch of the imagination and for that reason I don't think I'm going to go with him well I haven't gone with him uh and yeah Henderson is one that I think people who owned him at the start of the season are kind of getting a bit cold on and looking to shift out on a wild card whatever week that's coming up in so it's a nice fixure admittedly for Crystal Palace they could well keep a CLE she this game week but in terms of defenses in form uh I'm not really quite sure they're the one teams like brenford have had much tougher fixtures but still have a goalkeeper of 4.5 million with some better expected goal conceded data and you know okay games coming up I suppose but this week you're not going to go for fleen obviously uh in defense we've got Trent under Arnold Lewis dunk Rico Lewis and then Munos of Crystal Palace so double up on those Palace Defenders and again you know here's the point where you could look towards the op stats tool and have a look at the kind of 4.5 mil Defender bracket if you're on a wild you're going to want to look at some Defenders under 5 million and then filtering it just to Defenders I'll look per 90 minutes and then my favorite statistic on here the expected FPL points filtering it by that and often you really have to put a minimum minutes in or you're going to get players who who've been on the pitch for for just five minutes and might have nearly got one assist so we've got minkovich here we've got Rico Lewis then coming in second so I think that reinforces what you see with your right test that that he's a fantastic pick there are other options here you know you got Luca who is a troll and will never go near my FPL team again but you've got some good options in here and and I think it's just to display really what you're getting out of the fantasy football fix site uh we've had some great offers on recently so get over there check it out for yourself um definitely only like the one tool you need if anything to analyze stats and data uh and use it all you can see here with the stats on XG stuff like that you can filter it by so many things you've got so many different categories with with involvement uh you've got set pieces you've got all that stuff so yeah I don't think you need to hear more about me from that today I'm just going to go through and tell you what I think about each of these players based on what I've done with looking at the stats and using my own eye test in person so yeah uh the Trent obviously is a great pick Trent versus Robertson's been a bit of a debate this week you could go and compare those two for example over fantasy football fix uh which you'd find that the data is is pretty close Trent has that higher resist I think Robertson's had some uh more goal threats so it's quite close when you come to expected goal involvements overall but Trent is great for bonus he's obviously got that kind of setpiece threat we've only had three game weeks so far so sample sizes are still relatively small I think that if you can get the extra money I think Trent Robertson and Salo is probably your optimal Liverpool triple up right now if you can afford it though so Duncan Lewis two pretty good looking 4.5 mil Defenders not literally but in terms of FPL well nothing against the two of them I'm sure they're both fine looking chaps uh to whoever's interested in them uh dunk and Lewis then I think dunk in it for the fixtures really IP switch at home obviously a great one same with Man City brenford at home we've not got competitions to worry about as we're only picking for one game week so Lewis's minutes should be pretty good for this game week I still think he's worth it if you're on a wild card personally he'd be in my team there and he's going to be in my team this week Munos has been pretty attacking still this season but as I mentioned Crystal Palace haven't impressed much defensively however with the fixture against Leicester at home you do have to kind of back a team who did so well last season against the promoted side at home you know within the first four game weeks of the season when we don't really have too much else to go on and then in Midfield we've obviously got Muhammad Salah who comes in here but only taking the vice Captain's armband which is interesting we've then got L Diaz his teammate partnering him up alongside Arabi e so yeah completed Crystal Palace triple up which is pretty unsurprising given E's form I was very firm on holding him last week for people and lo and behold he came good even against Chelsea I was saying you know don't bench him uh po players like Rogers Etc I think a just has that Talisman uh talismanic nature about his play he's just clearly quality and he OES it on the pitch he should have had multiple returns in the game weeks where he blanked and yeah uh it was no surprise that he came good really and I think he could continue to do that again this game week Sal and L Diaz don't really need much to talk about there leis Diaz the only thing I'd be worried about is of course those early substitutions where we're seeing you know Darwin and gakpo coming on V and Diaz pretty much every game around the 7075 minute Mark uh but you do get some real explosivity with Diaz his data underlying stats look really really good especially per 90 but then of course you know you've got a little bit of that minutes worry uh for me though I think he is the second choice midfielder maybe now ahead of jot if you're on a Liverpool attacking double up and then finally up front we've got erling harand Alexander isach and daddy Welbeck so the team does kind of pick itself this game week with some teams that have looked pretty decent having good fixtures and then Crystal Palace uh so yeah you've got Harland in you've got Welbeck in isach and Newcastle have been underwhelming in my view I think a popular set of transfers this week is isak and sacka out to try and bring in Salah for those who don't have him with a cheaper forward maybe like a Xiao Pedro um so yeah I think you could easily hold on to isach for one more week I don't think wolves are an impressive side I think Newcastle are going to come good they they've done okay away from home they have scor goals at Bournemouth Etc so isach is a hold for me unless you've got the benefit of those free transfers or you're on a wild card pretty much and it's encouraging to see him in the fantasy football fix algorithms predicted highest point scoring team for gameweek four as an owner myself Danny wilck against jaia Pedro is an interesting one I think it's been pretty neck and neck you've just got age going against Welbeck youve got minutes going against Welbeck uh you've got the fact that jaia Pedro has moved to that forward position when welbeck's gone off the pitch going against Welbeck and you've also got p penties going against him so for me there is just enough to swing me H in the other direction currently and then finally on the bench you've got the blugan you've got I don't even know that is Rogers and wings so yeah uh we'll move into having a look at my team now how it compares to this one and then you guys can leave Below in the comments if you kindly would which team you think is going to score more points for game week [Music] four so yeah sorry if this video has felt a bit jumbl today we're trying something new with the statistics I'm aware that uh maybe not everyone wants to see that but if you want you can go check out for yourself as mentioned with the links below but this is my team for this game week I've gone with martinez a villa in goal Everton at home I think it's a decent fixture although everon have scored goals I've considered going calber lein I think he's a good option uh to go for maybe if you want like a differential on a wild card this week or a differential forward pick I actually quite like the look of Cal luren and I think Everton could get something there but I do back Martinez as a keeper option had the extra bit a 0.5 million over the 4.5s so he's the one I've gone for I've then gone for that optimal Liverpool triple up that I mentioned that I think is probably the best one that I'd have on a wild card this week so Robertson Trent and mo Salah I then got Rico Lewis in there still as well as eay and then a Brighton triple up on the attack so M matoma and xia Pedro uh so I really think that Brighton could do something good against ipswitch this week I think it might be quite an open and attacking game I think Ipswich will'll probably go for it we've seen them be quite Brave already in the Premier League so far um so yeah high scoring hopefully in that one for me and then finally I've gone with Nicholas Jackson with Chelsea up against Bournemouth he's been in pretty decent form and where you're struggling to find certainty around minutes in the Midfield options I think Jackson offers a pretty nice kind of budget alternative so yeah that's my team let me know Down Below in the comments which you think is going to score more points as we'll have a quick discussion about the captaincy now and whether or not for those seller and Harland the right one to put the armband is clear and [Music] obvious so yeah as I mentioned I think there's only really two standout Captain options this week if you don't own Salah or Harlem what are you doing but they're both predicted eight points for this game week on the dot by the fantasy football fix algorithm so Harlem will have been very very slightly ahead in terms of decimal points uh but yeah the fixtures obviously two very strong home games for the pair of them brenford for Harland Nan forest for Salah I personally this week would just about go for Harland but I'll explain why I think Salah is as close to if if not a better option I think you back Harland he's scored two hat tricks in a row could make it three he's looked fantastic this season I think if you've watched Harlan play for a decent number of minutes you'll see he looks different than last season he looks better in my view than last season he looks leaner he looks more hungry I'd argue maybe as well but on the other hand you've got Salah gets that extra point for the clean sheet the extra point for a goal when he gets it he's also got a great record on Saturday and also a great record at home you know against Nottingham Forest so there's a lot to go for both of them it's really really another kind of 50/50 gut feeling it test then plus who you own pretty much so as's not much else I'm going to add I think to this debate uh in terms of captaincy this week is very very hard to pick uh you guys just make the call for yourselves I'm sorry to be so useless in this regard but yeah that's going to wrap up today's video I hope you guys have enjoyed it as I mentioned before if you do leave a thumbs up that would be hugely appreciated drop the comment as well and yeah if you're new around here feel free to subscribe and other than that I'll see you in the next video may your arrows be green I'll catch you later goodbye [Music],2831,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football

6,fantasyfootballfixYT,OyxDarrEgJ8,🔒 FPL GW4 WILDCARD ESSENTIALS | TOP Fantasy Premier League transfers 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 4 Guide,2024-09-12T09:45:01Z,yes guys welcome back to another fanasy football fix YouTube video my name is FPL nacho and in today's video we are looking at the top transfers going into game week 4 I want to look at those Liverpool midfielders some forwards and importantly some wild card Essentials if you have activated that chip so as always if you look forward today's video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button right further Ado let's get into today's video [Music] so first up I think we really need to talk about these Liverpool midfielders going into gameweek four quite a lot of managers out there are probably sat there with one two or maybe even three Liverpool if you did start the season with your bullish thoughts on Liverpool but in general I think most managers are sat there with maybe a Defender and a midfielder myself I currently have Trent and Dogo jota so coming into game week four this was always penciled in as a bit of a fixture swing for Liverpool assets with not and Forest at home Bournemouth at home Wolves Away who have actually started the season pretty poorly and then Crystal Palace away so the next four fixtures for Liverpool are great now before we actually go into the players we need to mention that of course the champions league is returning Liverpool will be playing away against AC Milan between n of forest and bulou so we need to take that into consideration when we are looking at any player from a Champions League team and I do think Diaz and most Salah will have their minutes managed at some point over the next four game weeks so I think rotation is going to happen regardless gak poking play instead of Diaz kza could play on the right hand side instead of mosala these things will happen at some point it's an inevitability so we need to understand which player to go for now if you're on a wild card first and foremost let's get that out of the way I think because you are starting basically from scratch mosala is the player that you go for I just don't see a world where you look at these fixures coming up you look at Moos Salah and importantly be in a captaincy option in gameweek five and not put him in your team so first and foremost you cannot go without Moos Salah if you are going on the wild card in my eyes you go for mosalah and then it's a question of do you go for Salah and Diaz or do you just go for mosala now if you're in a position right now similar to myself or you own a bico Saka and you're looking to bring in a Liverpool midfielder you can go one or two ways you could do the easy downgrade option to a Lis Diaz which won't require points hits but for some managers out there I do think that Saka de Salah will actually incur a points hit so looking at the underlying numbers of both players Lu Diaz actually has the higher expected goals at 2.34 compared to MOS sala's 1.88 but consistent with what we saw last season mosala continues to be a chance creator for this Liverpool team at 1.48 expected assist to Lis Diaz's 1.09 but the shot volume is still in most salah's favor but only just and again we're only looking at three game weeks worth of information here so we haven't really got enough data to come to clear conclusions right now but in terms the underline numbers mainly mosalah is leading the way but I do think Luis Diaz is putting up great numbers considering he is 5 million cheaper than that of mosala so if I was to buy one right now if you have an easy route to mosala I do think it is the best option for your fpr teams I think as I mentioned it gives you a captaincy option in game week five where Man City play against Arsenal and naturally people have been go for how and captaincy mosala is a brilliant Captain pick for the Bournemouth game at home now if you haven't made a transfer already please do hold off for the Friday press conferences both players have been away on International Duty and I do think Arnie slot will give us something in the press conference to give us a bit of a fitness update on all players in the scad cuz all it takes is him to come out and say Diaz travel back of a knock and all of a sudden it makes the decision very very clear so in terms of buying a player this week outside of the wild card as I mentioned if you can get to mosala easily I do think that is the way to go however if you're in a position where you don't have an easy route to mosala I personally think Lis Diaz is more than capable of matching mosala over this period the underlying numbers are fantastic I think is minutes yes what they could be rotational are still going to be starting minutes for us to have enough confidence to go for a Lis Diaz so if you can afford mosala I think you go there he is going to be long-term the better pick but if you can't go there I wouldn't stress about it too much I still think Luis Diaz is a fantastic pick for your team and the form that he's in right now I don't see him coming out of this Premier League team anytime soon consistently so for that reason if you can't get there Luis Diaz is an amazing option for your teams still so next I want to take a look at some of the forwards available in the game because if you're moving away from a bakar Saka you might need to free up some funds and we need to understand who the best player to go to is so the reason why I brought up isak Jay Pedro and oie Watkins is because a lot of managers right now are actually selling Alexander isach to fund the moala move and we need to discuss whether that is actually the right move for your FPL teams because I think we're getting into a classic situation here where we are getting tempted by the shiny object in mosala which is absolutely understandable but I think we're forgetting what a Brant option Alexander isach truly is now at 8.5 million we knew going into the season that he was going to be an elite finisher penalty Taker and guaranteed minutes with the injury to K Wilson no European football for Alexander isach it looked like a no-brainer for our FPL teams and one goal one assist and a reminder in game week one they were down to 10 men for 60 minutes I actually think it's been a quite a favorable start for Alexander ISAT but clearly managers have seen enough and are selling him in their thousands now 0.85 XG per 90 0.8 sorry during the course of the three games 0.6 to expected assists decent underlying numbers and his shot volume is much better than that of xia Pedros and Ole Watkins now the player that a lot of managers are moving towards is going to be xia Pedro the most bought player going into gameweek four and when we look at the fixtures coming up I absolutely understand it if switch at home Nos and Forest at home in the next two are great entry points if you're looking to bring in a Brighton asset and with Xiao Pedro yes he did travel with the international team and he did play 45 minutes in the most recent Brazilian game I don't think Xiao Pedro is going to be a risk going into this week in terms of the international uh competition I do think however that they do have attacking options which could be a rotation risk for him so while I don't think he's fatigued I think Brighton naturally have Replacements that can step in for him over the next four game weeks I look at people like rut who was one of their most expensive signings ever Evan Ferguson back with the Brighton team and ciso playing in at number 10 while I do think xia Pedro is going to be rotational all of a sudden I do think that that could happen at times over the next few weeks now of course they don't have European football so they need to find minutes for these players in the Premier League and while I think X Pedro is a brilliant option if you do want to downgrade from Alexander isach it would be my number one pick I think selling Alexander isach is a bit of a knee-jerk move right now for a lot of managers Wolves Away followed by Fulham away man city at home not ideal in game week six but I'm I'm also aware that a lot of managers are wild carding in game week six so you don't really need to worry about him after that point so for me just to conclude those two players if you're doing isach down to Xiao Pedro as a free transfer and then upgrading saaka de Salah then yes I can get behind it but again wait until the Friday press conferences for an update on x F Fitness and fatigue but in terms of managers going from ole Watkins I think this is a move that I can get behind Watkins hasn't been pitching in training in the last 24 hours and we know he has been carrying a slight niggle and coming into this weekend great fixture at home against Everton followed by Wolves at home however we have the Champions League that we need to take into account with Aston Villa coming between game weeks four and five and I do think if you're in a position right now of oie Watkins it is a case of you don't sell unless we get confirmation that he is actually injured but you also don't buy him it's a very simple situation with Ole Watkins so to conclude with the forwards I think Alexander isach is a keep unless you are looking to downgrade him to isach to then afford a moala and even then I would urge you to just consider it because I think isach is going to be one of those players that will continue to tick over nicely as a forward and I do think he can easily get returns in gameweek four but let me know your thoughts in the comments have you already sold these players going into the weekend so next up I wanted to take a look at some gameweek four Wild Card Essentials that I would go for going into this weekend now it's worth noting there are lots of players to choose from and lots of different strategies that we can go for but I thought there were a couple of players that I think are just easy locks for our team if we to do so so we've really touched on mosala I think if you're wild card in in gameweek four it's almost impossible to go without him I think jot I think Diaz POS rotation risk with GPO and Darwin Nunes I think moales spot even though he is Aging in comparison to the other players is still going to be pretty locked in in this Liverpool team so if you're wild Carden right now I wouldn't overthink it I would go for mosala and spoiler aler I would also go for for erling hland I think that's a player that I would find it very very difficult to go without so I personally would go for the premium option of Mo Salah and erlin Highland now in terms of the rest of the options again with the Liverpool pict is coming up very hard to look past Trent Alexander Arnold I do think Robertson is given us Great Value 1 million cheaper but I think if you're wild carding right now Trent is just one of those players that has that magic touch in the game I'm going to be honest and I think if someone is going to get a double digit return over the next few weeks it is going to be Trent Alexander Arnold now I get it Connor Bradley is taking some minutes and we can be cautious of that but I still think if you're wild card in right now Trent is a player that you do need in your teams now it CH us a budget enablers that we can go towards I really do like e I've seen a lot of managers going for in buo which I do get behind but what I like about e is it gives you that price point that if you don't want to have him buo for the next couple of weeks with tricky games you can go to E with that brilliant home game against Leicester and then if you don't think he is a long-term pick for your teams you can easily use him as a bit of a cash cow to then go to Brian and buo in game week six when then fixtures start to swing but for game week four at home against Leicester I think it's very difficult to look past e and also xia Pedro we spoke about him I don't think he's necessarily A desperate transfer for people's teams however if I was wild carding this week I think he's offering too much value right now at his price point to ignore so I do think if I was buying fresh on a wild card he would be in that team but as you can see I think there are really great players out there that you can go for so there's only a few players I would deem quote unquote essential and even then I think there are some great options like a calt Leen if you want to go for an Everton forward long term I think there have some great cheap enablers in Morgan Rogers and seeno again long-term picks for your side so I don't think there is a clear wild card for team but I do think if I was building it I would make these players the core of it and then sprinkle other players around it let me know your thoughts in the comments the big thing for warart 4 is how you going to get to Arsenal players in game week six so last upep I thought would be really important here to take a look at the pred predicted points for gameweek four to get an understanding of which players this week are great to own and maybe also some captaincy picks so top of the table is going to be mo Salah with eight predicted points and kind of back in the narrative that if you are going to go for a Liverpool midfielder and you can afford him he is the route to go for and we know in gameweek five he is going to be clearly the standout option so if he's looking good on the algorithm in gameweek four then I think for the next two game weeks he is one of the best picks in the game full stop erling hland 7.6 great underlying numbers we know that he can bag a hat-trick in any fixture and if you don't have mosala this is an easy captaincy pick for your teams e as well really really great underlying numbers even though the FPL points haven't been there prior to gameweek three 6.5 I think he's a great differential Captain but can anyone really be brave enough to go there outside of Salah and Highland I probably doubt it so I think a is just a great player to own in general in your teams and de bruy looking actually great 5.8 predicted points not a player that I think a lot of managers are going towards unless they're wild card in and I do think with someone like a de bruy it's a very difficult player to buy especially when you have other options at cheaper prices available but if you want to go differential for a onewe punt I do not mind Kevin De bruy at all rest of the players Diaz and jotter at 5.4 and 5.3 again if I had to pick one it probably would just be Lis Diaz I think I think his numbers are slightly better than that of dieas and I think his minutes might be a little bit better and then finishing up the table we have Trent Watkins sacka and Kai havit I wouldn't be looking to buy Arsenal assets now but Arsenal are very interesting topic where injuries to odard and suspension to Rice mean going into game week four a lot of managers are not really bullish on Arsenal and are selling someone like a bakar saaka but I think Saka if you can keep him might actually bit of a shrewd hold going into the weekend against a Spurs team that always give you chances but let me know in the comment section who is your captain going to be for game week four and that's going to wrap up today's video really hope that's provided some value we've deep di into the top transfers and the Wild Card Essentials but if you have any questions please do put them in the comment section we'll be sure to get them as soon as possible have an amazing day make sure you drop a like and smash the Subscribe button and I'll see you real soon take care cheers oh,3025,yes guys welcome back to another fanasy football fix youtube video my name is fpl nacho and in todays video we are looking at the top transfers going into game week 4 i want to look at those liverpool midfielders some forwards and importantly some wild card essentials if you have activated that chip so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button right further ado lets get into todays video so first up i think we need to talk about these liverpool midfielders going into gw four quite a lot of managers out there are probably sat there with one two or maybe even three liverpool if you did start the season with your bullish thoughts on liverpool but in general i think most managers are sat there with maybe a defender and a midfielder myself i currently have trent and dogo jota so coming into game week four this was always penciled in as a bit of a fixture swing for liverpool assets with not and forest at home bournemouth at home wolves away who have started the season pretty poorly and then crystal palace away so the next four fixtures for liverpool are great now before we go into the players we need to mention that of course the champions league is returning liverpool will be playing away against ac milan between n of forest and bulou so we need to take that into consideration when we are looking at any player from a champions league team and i do think diaz and most salah will have their minutes managed at some point over the next four game weeks so i think rotation is going to happen regardless gak poking play instead of diaz kza could play on the right hand side instead of mosala these things will happen at some point its an inevitability so we need to understand which player to go for now if youre on a wild card first and foremost lets get that out of the way i think because you are starting from scratch mosala is the player that you go for i just dont see a world where you look at these fixures coming up you look at moos salah and importantly be in a captaincy option in gw five and not put him in your team so first and foremost you cannot go without moos salah if you are going on the wild card in my eyes you go for mosalah and then its a question of do you go for salah and diaz or do you just go for mosala now if youre in a position right now similar to myself or you own a bico saka and youre looking to bring in a liverpool midfielder you can go one or two ways you could do the easy downgrade option to a lis diaz which wont require points hits but for some managers out there i do think that saka de salah will incur a points hit so looking at the underlying numbers of both players lu diaz has the higher expected goals at 234 compared to mos salas 188 but consistent with what we saw last season mosala continues to be a chance creator for this liverpool team at 148 expected assist to lis diazs 109 but the shot volume is still in most salahs favor but only just and again were only looking at three game weeks worth of information here so we havent got enough data to come to clear conclusions right now but in terms the underline numbers mainly mosalah is leading the way but i do think luis diaz is putting up great numbers considering he is 5m cheaper than that of mosala so if i was to buy one right now if you have an easy route to mosala i do think it is the best option for your fpr teams i think as i mentioned it gives you a captaincy option in game week five where man city play against arsenal and naturally people have been go for how and captaincy mosala is a brilliant captain pick for the bournemouth game at home now if you havent made a transfer already please do hold off for the friday press conferences both players have been away on international duty and i do think arnie slot will give us something in the press conference to give us a bit of a fitness update on all players in the scad cuz all it takes is him to come out and say diaz travel back of a knock and all of a sudden it makes the decision very clear

still going to be starting minutes for us to have enough confidence to go for a lis diaz so if you can afford mosala i think you go there he is going to be longterm the better pick but if you cant go there i wouldnt stress about it too much i still think luis diaz is a fantastic pick for your team and the form that hes in right now i dont see him coming out of this premier league team anytime soon consistently so for that reason if you cant get there luis diaz is an amazing option for your teams still so next i want to take a look at some of the forwards available in the game because if youre moving away from a bakar saka you might need to free up some funds and we need to understand who the best player to go to is so the reason why i brought up isak jay pedro and oie watkins is because a

the liverpool pict is coming up very hard to look past trent alexander arnold i do think robertson is given us great value 1m cheaper but i think if youre wild carding right now trent is just one of

even though the fpl points havent been there prior to gw three 65 i think hes a great differential captain but can anyone be brave enough to go there outside of salah and highland i probably doubt it so i think a is just a great player to own in general in your teams and de bruy looking great 58 predicted points not a player that i think a lot of managers are going towards unless theyre wild card

fantasy footballfix.com YouTube channel with me Tom C you can find me on X utterly TC and guys we are getting our way through this tedious International break we're all but finished now so consequently we're back with another Elite 11 team reveal and I'm super excited to say that I've got Andrew Neeve on this week I'm always pleased to talk to Andrew but this week especially as he is on his wild card so am I I'm sure lots of you watching are as well and we're going to talk through all of the Wild Card strategies guys so without further Ado let's get right into it Andrew mate welcome back to the channel my friend and of course we've got wild card chat to come going to ask you to pause the Wild Card chat for now and just briefly sum up how's the start of the Season been mate no no problem at all it's been a bit of a mixed bag I think game one wasn't great at all gameing 2 went really well nice big Green Arrow and game three again just a bit yeah um and that was just single-handedly came down to that Liverpool game at the end of uh last game week so it's been okay um I think if you said to me at the beginning of the season after gameing three if he just outside that top million I probably would have said okay I mean I'll take that uh last season it took me about 16 or 17 game weeks to get to where I am now so certainly not going to complain um yeah we'll obviously have a look at how things went in the last particular game week but it did literally just come down to that um lack of of Liverpool coverage and just only having one Liverpool player in the side I see yeah and we will look back at game week three Andrew of course like you mentioned like we were talking off camera beforehand that it's pretty far in the rearview mirror but we will take a look at at at the team that you have left behind you now um in a couple of minutes I've got to ask you though so behind the scenes little spoiler guys we were actually attempting to record this video last week but the tech Gremlins I'm afraid put paid to that but it's actually worked out well because you weren't on wild card at that particular Point Andrew you pressed the button subsequent to that so I've got to ask you what prompted that mate was it something that was in the offing all the time and it was actually you know borderline at that time or was this more of a um you know a strategic decision that you were always likely to make around game weeks three and four very borderline to be honest with it was it was a 50/50 call and I think it was it It ultimately came down to the injury to Bailey for me that sort of probably tipped it the other way and the fact that I had to make transfers going into the next game week to to put a decent enough side out on game week four and I hadn't pulled the trigger at the end of um Sunday evening I think it might have been perhaps the Monday or the Tuesday afterwards um and it it was after thinking about it a whole lot more and we'll obviously chat about it and we do go through the wild card but there's a definite shift in how I've I've had to think about how the wild card has played this season compared to last just simply because of those rule changes so it's just having that extra nights or two to think about it and then go well hold on maybe it does make sense for me to try and attack things a little bit more that's what ultimately led me to go okay well let's let's go for it I see makes sense mate and in terms of the first three game weeks had you got to the position of not needing to use any free transfers prior to pressing the wild card and are you've going to have you've retained those through the wild card is that the situation you're in I've made one transfer and that was for quaner yeah I started the season with him in gaming one and I think it's again it's it was such a fine sort of line between going wild card and not going wild card I think if if if sequan had still been continuing in the side and it started for Liverpool for those three games pretty sure I wouldn't have wild carded but the fact that I had to get rid of him in game week one sitting with bco on my bench I had an injury to Bailey last uh game week that's what ultimately led me to go well let's think about this wild card a little bit more seriously yeah I see mate well let's let's Look Backwards before we look forward and take a look how the points played out in gameweek three okay so I'm sure you'll be happy to say you know this is no longer the team but it's not a disaster to me Andrew like I'm sure that this is going to be a team that resembles a lot of the folks watching here as well so you know it's a while ago since you you um acred those points but I got to ask you in terms of the the team that you put put this together would you still be comfortable if you were in a position whereby you hadn't pressed the Wild Card you decided to retain this squad for whatever reason um Andrew putting aside the Bailey injury do you still think that the core of this team is a solid enough base for an FPL manager to to have worked with yeah absolutely which is why I say it was it was such a a close call with guys are going with the wild card or not I had two free transfers I saved my transfer in game week three so I could have done a you know inac down to Shao Pedro for example and upgraded Bailey and used those two free transfers but um yeah there were obviously a few players at the risk of losing value and there was an obvious lack of of certain Liverpool players in there too and not having a Liverpool defensive player there uh that I wanted to ultimately jump on and couldn't really get there comfortably with just those two free transfers and I didn't ultimately want to to end up wasting those transfers in a way for players that I expected I would have gotten on a wild card in the next couple of game weeks I always had the plan of wild carding early this particular season it was always going to be between four and six I'll be completely honest with you going into that last game week on last week's Sunday game week three I even then thought well don't really need to wild card and ultimately I didn't need to Wild Card this it's a decent enough side and I think there's a lot of players there that can obviously hurt me jumping off of them onto different players that I've got in on my wild card but um you know that's ultimately the risk you take and that can happen in any game week regardless of whether you're playing your wild card or not in regardless of how early in the season it might be absolutely yeah I couldn't couldn't agree more when I looked at this beforehand I just s thought it is a a strong Squad but you've articulated it it well I'm going to move us on Andrew because I'm sure the people watching are as fascinated as they will have been about the the introductory um summation that we've given them they want to see this wild card Squad and they want to hear your thoughts as to some of the decisions that you've made and which 50/50s I'm sure are still in the offing so let's move us on guys and take a little look at this gameweek four Wild Card Squad that Andrew's put together but I'm not going to do it straight away look at those grade out pictures there we've decided to tease you a little bit guys and you would have seen there are time stamps on the video now is probably an opportune time to say of course that you can head over to Fantasy footballfix.com if you haven't already done so and follow the thoughts of our Elite managers and of course Andrew is in that cohort of players and you can follow his Wild Card thoughts before game week four get started so Andrew let's go through this piece by piece then let's start with the goalkeeper here and I'm going to reveal him now so Ry was previously the goalkeeper prior to the wild card was there anybody else in the offing here in terms of um someone who might rival that spot or are you pretty happy with him as being the best route into the Arsenal defense to be honest I was probably one of the easiest decisions I I'd made on the wild card I started the season with Rea and with fabianski and goal and haven't changed them on my Wild Card more than happy with both of them obviously the fabianski core was the reason I sort of went with him besides any the other four Mill options was just simply because he he seemed like the one of those Keepers who could at some stage make his way into the first team now I I I don't know whether he's going to continue doing so obviously with um with the injury to arola on on the weekend it sounds like he's fine so but I'm you know I'm not relying on him in any way whatsoever Ray will be playing every game we for me I'm just not excited at all by the 4.5 options uh all the five M options to be perfectly honest so um he was always someone that was just a a simple simple easy one for me to stick in and and and probably not all that likely to treble up on West Ham options so you're not going to be blocking your root to any West Ham players by having fabianski in goal he says as a West Ham fan smiling so yeah I get it all right let's move on and take a look at the back three that you've selected mate so we've got some budget options here right across the board and we'll come come on and talk about the bench in a moment here but rur obviously the the player that's been attracting a lot of attention in the Man City backline get your thoughts on on him and whether or not you believe him to be a secure selection coner that's not the person you mentioned earlier of course from from Villa you talking about the Liverpool defender in game one and canate who's found his way into the the team here as well so talk me through these these options Andrew and what looks like a pretty budget backat line is that strategically different from how you were expecting to to to work things out yeah absolutely and I I will cave at that just by saying that that Kate option there is is is open uh to move um there's a few there's probably about three spots in my wild card that are that could change uh funny enough it's it's a forward and midfielder and a Defender and konato is one of them there is the option of downgrading one of my midfielders to to upgrade Kate to either a Robertson or a um Trent Alexander Arnold but regardless of what I do in that position it's going to be a Liverpool Defender I think defensively they've looked fantastic this season and obviously those next um two in particular are amazing for them going game week seven with Wolves too so I think I need that defensive coverage so Kate is in there just simply as as coverage I don't really you know it's it's not the most exciting thing to do obviously when you've got attacking uh fullbacks in that Liverpool team that you should rarely be getting in if you've got the funds to do so but um he was someone that I just thought you know if I stick him in there at least I'm covering those clean sheets with those guys if they don't get attacking returns then you know I've come out trumps yeah I get it on the canate speaking as an ex owner of him in previous Seasons the thing that's irritated me me with him is discipline and um yeah the yellow card sort of seem to follow him around and that can be ever so frustrating but I get it is a cheap route into what looks like a great route for clean sheets and guys we will take a look at some statistics in a few moments time as well and you'll you'll see straight away there the Liverpool defense is is definitely um sticking out positively let's talk around Man City defense then we a believer in Lewis or is this a hope pick Andrew or is it a little bit of both it's a hope pick it's an upside Chase and it's you know it's one of those players in there that um I like when I when I choose teams each week I like having those one or two players that are just at you know someone that you can hope comes right for you a little bit of a a risky pick and with ly's 100% it's a risky P I absolutely realize that um but one that can really come right for me uh if it doesn't really work out then I don't need him in game weeks five and six and can then look to get rid of him with three three threee transfers yeah in game week uh six so absolutely a risky pick I realized that and another reason why those other players that I have in there that I'm considering moving on or perhaps not actually starting within this wild card it's just simply because i' want to you know mitigate that risk and Lewis is definitely a risk yeah I understand it feels like a risk worth taking particularly on on wild card I guess at that at that price under 5 million to get into the potentially get into the Man City defense and I like the Robinson selection there on on the bench as well Andrew should it it go south I mean they've got decent fixtures still haven't they and and he's impressed hasn't he in the opening um few game weeks Anthony Robertson at fullback as a as a kind of fourth option substitute absolutely um he was my transfering in game we two for um for cona who obviously didn't end up continuing um in the Liverpool backline so quite happy that I've got him he's obviously come right in game week two and three I think it is with the assists so quite happy to have them and as a 4.5 mil option there's not that many other exciting on in there like I don't hold out too much hope for the Fulham backline to be honest with you I'm kind of going cold on Fulham somewhat but uh regardless of that he obviously has that attacking threat and for 4.5 million he's proba a little bit more I'm sure he's one of those that have gone up since quite happy for him to stay there yeah low risk play coner you've picked up from from Aston Villa here um Andrew know that their fixtures are are improving after they after a tough start um in terms of that Villa Collective do you think there's any kind of risk here with the with the Champions League starting up and being a bit of an unknown quantity we know how much Emory values European competition and why wouldn't he than the Champions League level do you think this is this is likely to see an impact on their FPL minutes as a collective or are we pretty confident that their strong season last season's going to be replicated yeah look I don't think any of us expect Villa to do as well this season as they as they did last season it's obviously going to be a lot tougher for them with that European football but um coner was he was just probably my pick of the 4.5 million options at the beginning of season I started with him game week one and and given the fixtures that Aston Villa have from game week three onwards for at least the next four or five game weeks um I think he's going to be an ever presentes and um okay again it's I I'm not expecting the world from asille defensively but if you compare them to any of the other 4.5 million options that we have I think they're probably one of the best bets okay interesting let's move on talked enough around the defense people want to see well this money being saved how's it been being spent so let's take a look at this Midfield and you can see there's there's a fair amount of chunk of change being invested here and we can also talk around and bumo as well sitting there on on the bench Andrew you've gone for this double Liverpool attacking um compliment here in Midfield of Lou Diaz and mosalah let's start there do you think this is the the best um contingent of Liverpool options the canate Louis Diaz and Salah um in terms of then what that allowed you to do elsewhere in the squad uh perhaps what allows you to do elsewhere I suppose yes I mean you could obviously your best option in defense is going to be train alexand rold and it's actually uh mentioning earlier the the options that I might think about uh downgrading somewhat to to allow for the upgrade of Kate to trend is uh Lis Diaz and he could go down to a midfielder for me I I like the look of of M at 5.5 obviously um he only played I think about 47 minutes in that first game week had to come up with with that concussion precaution but he's looked very very good out otherwise um so I quite like to look at him at 5.5 and that obviously frees up that two million to go canate to Trent alexand Arnold um it just means that I then need to probably move on in game week six because I'm not so uh excited about those bright and fixtures from game week six so that's one of the options for me I mean obviously if you can afford Trent and seller in the side that's going to be optimal um this year is obviously also another a bit of a worry playing for Colombia midweek this week um we've got to have a look at what is his uh minutes were like and and I'm going to wait until Friday probably Saturday morning to to see if we hear on whether he is going to start or not but if there is any Whispers or if I start getting cold feet on him uh and whether he is going to start or not then that's one of the moves I'm looking at lining up and and switching things out it means having one less Liverpool player and I I go into game week four with my wild card with just two Liverpool players as opposed to three um but another option for me is is going USDA M uh canate to Roberts or actually yeah I could actually yeah I could actually look at the the option of um keeping him there and then going Lewis to canata or Lewis to um uh Robertson alexand rold keeping canata there and downgrading a third player who I'll go through and we we talk about our forward options there so the Liverpool players are up for up for grabs at the moment for me haven't quite settled on exactly who I'm going to have there I would like to have three going into the next two game weeks just simply because of how good they are um it could be that I double up on the defense and and maybe mitigate the um the risk I have with Lewis and and getting rid of him for another Liverpool backline player so many so many permutations aren't they there Andrew and I think I just wanted to get your thoughts on that actually that in Years Gone by the you know Prospect of having Robertson and Alexander Arnold as a double up was fairly normal right to to talk around that I've not seen it for some considerable time has that entered your thoughts at all when you've been considering your wild card computations of actually possibly even investing six million and and sort of seven million in Robertson and Trent Alexander Arnold praying for the clean sheets and looking at them as as their attacking output as as well cuz it's certainly something that I'm looking at on Wild Card completely different con uh construct to what you're looking at is it something on your mind too yeah absolutely I've never been one that's liked spending too much in defense I think Trent Alexander Arnold needs to be the exception to that I don't think I'd be going both Trent and Robertson and myself just purely because of the money involved there but you know that's just a a personal option I'd rather take that extra Mill and go Trenton canate and spend that extra m in uh in attack that's just the way I've always sort of played I've prefer to you know move that money further up the pitch yeah makes sense to me all right cool and just before we take a look at the forwards guys I do want to ask you around Ando there obviously super tough fixture coming back in in gameweek four away at um Man City but he's as close to being fixture proof anyway at that sort of upper mid price in Midfield I guess anyway with his talismanic status um all but confirmed with ianony longer no longer being part of brentford's operations right so I mean in terms ofuma if you had to no real quams in playing him in in game week four anyway if if people already own him it's it's just the fact that you're on wild card and you've got a team that can allow you to that luxury I guess right yeah absolutely look if you can um afford to to bench a player like U because he's playing away at Man City then you obviously a great luxury to have but if you you know were forced into playing him if you perhaps didn't have someone on the bench that could come on to to replace him for that particular game week I don't think there's anything wrong with playing in bu Moto City city haven't exactly looked um fantastic defensively and if if hi switch can get it them then then um then brenford can certainly what I've tried to do with this particular team is is try and set myself up obviously with the Wild Card you're trying to set yourself up for as long term as possible um that changes slightly with the rule changes and something I can I can chat over in a little bit once we've got through all of um all of my options uh on in the front line there too but what I've tried to do is is set this team up in a way that um I have either got those players that I expect the gameweek six wild card is to have or it's easy enough for me to to get them in and bran is just a classic example of that I think come game week six he's going to be very highly owned just simply because of that fantastic run of fixtures that um that brenford have from game week six and he's one of those players that um you're more than happy coming off the bench if anything does happen to any one of your starters absolutely good thoughts mate all right well we've teased it long enough let's take a look at the front line okay so you kind of mentioned the bright um fixtures you you like initially um so Xiao Pedro finds his way in he's obviously we've got Captain erling harand probably don't need to talk around him too much there Andrew and Kai HT makes his way into the team as well I think he has 8.1 million at the time of uh recording so talk to me around this this um Trio Andrew and how you've arrived at this selection of forwards yeah I think I think harand and J Pedro kind of speak for them so Pedro um is a little bit of a worry obviously getting that call up to Res I think we're recording this on Tuesday night so unsure of his minutes at the moment but I I don't think he gets that many minutes internationally and I I'd be optimistic that he starts on the weekend against hip switch so I'm going to hang on to him um I think he's as good an option as you can get in that particular price bracket uh and he's a fantastic option for the next few games game weeks yeah he is shortterm for me I think Brighton as a whole are shortterm for me I think those fixtures from gameweek six just get particularly bad for them so I do have a plan to to either bench shiao Pedro in game week six and play those existing four midfielders that I have and buo obvious he comes in for jeia Pedro uh or I can get rid of him game week six just depending on you know what information we get between now and then um habits is the other player that mentioned earlier that is is up for grabs um there's obviously the news the OD guard injury during the week I I'll be honest with you I haven't really had enough time to give enough thoughts as to how that might affect him I haven't read up on whether Jes Zeus looks like he's going to be fit enough to play obviously if he is then that's you know a big minus in in in havit his box there because he's likely to be dropped back a lot further but um I'm not just going to Simply assume that that's going to be the case just because of that injury I I want to give it a few days and see what happens in the presses there but another option that I am looking up top there is um is Nicholas Jackson actually um and that would save me 0. five there um having a look at the numbers uh for Nicholas and and havit now obviously this season we've only had three but it's it's actually quite similar in terms of the numbers if you have a look at this season compared to last season between the two of them um I just popped on to the play heat maps on on the fantasy football fix website and had a look at the the differences between the two players there and it's funny enough as Nicholas Jackson who comes out trumps in terms of sort of expected um expected goals his his sort of shots shots on targets these are these are average statistics per 90 minutes yeah um that's obviously Kai havit that's a little bit more creative so it means that his expected assists are are slightly better but it it's slightly slightly better and I think Nicholas Jackson has got a a bit of a bad rep I mean he scored 14 last season compared to hav 13 um Kit's expected goals last season were just under 12 so he was pretty much bang on he was a goal out in terms of expected and what he actually uh performed with um nichas Jackson's expected goals last season was was over 18 he scored 14 so if they're kind of you know going to what we should expect uh Nicholas Jackson you would could argue is a slightly better option there so um it's it's really just the case of of how you see that Chelsea team fitting together and again uh I wouldn't call it a risk but it's it's obviously he's a lot less owned um than than someone like Kai havit but um I quite like that because he's lerone and it just gives me that you know age that foot in to a player who can who can you know get me a better uh get me a better rank if he does well definitely love it not a name that I was expecting to to hear you talk around and I guess the kai hit's situation as well with ard's injury on the international break as well we have a Raheem Sterling shaped uh Challenger as well to the offensive lineup in Arsenal to consider and it'll be interesting to see how he finds his way presumably into that starting lineup as well so a few unknowns there with with Arsenal as well got to ask you it's nice segue in a moment we're going to take a look at some stats as well but before we do that do you think this team is is what you're going to you're going to rock into game week four with I mean we like you say we're recording Tuesday evening we don't yet know prognosis assuming no injuries assuming positive news on J Pedro's travel schedule and what and what have you or is there anything that you're sort of thinking do you know what I can't confidently say this is how I'm gonna I'm going to shake out and if so who's who's most at risk yeah it's it's the habits leaz and canate options that are that are at risk for me at the moment I'm probably 75% happy that this is the team I will go in with um if I am spooked a little bit with leis Diaz's minutes just because of intern and obviously with the Champions League starting up in the next sort of week or two um then I may choose to downgrading and go with a Brighton Midfield and and go with the trends and Chase that upside as opposed to going a little bit more sort of dard and and just going with canate in there um so those are the three that are sort of up for grabs me at the moment and I think I need to I need to take slight risks yeah because I've gone for the Wild Card a little bit earlier than than a lot of people would do and and the reason I did that it was just simply because I think we need to think about the Wild Card slightly different this season with the rule changes and that we've that wild card for us has always been a bit of a safety nit it's always been there and we don't want to use it early in the season obviously because we don't have a whole lot of data to go on and if we get it wrong there isn't that safety net after we've used it there isn't that bank of transfers we could have previously to be able to fix what might not have quite worked out the way it had previously or how you wanted so going into a wild card this season seems like it's just a it's not a sort of a hard stop and then you're kind of starting again with that particular wild card it's almost as if it can be just a part of your transfers and I've got two free transfers with which I'm taking into this obviously naturally when your wild carding is setting up for those next two or three at least you shouldn't need to use a transfer for the next game week or two after a wild card God willing so the idea is to go into game week six or seven with at least three or four transfers and that's when I think the majority of managers are going to be using that wild card it's it just seems to be most sort of natural time to do so what I'm trying to do here is get a little bit of a head start to eventally I'm taking a little bit of a risk because I'm I'm choosing players based on slightly less data than those other managers will have what I'm ultimately saying is that I I don't see the landscape changing too much in the next two or three game weeks between my wild card and theirs and even if it does somewhat I will have transfers in the bank now to be able to react to that whereas obviously wouldn't have had that previously so um and the other side of that obviously as the price Rises I've managed to to grab I think if I if I had to Wild Cod now this team would cost me 0. five or so more and I I wouldn't be able to afford it to be perfectly honest so um all things going well I could have a team in game week six that others are are looking to get into but can't quite afford so you know that's obviously if if all things go well over the next two or three game weeks so it's it's a calculated risk and and one that I'd like to take as I I'd like to attack it a little bit more this season 100% definitely lovely lovely way of summing it up and it'll be interesting to see how that plays out going into game weeks you know six and and seven and Beyond and I'll be interested it be about the time that we'll get you back on the channel around that Andrew I would have thought so it'll be interesting to to take note of your points now and and reflect back on them when we when we catch up in a couple of game weeks time Andrew we're going to end the video this time with taking a look at some statistics I know You' mentioned data points have not been uh that plentiful yet with only three games week worth of data um in the books but I think it's still interesting to take a look at a new feature on the Elite 11 team reveal so let's take a look the game weeks one through three stats so far okay guys so what we've got here so far is game weeks 1 through three data and we're presenting totals here rather than averages these may think be stats that we Chang around and if you do have any um that you particularly like then do please pop them into the comments and we shall we'll see what we can uh do but at the moment we've pulled out some of the key ones that we think would be of interest to managers when they're making their transfers or if they are on wild cards we're looking at expected goals attempted assists shots shots in the Box expected FPL points and expected goals conceded that team metric in the bottom right hand corner there all of these stats are available on fantasy footballfix.com you''ve got the sandbox you can create your own tables and there's just a multitude of tools that you can go and have a play with of course guyses but Andrew I've got to ask you when you're looking at the this data and I'm sure you um have you know taken a look at the stats yourself you mentioned Nicholas Jackson there he's a name that I wasn't expecting to to have mentioned is backed up with the XG that you've you've talked around there as well but one player who we didn't see on your wild card Drive is seeno who's impressed in game weeks one through three look at the shot total there what's he got to do to find his way in Andrew what's this guy going to do to impress you oh it just simply comes down to the fixt for me um like I said I I am kind of looking at that 5.5 million option in the midfield if I do want to so upgrade the defense there but um so I did have a look at cenia and the numbers he is by far the best option if you are looking in that bracket um Smith row I've I've kind of like I said I've kind of gone off full him a little bit so he's not exciting me too much I think I'd rather go with the m option even if it is just short term for for gameing four and five obviously had a look at simino but it's just the fixtures unfortunately just just put me off um yeah I see and he's a little bit more expensive than Rogers as well isn't he you meant Rogers was in your your team I guess as your fifth Choice midfielder as the budget and he's more expensive isn't he I'm interested in this calling on Fulham just before we wrap things up um Andrew I'm I'm looking at them here they're expected goals conceded they're they're fifth best so far you've got the likes of um mun who's not not returned loads of points but lots of shots in the Box you got Andreas Pereira and tempted assists what is it about them that's that's putting you off man is it is it a fixtures thing is it a a begrudging feeling as a munis owner what's what's your read I'm intrigued yeah probably um yeah I mean it's one of those other things that is quite annoying I'm actually going to the fulam game on Saturday so getting rid of on the wild card was was quite difficult to be honest I'll probably go there and he'll he'll Smash in the brace um no it's not so much that I don't want them in my in my team I think those fixtures start getting a little bit more difficult now and and we got to remember that the last um two game weeks have been against promoted teams in in Leicester and nip switch so um the numbers will look quite decent for them because of those two fixtures I think um but now they go to West Ham West Ham at home not not too bad um I do expect West time to score um then they've got Newcastle knowy we think and then they've got Man City and ason Villa so I'm just say I'm not quite expecting as much of them in the in the next three to four game weeks as I perhaps was in those first you know three game weeks that we had yeah I see perfectly reasonable I'm only teasing and I hope you have a great time at the cottage I'm sure you you will do Andrew mate it's been a pleasure you've given me tons of food for thought on my own wild card I'm sure folks watching as well who are also on wild card will have lots of thoughts and if you do have thoughts guys do pop them into the comments as well and do please of course smash a like on the video as well if you haven't already done so Andrew is there anything else on your on your mind before we wrap things up anything else you want to get off your chest um no no I don't think so I was just just having a look through those that data there and I think it was I think it was Harry who was saying on Twitter today the moones the shots in the Box 11 I think he mentioned that seven of those were headers and I think one of them was a big chance so I think it probably needs to be taken with a slight pinch of salt that um but besides that they're interesting numbers and I think there's you know a lot to be taken from that even though there is only three game weeks worth and I think a lot of the time we we tend to overthink things a little bit and it's usually the obvious option that's the right one so it's nice to be thinking of certain players and having those particular payers pop up here um there are obviously the fixtures that we just need to take into account which is why you know the likes of those those Bourn withth guys are are probably not going to make it in unfortunately for me no I see mate and if I'd seen a wild card draft with the likes of you know Andre Pereira and Dwight mcneel and tavanir in in the side I would have been wondering whether or not you'd perhaps read too much into the data at this early stage of the season but you're too too much of an esteem veteran for that to happen M it's been a pleasure going to be intriguing to see how the world card shapes out thanks for your patience last week as well mate between you and me that was a a tough one but I'm glad we've got this video uh sorted for the guys ahead of gameweek four and guys if you've enjoyed it do please as I say smash a like on the video do please head over to Fantasy footballfix.com And subscribe if you haven't already done so And subscribe to the channel as well it' be great to to get your support and guys I'll be back next week um after game week four is in the books have a great week take care bye-bye [Music],7224,hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel with me tom c you can find me on x utterly tc and guys we are getting our way through this tedious international break were all but finished now so consequently were back with another elite 11 team reveal and im super excited to say that ive got andrew neeve on this week im always pleased to talk to andrew but this week especially as he is on his wild card so am im sure lots of you watching are as well and were going to talk through all of the wild card strategies guys so without further ado lets get right into it andrew mate welcome back to the channel my friend and of course weve got wild card chat to come going to ask you to pause the wild card chat for now and just briefly sum up hows the start of the season been mate no problem at all its been a bit of a mixed bag i think game one wasnt great at all gameing 2 went well nice big green arrow and game three again just a bit and that was just singlehandedly came down to that liverpool game at the end of last game week so its been okay i think if you said to me at the beginning of the season after gameing three if he just outside that top million i probably would have said okay ill take that last season it took me about 16 or 17 game weeks to get to where i am now so certainly not going to complain well have a look at how things went in the last particular game week but it did just come down to that lack of liverpool coverage and just only having one liverpool player in the side i see and we will look back at game week three andrew of course like you mentioned like we were talking off camera beforehand that its pretty far in the rearview mirror but we will take a look at the team that you have left behind you now in a couple of minutes ive got to ask you though so behind the scenes little spoiler guys we were attempting to record this video last week but the tech gremlins im afraid put paid to that but its worked out well because you werent on wild card at that particular point andrew you pressed the button subsequent to that so ive got to ask you what prompted that mate was it something that was in the offing all the time and it was borderline at that time or was this more of a a strategic decision that you were always likely to make around game weeks three and four very borderline to be honest with it was it was a 5050 call and i think it was it ultimately came down to the injury to bailey for me that probably tipped it the other way and the fact that i had to make transfers going into the next game week to put a decent enough side out on game week four and i hadnt pulled the trigger at the end of sunday evening i think it might have been perhaps the monday or the tuesday afterwards and it was after thinking about it a whole lot more and well chat about it and we do go through the wild card but theres a definite shift in how ive ive had to think about how the wild card has played this season compared to last just simply because of those rule changes so its just having that extra nights or two to think about it and then go well hold on maybe it does make sense for me to try and attack things a little bit more thats what ultimately led me to go okay well lets lets go for it i see makes sense mate and in terms of the first three game weeks had you got to the position of not needing to use any free transfers prior to pressing the wild card and are youve going to have youve retained those through the wild card is that the situation youre in ive made one transfer and that was for quaner i started the season with him in gaming one and i think its again its it was such a fine line between going wild card and not going wild card i think if sequan had still been continuing in the side and it started for liverpool for those three games pretty sure i wouldnt have wild carded but the fact that i had to get rid of him in game week one sitting with bco on my bench i had an injury to bailey last game week thats what ultimately led me to go well lets think about this wild card a little bit more seriously i see mate well lets lets look backwards before we look forward and take a look how the points played out in gw three okay so im sure youll be happy to say this is no longer the team but its not a disaster to me andrew like im sure that this is going to be a team that resembles a lot of the folks watching here as well so its a while ago since you acred those points but i got to ask you in terms of the team that you put this together would you still be comfortable if you were in a position whereby you hadnt pressed the wild card you decided to retain this squad for whatever reason andrew putting aside the bailey injury do you still think that the core of this team is a solid enough base for an fpl manager to have worked with absolutely which is why i say it was it was such a close call with guys are going with the wild card or not i had two free transfers i saved my transfer in game week three so i could have done a inac down to shao pedro for example and upgraded bailey and used those two free transfers but there were a few players at the risk of losing value and there was an obvious lack of certain liverpool players in there too and not having a liverpool defensive player there that i wanted to ultimately jump on and couldnt get there comfortably with just those two free transfers and i didnt ultimately want to end up wasting those transfers in a way for players that i expected i would have gotten on a wild card in the next couple of game weeks i always had the plan of wild carding early this particular season it was always going to be between four and six ill be completely honest with you going into that last game week on last weeks sunday game week three i even then thought well dont need to wild card and ultimately i didnt need to wild card this its a decent enough side and i think theres a lot of players there that can hurt me jumping off of them onto different players that ive got in on my wild card but thats ultimately the risk you take and that can happen in any game week regardless of whether youre playing your wild card or not in regardless of how early in the season it might be absolutely i couldnt couldnt agree more when i looked at this beforehand i just s thought it is a strong squad but youve articulated it well im going to move us on andrew because im sure the people watching are as fascinated as they will have been about the introductory summation that weve given them they want to see this wild card squad and they want to hear your thoughts as to some of the decisions that youve made and which 5050s im sure are still in the offing so lets move us on guys and take a little look at this gw four wild card squad that andrews put together but im not going to do it straight away look at those grade out pictures there weve decided to tease you a little bit guys and you would have seen there are time stamps on the video now is probably an opportune time to say of course that you can head over to fantasy footballfixcom if you havent already done so and follow the thoughts of our elite managers and of course andrew is in that cohort of players and you can follow his wild card thoughts before game week four get started so andrew lets go through this piece by piece then lets start with the goalkeeper here and im going to reveal him now so ry was previously the goalkeeper prior to the wild card was there anybody else in the offing here in terms of someone who might rival that spot or are you pretty happy with him as being the best route into the arsenal defense to be honest i was probably one of the easiest decisions id made on the wild card i started the season with rea and with fabianski and goal and havent changed them on my wild card more than happy with both of them the fabianski core was the reason i went with him besides any the other four mill options was just simply because he seemed like the one of those keepers who could at some stage make his way into the first team now i dont know whether hes going to continue doing so with with the injury to arola on the weekend it sounds like hes fine so but im im not relying on him in any way whatsoever ray will be playing every game we for me im just not excited at all by the 45 options all the five m options to be perfectly honest so he was always someone that was just a simple easy one for me to stick in and probably not all that likely to treble up on west ham options so youre not going to be blocking your root to any west ham players by having fabianski in goal he says as a west ham fan smiling so i get it all right lets move on and take a look at the back three that youve selected mate so weve got some budget options here right across the board and well come on and talk about the bench in a moment here but rur the player thats been attracting a lot of attention in the man city backline get your thoughts on him and whether or not you believe him to be a secure selection coner thats not the person you mentioned earlier of course from villa you talking about the liverpool defender in game one and canate whos found his way into the team here as well so talk me through these options andrew and what looks like a pretty budget backat line is that strategically different from how you were expecting to work things out absolutely and i will cave at that just by saying that kate option there is open to move theres a few theres probably about three spots in my wild card that are that could change funny enough its its a forward and midfielder and a defender and konato is one of them there is the option of downgrading one of my midfielders to upgrade kate to either a robertson or a trent alexander arnold but regardless of what i do in that position its going to be a liverpool defender i think defensively theyve looked fantastic this season and those next two in particular are amazing for them going game week seven with wolves too so i think i need that defensive coverage so kate is in there just simply as coverage i dont its its not the most exciting thing to do when youve got attacking fullbacks in that liverpool team that you should rarely be getting in if youve got the funds to do so but he was someone that i just thought if i stick him in there at least im covering those clean sheets with those guys if they dont get attacking returns then ive come out trumps i get it on the canate speaking as an ex owner of him in previous seasons the thing thats irritated me with him is discipline and the yellow card seem to follow him around and that can be ever so frustrating but i get it is a cheap route into what looks like a great route for clean sheets and guys we will take a look at some statistics in a few moments time as well and youll youll see straight away there the liverpool defense is definitely sticking out positively lets talk around man city defense then we a believer in lewis or is this a hope pick andrew or is it a little bit of both its a hope pick its an upside chase and its its one of those players in there that i like when i when i choose teams each week i like having those one or two players that are just at someone that you can hope comes right for you a little bit of a risky pick and with lys 100 its a risky p i absolutely realize that but one that can come right for me if it doesnt work out then i dont need him in game weeks five and six and can then look to get rid of him with three threee transfers in game week six so absolutely a risky pick i realized that and another reason why those other players that i have in there that im considering moving on or perhaps not starting within this wild card its just simply because i want to mitigate that risk and lewis is definitely a risk i understand it feels like a risk worth taking particularly on wild card at that at that price under 5m to get into the potentially get into the man city defense and i like the robinson selection there on the bench as well andrew should it go south theyve got decent fixtures still havent they and hes impressed hasnt he in the opening few game weeks anthony robertson at fullback as a as a fourth option substitute absolutely he was my transfering in game we two for for cona who didnt end up continuing in the liverpool backline so quite happy that ive got him hes come right in game week two and three i think it is with the assists so quite happy to have them and as a 45 mil option theres not that many other exciting on in there like i dont hold out too much hope for the fulham backline to be honest with you im going cold on fulham somewhat but regardless of that he has that attacking threat and for 45m hes proba a little bit more im sure hes one of those that have gone up since quite happy for him to stay there low risk play coner youve picked up from aston villa here andrew know that their fixtures are improving after they after a tough start in terms of that villa collective do you think theres any risk here with the with the champions league starting up and being a bit of an unknown quantity we know how much emory values european competition and why wouldnt he than the champions league level do you think this is this is likely to see an impact on their fpl minutes as a collective or are we pretty confident that their strong season last seasons going to be replicated look i dont think any of us expect villa to do as well this season as they as they did last season its going to be a lot tougher for them with that european football but coner was he was just probably my pick of the 45m options at the beginning of season i started with him game week one and given the fixtures that aston villa have from game week three onwards for at least the next four or five game weeks i think hes going to be an ever presentes and okay again its im not expecting the world from asille defensively but if you compare them to any of the other 45m options that we have i think theyre probably one of the best bets okay interesting lets move on talked enough around the defense people want to see well this money being saved hows it been being spent so lets take a look at this midfield and you can see theres theres a fair amount of chunk of change being invested here and we can also talk around and bumo as well sitting there on the bench andrew youve gone for this double liverpool attacking compliment here in midfield of lou diaz and mosalah lets start there do you think this is the best contingent of liverpool options the canate louis diaz and salah in terms of then what that allowed you to do elsewhere in the squad perhaps what allows you to do elsewhere yes you could your best option in defense is going to be train alexand rold and its mentioning earlier the options that i might think about downgrading somewhat to allow for the upgrade of kate to trend is lis diaz and he could go down to a midfielder for me i like the look of m at 55 he only played i think about 47 minutes in that first game week had to come up with that concussion precaution but hes looked very good out otherwise so i quite like to look at him at 55 and that frees up that two million to go canate to trent alexand arnold it just means that i then need to probably move on in game week six because im not so excited about those bright and fixtures from game week six so thats one of the options for me if you can afford trent and seller in the side thats going to be optimal this year is also another a bit of a worry playing for colombia midweek this week weve got to have a look at what is his minutes were like and im going to wait until friday probably saturday morning to see if we hear on whether he is going to start or not but if there is any whispers or if i start getting cold feet on him and whether he is going to start or not then thats one of the moves im looking at lining up and switching things out it means having one less liverpool player and i go into game week four with my wild card with just two liverpool players as opposed to three but another option for me is going usda m canate to roberts or i could i could look at the option of keeping him there and then going lewis to canata or lewis to robertson alexand rold keeping canata there and downgrading a third player who ill go through and we talk about our forward options there so the liverpool players are up for up for grabs at the moment for me havent quite settled on exactly who im going to have there i would like to have three going into the next two game weeks just simply because of how good they are it could be that i double up on the defense and maybe mitigate the the risk i have with lewis and getting rid of him for another liverpool backline player so many so many permutations arent they there andrew and i think i just wanted to get your thoughts on that that in years gone by the prospect of having robertson and alexander arnold as a double up was fairly normal right to talk around that ive not seen it for some considerable time has that entered your thoughts at all when youve been considering your wild card computations of possibly even investing six million and seven million in robertson and trent alexander arnold praying for the clean sheets and looking at them as their attacking output as well cuz its certainly something that im looking at on wild card completely different con construct to what youre looking at is it something on your mind too absolutely ive never been one thats liked spending too much in defense i think trent alexander arnold needs to be the exception to that i dont think id be going both trent and robertson and myself just purely because of the money involved there thats just a personal option id rather take that extra mill and go trenton canate and spend that extra m in in attack thats just the way ive always played ive prefer to move that money further up the pitch makes sense to me all right cool and just before we take a look at the forwards guys i do want to ask you around ando there super tough fixture coming back in gw four away at man city but hes as close to being fixture proof anyway at that upper mid price in midfield anyway with his talismanic status all but confirmed with ianony longer no longer being part of brentfords operations right so in terms ofuma if you had to no real quams in playing him in game week four anyway if people already own him its its just the fact that youre on wild card and youve got a team that can allow you to that luxury right absolutely look if you can afford to bench a player like u because hes playing away at man city then you a great luxury to have but if you were forced into playing him if you perhaps didnt have someone on the bench that could come on to replace him for that particular game week i dont think theres anything wrong with playing in bu moto city havent exactly looked fantastic defensively and if hi switch can get it them then then brenford can certainly what ive tried to do with this particular team is try and set myself up with the wild card youre trying to set yourself up for as long term as possible that changes slightly with the rule changes and something i can i can chat over in a little bit once weve got through all of all of my options on in the front line there too but what ive tried to do is set this team up in a way that i have either got those players that i expect the gw six wild card is to have or its easy enough for me to get them in and bran is just a classic example of that i think come game week six hes going to be very highly owned just simply because of that fantastic run of fixtures that that brenford have from game week six and hes one of those players that youre more than happy coming off the bench if anything does happen to any one of your starters absolutely good thoughts mate all right well weve teased it long enough lets take a look at the front line okay so you mentioned the bright fixtures you like initially so xiao pedro finds his way in hes weve got captain erling harand probably dont need to talk around him too much there andrew and kai ht makes his way into the team as well i think he has 81m at the time of recording so talk to me around this trio andrew and how youve arrived at this selection of forwards i think i think harand and j pedro speak for them so pedro is a little bit of a worry getting that call up to res i think were recording this on tuesday night so unsure of his minutes at the moment but i dont think he gets that many minutes internationally and id be optimistic that he starts on the weekend against hip switch so im going to hang on to him i think hes as good an option as you can get in that particular price bracket and hes a fantastic option for the next few games game weeks he is shortterm for me i think brighton as a whole are shortterm for me i think those fixtures from gw six just get particularly bad for them so i do have a plan to either bench shiao pedro in game week six and play those existing four midfielders that i have and buo obvious he comes in for jeia pedro or i can get rid of him game week six just depending on what information we get between now and then habits is the other player that mentioned earlier that is up for grabs theres the news the od guard injury during the week ill be honest with you i havent had enough time to give enough thoughts as to how that might affect him i havent read up on whether jes zeus looks like hes going to be fit enough to play if he is then thats a big minus in havit his box there because hes likely to be dropped back a lot further but im not just going to simply assume thats going to be the case just because of that injury i want to give it a few days and see what happens in the presses there but another option that i am looking up top there is is nicholas jackson and that would save me 0 five there having a look at the numbers for nicholas and havit now this season weve only had three but its its quite similar in terms of the numbers if you have a look at this season compared to last season between the two of them i just popped on to the play heat maps on the fantasy football fix website and had a look at the differences between the two players there and its funny enough as nicholas jackson who comes out trumps in terms of expected expected goals his shots on targets these are these are average statistics per 90 minutes thats kai havit thats a little bit more creative so it means that his expected assists are slightly better but its slightly better and i think nicholas jackson has got a bit of a bad rep he scored 14 last season compared to hav 13 kits expected goals last season were just under 12 so he was pretty much bang on he was a goal out in terms of expected and what he performed with nichas jacksons expected goals last season was over 18 he scored 14 so if theyre going to what we should expect nicholas jackson you would could argue is a slightly better option there so its its just the case of how you see that chelsea team fitting together and again i wouldnt call it a risk but its its hes a lot less owned than someone like kai havit but i quite like that because hes lerone and it just gives me that age that foot in to a player who can who can get me a better get me a better rank if he does well definitely love it not a name that i was expecting to hear you talk around and the kai hits situation as well with ards injury on the international break as well we have a raheem sterling shaped challenger as well to the offensive lineup in arsenal to consider and itll be interesting to see how he finds his way presumably into that starting lineup as well so a few unknowns there with arsenal as well got to ask you its nice segue in a moment were going to take a look at some stats as well but before we do that do you think this team is what youre going to youre going to rock into game week four with we like you say were recording tuesday evening we dont yet know prognosis assuming no injuries assuming positive news on j pedros travel schedule and what and what have you or is there anything that youre thinking do what i cant confidently say this is how im gonna im going to shake out and if so whos whos most at risk its its the habits leaz and canate options that are that are at risk for me at the moment im probably 75 happy that this is the team i will go in with if i am spooked a little bit with leis diazs minutes just because of intern and with the champions league starting up in the next week or two then i may choose to downgrading and go with a brighton midfield and go with the trends and chase that upside as opposed to going a little bit more dard and just going with canate in there so those are the three that are up for grabs me at the moment and i think i need to i need to take slight risks because ive gone for the wild card a little bit earlier than a lot of people would do and the reason i did that it was just simply because i think we need to think about the wild card slightly different this season with the rule changes and that weve that wild card for us has always been a bit of a safety nit its always been there and we dont want to use it early in the season because we dont have a whole lot of data to go on and if we get it wrong there isnt that safety net after weve used it there isnt that bank of transfers we could have previously to be able to fix what might not have quite worked out the way it had previously or how you wanted so going into a wild card this season seems like its just a its not a a hard stop and then youre starting again with that particular wild card its almost as if it can be just a part of your transfers and ive got two free transfers with which im taking into this naturally when your wild carding is setting up for those next two or three at least you shouldnt need to use a transfer for the next game week or two after a wild card god willing so the idea is to go into game week six or seven with at least three or four transfers and thats when i think the majority of managers are going to be using that wild card its it just seems to be most natural time to do so what im trying to do here is get a little bit of a head start to eventally im taking a little bit of a risk because im im choosing players based on slightly less data than those other managers will have what im ultimately saying is that i dont see the landscape changing too much in the next two or three game weeks between my wild card and theirs and even if it does somewhat i will have transfers in the bank now to be able to react to that whereas wouldnt have had that previously so and the other side of that as the price rises ive managed to grab i think if i if i had to wild cod now this team would cost me 0 five or so more and i wouldnt be able to afford it to be perfectly honest so all things going well i could have a team in game week six that others are looking to get into but cant quite afford so thats if all things go well over the next two or three game weeks so its its a calculated risk and one that id like to take as id like to attack it a little bit more this season 100 definitely lovely way of summing it up and itll be interesting to see how that plays out going into game weeks six and seven and beyond and ill be interested it be about the time that well get you back on the channel around that andrew i would have thought so itll be interesting to take note of your points now and reflect back on them when we when we catch up in a couple of game weeks time andrew were going to end the video this time with taking a look at some statistics i know you mentioned data points have not been that plentiful yet with only three games week worth of data in the books but i think its still interesting to take a look at a new feature on the elite 11 team reveal so lets take a look the game weeks one through three stats so far okay guys so what weve got here so far is game weeks 1 through three data and were presenting totals here rather than averages these may think be stats that we chang around and if you do have any that you particularly like then do please pop them into the comments and we shall well see what we can do but at the moment weve pulled out some of the key ones that we think would be of interest to managers when theyre making their transfers or if they are on wild cards were looking at expected goals attempted assists shots in the box expected fpl points and expected goals conceded that team metric in the bottom right hand corner there all of these stats are available on fantasy footballfixcom youve got the sandbox you can create your own tables and theres just a multitude of tools that you can go and have a play with of course guyses but andrew ive got to ask you when youre looking at the this data and im sure you have taken a look at the stats yourself you mentioned nicholas jackson there hes a name that i wasnt expecting to have mentioned is backed up with the xg that youve youve talked around there as well but one player who we didnt see on your wild card drive is seeno whos impressed in game weeks one through three look at the shot total there whats he got to do to find his way in andrew whats this guy going to do to impress you it just simply comes down to the fixt for me like i said i am looking at that 55m option in the midfield if i do want to so upgrade the defense there but so i did have a look at cenia and the numbers he is by far the best option if you are looking in that bracket smith row ive ive like i said ive gone off full him a little bit so hes not exciting me too much i think id rather go with the m option even if it is just short term for gameing four and five had a look at simino but its just the fixtures unfortunately just put me off i see and hes a little bit more expensive than rogers as well isnt he you meant rogers was in your team as your fifth choice midfielder as the budget and hes more expensive isnt he im interested in this calling on fulham just before we wrap things up andrew im im looking at them here theyre expected goals conceded theyre theyre fifth best so far youve got the likes of mun whos not returned loads of points but lots of shots in the box you got andreas pereira and tempted assists what is it about them thats thats putting you off man is it is it a fixtures thing is it a begrudging feeling as a munis owner whats whats your read im intrigued probably its one of those other things that is quite annoying im going to the fulam game on saturday so getting rid of on the wild card was quite difficult to be honest ill probably go there and hell hell smash in the brace no its not so much that i dont want them in my in my team i think those fixtures start getting a little bit more difficult now and we got to remember that the last two game weeks have been against promoted teams in leicester and nip switch so the numbers will look quite decent for them because of those two fixtures i think but now they go to west ham west ham at home not too bad i do expect west time to score then theyve got newcastle knowy we think and then theyve got man city and ason villa so im just say im not quite expecting as much of them in the in the next three to four game weeks as i perhaps was in those first three game weeks that we had i see perfectly reasonable im only teasing and i hope you have a great time at the cottage im sure you will do andrew mate its been a pleasure youve given me tons of food for thought on my own wild card im sure folks watching as well who are also on wild card will have lots of thoughts and if you do have thoughts guys do pop them into the comments as well and do please of course smash a like on the video as well if you havent already done so andrew is there anything else on your on your mind before we wrap things up anything else you want to get off your chest no i dont think so i was just having a look through those that data there and i think it was i think it was harry who was saying on twitter today the moones the shots in the box 11 i think he mentioned that seven of those were headers and i think one of them was a big chance so i think it probably needs to be taken with a slight pinch of salt that but besides that theyre interesting numbers and i think theres a lot to be taken from that even though there is only three game weeks worth and i think a lot of the time we tend to overthink things a little bit and its usually the obvious option thats the right one so its nice to be thinking of certain players and having those particular payers pop up here there are the fixtures that we just need to take into account which is why the likes of those bourn withth guys are probably not going to make it in unfortunately for me no i see mate and if id seen a wild card draft with the likes of andre pereira and dwight mcneel and tavanir in the side i would have been wondering whether or not youd perhaps read too much into the data at this early stage of the season but youre too much of an esteem veteran for that to happen m its been a pleasure going to be intriguing to see how the world card shapes out thanks for your patience last week as well mate between you and me that was a tough one but im glad weve got this video sorted for the guys ahead of gw four and guys if youve enjoyed it do please as i say smash a like on the video do please head over to fantasy footballfixcom and subscribe if you havent already done so and subscribe to the channel as well it be great to get your support and guys ill be back next week after game week four is in the books have a great week take care byebye,6702
8,fantasyfootballfixYT,JcNY6U3xW7A,🤖 AI WILDCARD FPL TEAM REVEAL GAMEWEEK 4 | Eddie vs Algorithm | Fantasy Premier League 24/45 Tips,2024-09-06T12:00:31Z,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix YouTube channel my name is FPL Phillips and it's going to be a week of Eddie versus the algorithm where this week during International break we're taking a look at Wild Card drafts but once again it's going to be the algorithm team up against my own personal Wild Card draft that I have put together and to be honest I'm very close to going for if one more injury or one thing goes wrong during the international break I've made an early transfer my own personal team which if it backfires then I'll be hitting the Wild Card button I've put together their team that I'm Cy on when I will hit the chip I know I'm losing out on a bit of money but that is the cost of what I'm going for as I'm not 100% certain on it but the algorithm has put together its own team using its calculated formulas and all that stuff I'm very excited to take a look at it hopefully you guys are two to help you with your own personal decision making over this game week for FPL I know the international break is boring but if you could drop a like on the video and subscribe down below if you want to stay tuned for more FPL content when the football does eventually return then make sure to do that that would be much appreciated but without any further Ado let's get into the video shall we and kick things off as always with the algorithm [Music] side so we have the algorithm lining up in a 442 for this game week and it's not going to be doing that every week of course but for game we 4 it's going to be in this formation andc things off with the goalkeeper between the sticks it is going to be Dean Henderson of Crystal Palace which I thought is an interesting shout the goalkeeper that I currently own and have been with the majority of his owners rather disappointed with however there is still good justification for him remaining one of the top 4.5 million options he's you know nailed on keeper for aide that last season had very good defense uh he's a decent fixture in gameweek four or be it granted after that there's a bit of a mixed bundle however we've already seen in game week 3 and over the course of last season as well how clean sheets are going to be more difficult to come by this year and if you're going for a 4.5 million option it's going to be difficult to expect clean sheets what I'd be more disappointed with with Henderson is that him on an individual notes has been quite poor and I think that his XG prevented is not going to be great this year I'm not sure he's going to make an awful lot of saves I in general don't just rate him as a keeper so if it was Sam Johnston or someone else that I thought was maybe a bit more capable in goal then it might be a different story at Crystal Palace if I could back them to make saves someone like aeno in goal there would do well I think because be able to keep a lot shots out however Henderson just hasn't shown that yet for me from what I've watched the Crystal Palace let me know if you think otherwise but he's just overall not impressed me on the eye I've not looked at a load of stats with him with regards to that and how he compares to the other 4.5s but I'd be more likely to jump on someone maybe just like a fleam I know he's got two tricky fixures coming up but if you're looking very long term with this wild card then you do have to look ahead of those next two game weeks and you're not going to want to be making a goalkeeper transfer that's one of the that's probably the position where you least want to use transfers uh after your wild card and so for me a set for G keeper is very important over you know 10 or 20 game weeks really if you can look that far on a wild card so for me if you're going with a 4.5 you could probably look elsewhere from Henderson uh there are some okay rotation options you can go for with him but 4.5 mil keeper rotation doesn't always work out well for I would just use 5.5 million and and go for a more expensive Keeper in that bundle which I'll explain when we have a look at my side why I've chosen to do that uh in defense I'm interested to see who is lining up in this back four we have Trent Alexander rold Rico Lewis Mitchell and then lukin so some very differential picks in here a few that I've seen mentioned once or twice and then two very popular picks in FPL at the moment Tren Alexander Arnold first and foremost is performing very well has the most has the best expected FPL data uh if you use the opto stats tool over on fantasy football fix he is top of that and quite some margin ahead of everyone else Robertson his teammate only down in fourth and so Trends attacking data is looking pretty good albeit he hasn't had those Mega holes that will get everyone talking about him over these first few game weeks but I still think that he is a very very capable option and one that it's difficult to turn away from when Liverpool especially are keeping clean sheets Trent does start to be able to justify that seven million price tag last season he was what 8 million Liverpool weren't keeping as many clean sheets this season it's going to be looking a lot better for him I think it's set up well for him to come through with some of those returns whil everyone's in a bit of a scramble to maybe getting some of the big guns up front and in Midfield maybe CH Alexander Arnold will come into his own over these next three or four games for Liverpool which do look really nice indeed so having an optimal Liverpool triple up is probably something that a lot of managers are going to be looking at Rico Lewis is the one I want to discuss next one has had some controversy around him you've got other competitions starting up for Manchester City and this is going to prove uh pivotal in the RICO lose to barle whether or not he can prove himself uh for minutes in the Premier League really so you're see going to see mixed things I don't think anyone knows for sure even sources who are very you in the know at Manchester City will find it difficult to predict this one and how it's going to fit in with Kyle Walker all I can go off is my opinion based on what I've seen so far this season from pepep and experience of being trolled by him in the past but Rico Le has been trusted with a lot so far this season a lot more than we've seen in any previous campaign and it's unsurprising really he's a young player coming through and he has looked exceptional and if this is anything to go on I think that Lewis is going to remain a very good option for the rest of the season he's already up at 4.6 million and he looks very very attacking when he's on the pitch everyone's talking about how you V's tucking in Rico Lewis is the one advancing making those runs getting into those Advanced areas where he's picking up some good underlying expected data he's already rattled the crossbar uh he's he's had a lot of chances and I think he's going to come good and to be honest at that price point for a Manchester City Defender I think it's kind of worth it where there's not too many other 4.5 million options shining in defense right now if you've got the bench I think you can afford to take the punt uh and so this team presumably does have that was the other sides I think will have that as well I think Rico Lewis is worth a money personally and I would have him in on a wild card draft let's say that the other two of very interesting pick there's a double up on crystal palace defense with Mitchell which I would definitely not be justifying based on what I've seen so far from them anyway he has been getting forward a lot Mitchell I still don't think he's a better pick than Muno All Things Considered uh and so I'm a bit confused as why he's in here he has been picked I think by the algorthm team once in the past so maybe there's a bit of a liking to him maybe he'll come good in this Leicester fixture but as mention there a bit of a mix bag for Crystal Palace up next so I'm interested by that pick and then Luca Dean at Aston Villa is interesting one as I have seen things from Villa fans claiming that they want Matson to start he's obviously assigning that they spent 440 million p on in the summer I assumed he was going to come in and be first choice at some point just didn't know when that point is would it be game week two would it be game we one but they've waited at least three game weeks at Aston Villa and I think maybe game we four could be the one and either way I think you've kind of just got a bit of a ticking time bomb with Luca Dean one that you maybe don't want if you've got other Defenders like Rico Lewis in granted l in is a pretty cheap option he's on my however forever FPL trolls list and for that reason can never step foot anywhere near my team a total logic totally logical reason for never picking the guy again but he has just proven himself to be an FPL Troll and I don't trust him to do anything else but troll down the line to be honest as well uh so saying that I think you're going to get an early sub from him every game if he does start so not that much potential for attacking returns but Baston Villa do have a good set of fixtures coming up next he could grab some attacking returns of course during those first 60 minutes but if you're looking just for the clean sheets anyway then I'm not sure why you wouldn't just go for someone like a coner who's more assured for minutes okay Lucine might go off and then Villa could concede and you could get a clean sheet bang that way but I just don't think it's worth the risk when you've got someone like a Lewis in the side as well in particular uh it just doesn't make too much sense to me and so for that reason I I wouldn't be owning Lucine right now in Midfield we're going to see Muhammad Salah e Diego jot and then Morgan Rogers a Midfield that I really do like the look of I think Salah is going to be on every wild card team really I think if anyone's going to choose to drop one of Harland or Salah most teams are choosing to drop earning harand right now which you def fixes and everything like that Liverpool have a fantastic three games coming up and I think the optimal triple up therefore the algorithm thinks Liverpool is Salah Trent and jot which is interesting Diego jot has impressed me quite a lot during those first three weeks maybe less so last time out against Manchester United which was uh a bit disappointing as an owner of the man when Luis Diaz is shining off the left wing it makes it all the more painful but shter has still been very good we need to not forget that really he's going to be an early sub every game or not really early but around that 70 75 minute Mark for for Darwin Nunes with gakpo coming on off the left wing so he's still one that I think will come good and will get points it's just whether he will find the form that we've seen Salah and LU Diaz at the moment hitting so far over these first few game weeks but he has got returned uh and let's not you know say that he hasn't been missing chances as well he's had at least two from Trent over those first two game weeks that he could have put away and he could be on a higher amount of points than Lis Diaz and people would be debating that a lot more than maybe they are there's a bit of speculation around International Duty and all that stuff so maybe keep an eye on that if you're going for Liverpool options J and Diaz in particular um but yeah those are my two cents on the issues I think you can't really go wrong with or Diaz if one of those is your third Liverpool option alongside Trent and Salah I think you've got a very very good lineup there and then we've got e and Morgan Rogers as the other two midfielders I knew e would come good I said it last game week I'll say it again he's going to be a fantastic FPL pick over the course of this season he got extremely unlucky over the first two game weeks I can't believe anyone sold him let alone the fact that he got a price drop uh and lo and behold he came good in game week three against Chelsea he was a fantastic pick from the start he's got Leicester at home up next I don't really think it matters too much who Crystal Palace are playing if they're going to score goals and as is going to be involved in a hell of a lot of them and then Morgan Rogers who is kind of Yet to Come good but has been putting up chances for OE Watkins on an absolute plate uh he's going to be the best option at kind of 5.5 or 5.4 million and below that you can go for and so picking him up for ason vill's fixure run seems a bit of a no-brainer up front we're going to see erling harand come into the team and Kai H as the second forward which is very very interesting we got vet down there on the bench as well who will come in for weeks where brenford aren't playing Manchester City and presumably Lucin or Lewis or Mitchell whichever one fix to base will drop down onto the bench so I quite like the look of that front seven I'm a big fan indeed surprising to go for vissa over embo is not something you see the algorithm team do too much um but yeah Kai havs is a very very good pick and one that I quite back as you know sort of cover for that Arsenal forward line uh at least up until gameweek six where they fixes turn a little bit for the better and he can consider maybe moving in someone like a sacker or maybe a defensive option then so let's have a look at my team and how it Compares I'm aware this video is already over 11 minutes long so let's make sure we have a look at my team as well all [Music] briefly okay so here is my side it doesn't look that similar at all really I've made one big sacrifice in this team that I don't like making and it's Trent down to Robertson to save a million and I did need this million to get in the other attackers that I wanted and I know I've said a lot about Trent attacking data being very impressive but Robertson's look decent as well both of them seem to be getting subbed off uh at varying points in the game I think Connor Bradley is one that they're going to want to give more minutes to and hence Trent is more likely to be subbed earlier and so on the one hand you might get clean sheets that again might get wiped out in that maybe 10 minute spell between where Trent and Robertson get subbed off at Max but on the other hand you've got more potential for attacking returns with Trent on the pitch for more minute so that's what you're going to want as a Trent owner and we're not really seeing him get 90 so far this season I think that's going to be something that continues dare I say uh no matter how many stops Trent decides to throw and so I'm not seeing the upside there as much as maybe he would have in previous years I know Trent can easily get returns maybe even two uh in the first 70 minutes of a match but for me I just think that million does make a big difference to the rest of the side so I've decided to go with Robo over Trent I've still with Rico Lewis for me reasons mentioned prior I've gone with Robinson uh who is a player a big advocate for since game week one and then Davis of ipswitch on the bench who's got great attacking data has been playing very far forward very Advanced one that was talked about a lot in preseason was just not picked by anyone basically due to IPS which's first two opening games where you weren't going to be able to start him against Liverpool and Man City and then muscara as a 4.0 mil Defender I've gone with reyer in goal as my 5.5 mil keeper of choice now you could go with Allison in this side however I want to leave that third Liverpool slot open for if you know they are scoring so many goals that it seems inevitable to want a triple up uh on the Reds I've gone with Ry for now just to carry him into that good fixture run that starts game week six as I think that from there on out Arsenal are going to keep a fair fair amount of clean sheets and even in these next two games could be a clean sheet or two in it for them they have historically done very well even in big matches where they tend to play a little bit more off the off the front foot kind of on the back foot shut up shop and defend very very well Arsenal in my view at least last season the Midfield looks pretty similar three of the same Assets in here and then I've got seeno and mumo as my kind of twoos to complete my five uh seeno granted Bournemouth have tricky fixtures over the next two as well and this is another reason why I'm hesitant to use my own wild card and buo has Man City Zeno has Chelsea up next I think Zeno's got then got a tricky fixture next game week too but I think these are two players who are going to get 90 minutes for their side every week seeno likely to be on penalties maybe Evan nson who's coming could be on them and bumo we know for short is definitely on penalties and it's the same kind of principle with a where you're looking for a player who's a bit of a Talisman in their team involved in a lot of the play could or is on penalties uh and is just involved in an awful lot is going to get 90 minutes as said so yeah that's my justification behind going for those three and then up front we've got another penal penalty taker in ja Pedro have havs as well I think for reasons I've mentioned prior and then earling Harlen so you're going to be rotating that front eight again uh in this team with Davis Lewis and Robinson rotating in the defense and yeah that's going to about wrap up my Wild Card draft and what I'm looking at going for currently so let me know Down Below in the comments guys do you think my team is better or do you think the algorithm wild our team is better I'm interested to know what you guys think down below as mentioned at the start of the video if you did enjoy then make sure to leave a thumbs up it really does help us out here at the channel and yeah other than that I'll wish you guys a good rest of your day take it easy and goodbye [Music],3553,hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix youtube channel my name is fpl phillips and its going to be a week of eddie versus the algorithm where this week during international break were taking a look at wild card drafts but once again its going to be the algorithm team up against my own personal wild card draft that i have put together and to be honest im very close to going for if one more injury or one thing goes wrong during the international break ive made an early transfer my own personal team which if it backfires then ill be hitting the wild card button ive put together their team that im cy on when i will hit the chip i know im losing out on a bit of money but that is the cost of what im going for as im not 100 certain on it but the algorithm has put together its own team using its calculated formulas and all that stuff im very excited to take a look at it hopefully you guys are two to help you with your own personal decision making over this game week for fpl i know the international break is boring but if you could drop a like on the video and subscribe down below if you want to stay tuned for more fpl content when the football does eventually return then make sure to do that would be much appreciated but without any further ado lets get into the video shall we and kick things off as always with the algorithm side so we have the algorithm lining up in a 442 for this game week and its not going to be doing that every week of course but for game we 4 its going to be in this formation andc things off with the goalkeeper between the sticks it is going to be dean henderson of crystal palace which i thought is an interesting shout the goalkeeper that i currently own and have been with the majority of his owners rather disappointed with however there is still good justification for him remaining one of the top 45m options hes nailed on keeper for aide that last season had very good defense hes a decent fixture in gw four or be it granted after that theres a bit of a mixed bundle however weve already seen in game week 3 and over the course of last season as well how clean sheets are going to be more difficult to come by this year and if youre going for a 45m option its going to be difficult to expect clean sheets what id be more disappointed with henderson is that him on an individual notes has been quite poor and i think that his xg prevented is not going to be great this year im not sure hes going to make an awful lot of saves i in general dont just rate him as a keeper so if it was sam johnston or someone else that i thought was maybe a bit more capable in goal then it might be a different story at crystal palace if i could back them to make saves someone like aeno in goal there would do well i think because be able to keep a lot shots out however henderson just hasnt shown that yet for me from what ive watched the crystal palace let me know if you think otherwise but hes just overall not impressed me on the eye ive not looked at a load of stats with him with regards to that and how he compares to the other 45s but id be more likely to jump on someone maybe just like a fleam i know hes got two tricky fixures coming up but if youre looking very long term with this wild card then you do have to look ahead of those next two game weeks and youre not going to want to be making a goalkeeper transfer thats one of the thats probably the position where you least want to use transfers after your wild card and so for me a set for g keeper is very important over 10 or 20 game weeks if you can look that far on a wild card so for me if youre going with a 45 you could probably look elsewhere from henderson there are some okay rotation options you can go for with him but 45 mil keeper rotation doesnt always work out well for i would just use 55m and go for a more expensive keeper in that bundle which ill explain when we have a look at my side why ive chosen to do that in defense im interested to see who is lining up in this back four we have trent alexander rold rico lewis mitchell and then lukin so some very differential picks in here a few that ive seen mentioned once or twice and then two very popular picks in fpl at the moment tren alexander arnold first and foremost is performing very well has the most has the best expected fpl data if you use the opto stats tool over on fantasy football fix he is top of that and quite some margin ahead of everyone else robertson his teammate only down in fourth and so trends attacking data is looking pretty good albeit he hasnt had those mega holes that will get everyone talking about him over these first few game weeks but i still think that he is a very capable option and one that its difficult to turn away from when liverpool especially are keeping clean sheets trent does start to be able to justify that seven million price tag last season he was what 8m liverpool werent keeping as many clean sheets this season its going to be looking a lot better for him i think its set up well for him to come through with some of those returns whil everyones in a bit of a scramble to maybe getting some of the big guns up front and in midfield maybe ch alexander arnold will come into his own over these next three or four games for liverpool which do look nice indeed so having an optimal liverpool triple up is probably something that a lot of managers are going to be looking at rico lewis is the one i want to discuss next one has had some controversy around him youve got other competitions starting up for man city and this is going to prove pivotal in the rico lose to barle whether or not he can prove himself for minutes in the premier league so youre see going to see mixed things i dont think anyone knows for sure even sources who are very you in the know at man city will find it difficult to predict this one and how its going to fit in with kyle walker all i can go off is my opinion based on what ive seen so far this season from pepep and experience of being trolled by him in the past but rico le has been trusted with a lot so far this season a lot more than weve seen in any previous campaign and its unsurprising hes a young player coming through and he has looked exceptional and if this is anything to go on i think that lewis is going to remain a very good option for the rest of the season hes already up at 46m and he looks very attacking when hes on the pitch everyones talking about how you vs tucking in rico lewis is the one advancing making those runs getting into those advanced areas where hes picking up some good underlying expected data hes already rattled the crossbar hes hes had a lot of chances and i think hes going to come good and to be honest at that price point for a man city defender i think its worth it where theres not too many other 45m options shining in defense right now if youve got the bench i think you can afford to take the punt and so this team presumably does have that was the other sides i think will have that as well i think rico lewis is worth a money personally and i would have him in on a wild card draft lets say that the other two of very interesting pick theres a double up on crystal palace defense with mitchell which i would definitely not be justifying based on what ive seen so far from them anyway he has been getting forward a lot mitchell i still dont think hes a better pick than muno all things considered and so im a bit confused as why hes in here he has been picked i think by the algorthm team once in the past so maybe theres a bit of a liking to him maybe hell come good in this leicester fixture but as mention there a bit of a mix bag for crystal palace up next so im interested by that pick and then luca dean at aston villa is interesting one as i have seen things from villa fans claiming that they want matson to start hes assigning that they spent 440m p on in the summer i assumed he was going to come in and be first choice at some point just didnt know when that point is would it be game week two would it be game we one but theyve waited at least three game weeks at aston villa and i think maybe game we four could be the one and either way i think youve just got a bit of a ticking time bomb with luca dean one that you maybe dont want if youve got other defenders like rico lewis in granted l in is a pretty cheap option hes on my however forever fpl trolls list and for that reason can never step foot anywhere near my team a total logic totally

as well in particular it just doesnt make too much sense to me and so for that reason i wouldnt be owning lucine right now in midfield were going to see muhammad salah e diego jot and then morgan rogers a midfield that i do like the look of i think salah is going to be on every wild card team i think if anyones going to choose to drop one of harland or salah most teams are choosing to drop earning harand right now which you def fixes and everything like that liverpool have a fantastic three games coming up and i think the optimal triple up therefore the algorithm thinks liverpool is

9,fantasyfootballfixYT,4nszN8HLqtI,"🔥 GW4 WILDCARD TEAM: Salah, Haaland &amp; Top Picks | Dominate Fantasy Premier League 24/25 | FPL TIPS",2024-09-05T10:00:04Z,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix YouTube video my name is FPL Nao and in today's video we are talking all things Wild Card going into game we four I want to look at the teams to Target in the upcoming game weeks the players that you need to buy and of course whether you should have Highland in Salah or no Highland in your ward team so as always if you look forward today's video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further Ado let's get into today's video [Music] so first up when you are building a wild card team in gameweek 4 I think it's really important to understand the teams to Target over a longer term perspective now of course this season is a little bit different because of course we can keep transfers during the wild card so if you're one of those lucky managers that is maybe not used to transfer right now but it's also wild carding in game week four you'd actually come into game week five with three transfers available which is completely different to what we have seen in previous Seasons so it means you could wild card in game week four but still almost do a mini Wild Card a few game weeks later to jump on a particular fixture swing and we need to talk about that in the fixtures on your screen now of course there are a few few big teams that are not included in this list we will go through those including Man City Liverpool Chelsea Fulham so we will touch on those as well as what you can see on your screens but game we four and isolation has been a popular time for managers to Wild Card for a few weeks now I think they've looked at this moment with a fixture swing for the likes of Brighton for Aston Villa even for Chelsea and felt like this is a great opportunity to jump on some of the players available now in terms of Brighton the upcoming two are great IP switch at home not enough Forest at home in game week five but after that Chelsea away Spurs at home Newcastle away even Liverpool away in gameweek 10 it really does feel like the sort of team that if you were to Wild Card in game week four you'd don't really be bringing in the value players L Pedro for the next two game weeks and then maybe have to build a team where you either rotate that player in and out of the team during that tough spell or you do a mini wild card with your team and then look to jump off those players Brighton do offer brilliant value and we'll touch on some of those players in this video but it's worth noting it is a very short window where based on the fixtures they're actually quite attractive in terms of ailla as well this is a great time to jump on them if you want to Everton wolves IPS which even Man United at home I would argue is a good fixture and bouth at home in game week nine Watkins of course has been little bit difficult to have any sort of confidence in because he's been substituted early and his replacement in John Duran's actually been stepping up which is a little bit of a concern if you are looking to bring in Watkins into your gameweek four Wild Card teams and importantly we do have the return of the champions league for Aston Villa what is that going to do with these Aston Villa players we don't really have the answer to that right right now especially someone like a Morgan Rogers who has been so good with minutes could we start to see a change in that in terms of the other teams right now it looks like a bit of a change for Arsenal if you were to walk card in game week four I do think there's an argument potentially to go without I think Spurs away is actually a fixture that probably looks tougher on paper than what it is but Spurs followed by Man City if you are going to go without Arsenal I think that's the time to do so however you will if your wild card in the game week four need to have a strategy in place that you can get an Arsenal player back in gameweek six because Leicester at home South HED at home even Bournemouth away in game week 8 feels like fix fixures that you absolutely need to have a piece of that Arsenal attack and maybe one of the Defenders so if you're going for the wild car 4 strategy please do make sure you take a look at game week six where the fixtures do swing because that is also the time where a lot of managers are going to plan to walk card so if you don't have a plan on how to jump on some of these play like an Arsenal asset which is going to go big we have to also remember as well Liverpool long-term are great just running through the fixtures not Forest at home Bournemouth at home in the next two wolves Crystal Palace even Chelsea's home if you're wild card in game week four Liverpool are absolutely essential you do need to double up on those man city as well the real tricky thing about Man City going into gameweek four is that in gameweek four and isolation they have a great fixture at home against brenford but then in game week five they have Arsenal and in game week six they have Newcastle game week seven onwards the fixtures are phenomenal so you're in a tricky spot if you walk Hard in game week four because I think the fixtures too good in this specific game week to say you need to move away from Man City however you could then transfer out one of those players in game we five for a couple of game weeks if you need to free up some funds the other team that we need to talk about right now is going to be somebody like a new Castle going in away againsts Wolves Away gets Fulham then Man City it is a time if you want to to move away from the players because the team haven't been great and also I would argue the players haven't been offering amazing value and if you were looking to maybe change it up in your team moving away from Newcastle isn't a terrible move so that's just a quick recap on the fixures let's take a look at some of these teams first up with a haland and Salah draft so first up as you can see I have built a team here which includes both Harland and mo Salah in it because I do think it is a viable strategy that managers do need to consider now I will put this out there this isn't completely locked in in terms of the players I wanted to more build this team with an idea on how you could actually structure your team and then we could have a look at the rest of it here so in terms of the team we have got 4.5 million goalkeeper at Henderson we've got cheap enablers in this in the shape of Rico Lewis and coner and then of course we've got Robertson at 6 million you can see on the bench we've also got Pedro por alongside Robinson so we have good options in defense here and I would even argue if you needed to free up some funds in this wild card team you could easily downgrade maybe Pedro porro to a 4.5 million and if you're sat there right now thinking Trent Alexander Arnold is absolutely essential you can then upgrade with that 1 million from Robertson to Alexander Arnold if you felt that was the way to go in terms of the Midfield you've got your premium in mosala but we can also if you wanted to have Cole Palmer in your team at 10.6 million it would mean though coming all the way down to the cheaper nebl midfielders in the shape of Smith row Rogers and E which I think all offer a fantastic value and I would say as well if you could go to Someone Like A seeno I do think longterm he is a brilliant option for your teams when to take a look at the fixtures for Balou they are a little bit indifferent however Chelsea at home I do not think is a terrible fixure Liverpool away you could easily stash him on the bench for that game week then Southampton at home followed by leester away if you're going to ward in game week four I actually do think Sano is being overlooked right now and I think his minutes are better than that of Smith row so I couldn't afford him in this team but if you can get him in because he has slightly increased in price I think Sano instead of Smith row is actually the more favorable pick but as you can see with this team here you can get Harland you can get Sher Pedro but we are put at a dead spot in that third forward in the shape of Stewart I personally don't think that the forwards are good enough in gameweek four onwards to justify go for a three forward draft I would much rather go for some premium midfielders in this team the great thing about Cole Palmer is you can have him for the next couple of game weeks and as I spoke about in gameweek six sacka all these players who are Arsenal have brilliant fixtures so what you could do in this game week then is then flip it do Cole Palmer to aaka in game week six and basically r with a structure of howand Salah and of course bico Saka and the problem with it if you were then to sell Highland you can't really go back to him easily that is the big problem the cheapest player is Watkins who is6 million cheaper then you're having to completely change the structure of your team to go back to him later down the line so look at this team right now I actually think it is quite attractive I think you've got the premiums in Salah and Palmer you've got er Howland up top yes you don't have a forward between Howland and Xiao Pedro but right now don't think there is one that is standing out as an obvious pick in your teams and I do think with a slight tweak in this team you could easily let's say downgrade pedroo to a 4.5 then upgrade Robertson to Trent and then if you wanted to do Smith row to seeno with those small tweaks in the team I think you're getting closer to an ideal wild card in gameweek four but it's worth noting I still think you need to have a plan in place for the fixture swing in game week six where you can get on those Aral players and that's why I think wild card in gameweek 4 is a little bit worrying for certain managers depending on their team but this is definitely viable let me know your thoughts in the comments we now need to come to a draft which is a little bit controversial and that is going to be a no earling Howland team so as I mentioned it is a little bit controversial going with no Highland in a wild card 14 because as I mentioned brenford at home in gameweek four would you be surprised if he was to get another hatrick in that game I don't think we would be at all however as I mentioned to you in game we five in game week six he does have trickier fixtures there's no denying that so the first thing you need to not is this team has no Highland however you absolutely need a plan in place for him in game week seven sorry in game week seven where he has Fulham at home wolves away and then Southampton at home I feel that's a very scary period to not have an ER in hland so if you got a wild card and G before without howand please do have a plan in place to get him back and that is why I've put OE Watkins in the team because at his price point it is a bit of an easier way to get to Harland if there ever was one the problem with Watkins of course he isn't delivering and also the minutes are a little bit of a concern with the Champions League coming up as well the fixures are great but I'm just a little bit worried that we could see continuously what can's being substituted 20 15 minutes before the end and that never was a a problem for Watkins before so I think Watkins is great but you do need to be concerned about that so what other tweaks do we have with this team well we can easily afford Trent but importantly we can also put another premium midfielder in this team I've currently got for Kevin De bruy mainly because in game week four at home against brenford it's just a scary fixture not to have any man city coverage and I do think Kevin De bruyne has been ticking over nicely the great thing about de bruyne as well he could be our cash cow to go to other directions if Phil foden finally gets fit we have an easy route to Phil foden in gameweek six if we wanted to for that man City team and if you want to go that Highland I think foden or de bruy need to be in your teams we've been able to actually upgrade the forward line as well Visa coming in at 6.1 million I think brenford are a brilliant investment however maybe a little bit later down the line the next two they have City and Spurs but then in game week six they have West Ham wolves Man United and IP switch so again those managers that are going to walk card in game week six are all going to jump on brenford you need to have a plan in place where you try and get on some brenford assets cu the fixures are fantastic with brenford you know if they're going to score it's going to be Visa or it's going to be uo contributing in that goal so with this team it feels a little bit more well balanced but of course you are missing one key player in the shape of erling Howland but if you are brave enough to do it we've seen in the past few game weeks that managers who are without Harland are still still finding ways to not only match but sometimes do better than those managers that have howand in it so don't be too scared to do it the one thing I will say is this 4.5 million goalkeeper at Henderson I'm still going for that route but you could easily if you free up some funds maybe invest the 1 million and go for a rare at Arsenal long-term perspective is probably a better pick so let me know your thoughts in the comments right now I think the general consensus is a gameweek four wild card is actually quite hard to build but if you've activated it I think this looks great but I think it's easier said than don't going without ear in the hland and I think naturally we're going to default to a Highland and Salah draft and then look to squeeze in some value picks alongside it so let me know your thoughts in the comments which draft did you prefer and of course if you enjoyed the video in general make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button we of course be dropping videos throughout International break so hit that notification Bell so you do not miss a thing take care have an amazing day and see you real soon cheers,2772,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is fpl nao and in todays video we are talking all things wild card going into game we four i want to look at the teams to target in the upcoming game weeks the players that you need to buy and of course whether you should have highland in salah or no highland in your ward team so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up when you are building a wild card team in gw 4 i think its important to understand the teams to target over a longer term perspective now of course this season is a little bit different because of course we can keep transfers during the wild card so if youre one of those lucky managers that is maybe not used to transfer right now but its also wild carding in game week four youd come into game week five with three transfers available which is completely different to what we have seen in previous seasons so it means you could wild card in game week four but still almost do a mini wild card a few game weeks later to jump on a particular fixture swing and we need to talk about that in the fixtures on your screen now of course there are a few big teams that are not included in this list we will go through those including man city liverpool chelsea fulham so we will touch on those as well as what you can see on your screens but game we four and isolation has been a popular time for managers to wild card for a few weeks now i think theyve looked at this moment with a fixture swing for the likes of brighton for aston villa even for chelsea and felt like this is a great opportunity to jump on some of the players available now in terms of brighton the upcoming two are great ip switch at home not enough forest at home in game week five but after that chelsea away spurs at home newcastle away even liverpool away in gw 10 it does feel like the team that if you were to wild card in game week four youd dont be bringing in the value players l pedro for the next two game weeks and then maybe have to build a team where you either rotate that player in and out of the team during that tough spell or you do a mini wild card with your team and then look to jump off those players brighton do offer brilliant value and well touch on some of those players in this video but its worth noting it is a very short window where based on the fixtures theyre quite attractive in terms of ailla as well this is a great time to jump on them if you want to everton wolves ips which even man united at home i would argue is a good fixture and bouth at home in game week nine watkins of course has been little bit difficult to have any confidence in because hes been substituted early and his replacement in john durans been stepping up which is a little bit of a concern if you are looking to bring in watkins into your gw four wild card teams and importantly we do have the return of the champions league for aston villa what is that going to do with these aston villa players we dont have the answer to that right now especially someone like a morgan rogers who has been so good with minutes could we start to see a change in that in terms of the other teams right now it looks like a bit of a change for arsenal if you were to walk card in game week four i do think theres an argument potentially to go without i think spurs away is a fixture that probably looks tougher on paper than what it is but spurs followed by man city if you are going to go without arsenal i think thats the time to do so however you will if your wild card in the game week four need to have a strategy in place that you can get an arsenal player back in gw six because leicester at home south hed at home even bournemouth away in game week 8 feels like fix fixures that you absolutely need to have a piece of that arsenal attack and maybe one of the defenders so if youre going for the wild car 4 strategy please do make sure you take a look at game week six where the fixtures do swing because that is also the time where a lot of managers are going to plan to walk card so if you dont have a plan on how to jump on some of these play like an arsenal asset which is going to go big we have to also remember as well liverpool longterm are great just running through the fixtures not forest at home bournemouth at home in the next two wolves crystal palace even chelseas home if youre wild card in game week four liverpool are absolutely essential you do need to double up on those man city as well the real tricky thing about man city going into gw four is that in gw four and isolation they have a great fixture at home against brenford but then in game week five they have arsenal and in game week six they have newcastle game week seven onwards the fixtures are phenomenal so youre in a tricky spot if you walk hard in game week four because i think the fixtures too good in this specific game week to say you need to move away from man city however you could then transfer out one of those players in game we five for a couple of game weeks if you need to free up some funds the other team that we need to talk about right now is going to be somebody like a new castle going in away againsts wolves away gets fulham then man city it is a time if you want to move away from the players because the team havent been great and also i would argue the players havent been offering amazing value and if you were looking to maybe change it up in your team moving away from newcastle isnt a terrible move so thats just a quick recap on the fixures lets take a look at some of these teams first up with a haland and salah draft so first up as you can see i have built a team here which includes both harland and mo salah in it because i do think it is a viable strategy that managers do need to consider now i will put this out there this isnt completely locked in terms of the players i wanted to more build this team with an idea on how you could structure your team and then we could have a look at the rest of it here so in terms of the team we have got 45m goalkeeper at henderson weve got cheap enablers in this in the shape of rico lewis and coner and then of course weve got robertson at 6m you can see on the bench weve also got pedro por alongside robinson so we have good options in defense here and i would even argue if you needed to free up some funds in this wild card team you could easily downgrade maybe pedro porro to a 45m and if youre sat there right now thinking trent alexander arnold is absolutely essential you can then upgrade with that 1m from robertson to alexander arnold if you felt that was the way to go in terms of the midfield youve got your premium in mosala but we can also if you wanted to have cole palmer in your team at 106m it would mean though coming all the way down to the cheaper nebl midfielders in the shape of smith row rogers and e which i think all offer a fantastic value and i would say as well if you could go to someone like a seeno i do think longterm he is a brilliant option for your teams when to take a look at the fixtures for balou they are a little bit indifferent however chelsea at home i do not think is a terrible fixure liverpool away you could easily stash him on the bench for that game week then southampton at home followed by leester away if youre going to ward in game week four i do think sano is being overlooked right now and i think his minutes are better than that of smith row so i couldnt afford him in this team but if you can get him in because he has slightly increased in price i think sano instead of smith row is the more favorable pick but as you can see with this team here you can get harland you can get sher pedro but we are put at a dead spot in that third forward in the shape of stewart i personally dont think that the forwards are good enough in gw four onwards to justify go for a three forward draft i would much rather go for some premium midfielders in this team the great thing about cole palmer is you can have him for the next couple of game weeks and as i spoke about in gw six sacka all these players who are arsenal have brilliant fixtures so what you could do in this game week then is then flip it do cole palmer to aaka in game week six and r with a structure of howand salah and of course bico saka and the problem with it if you were then to sell highland you cant go back to him easily that is the big problem the cheapest player is watkins who is6 million cheaper then youre having to completely change the structure of your team to go back to him later down the line so look at this team right now i think it is quite attractive i think youve got the premiums in salah and palmer youve got er howland up top yes you dont have a forward between howland and xiao pedro but right now dont think there is one that is standing out as an obvious pick in your teams and i do think with a slight tweak in this team you could

12,FFScout_,jfq0eHtXsOQ,FPL DEADLINE DILEMMAS GW4! 💥 | FINAL THOUGHTS! | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25,2024-09-13T09:53:21Z,[Music] [Applause] Hello everybody welcome back to deadline dilemas this is press and I'm joined as usual by my good friend mo mo how are you doing I'm good thank you very much how are you press I'm doing all right I enjoyed the international break a little bit I mean you miss the football but you also like a nice quiet weekend and it's not just about the quiet okay it's you get bored but you also there's no pain like nothing can ruin my mood this that that that part of the thing I don't I don't mind it you know uh what about you how was your how was your International break very good I think it was a nice break especially for me well I was going to wear my Liverpool shirt price but I thought I'd leave it there's no need for that we ended got my man united kit my third kit so we can we can uh team up next weekend next week possibly but we we went into the international break while I went into the international break pretty okay we'll talk about FB in a bit more detail but just in football in general Liverpool three games undefeated no goals conceded and to beat our Rivals United I was I was over the moon so I went into the international bre of a smile friend okay no it's good times man I mean uh when David Moyes joined man united we were all very happy for the first couple of weeks as well um it's only after things go wrong then you start missing the Messiah uh when we started missing Sir Alex so look hopefully it works out for you guys but I would want Liverpool fans not to get too excited no no you're right I agree with you I'm not getting too C away I thought I just mentioned it cuz I know you're a United fan but you are true it's threee games it it don't mean nothing and three really reasonably easy games and again I'm dissing man united again but your start everybody knew your start was the best so the test will come when you play Arsenal and when you play Man City yeah yeah totally agree so how do we uh how do we start this week should we start with Rob T actually I want to start with your last week's decision because on Deadline dilemas you know you were like oh I've done this move I'm not sure was it the right move but you backed yourself you got jao Pedro you started jao Pedro against Arsenal and he rewarded you and now you've been tracking his flights so you're one of us yeah no honestly it was a I felt that it was a bit of a it was a frowned upon move because I went everyone was going to go him this week but I thought no I'm going to go week early I didn't want to wait even though it was against Arsenal for I'll try my luck and I'll do it and like he said it paid off for me press I was really that made my weekend if I'm honest of you because against Arsenal you don't really get sniff for him to get that rebound and to finish it I was like okay this is not not too bad and it means I'm a week ahead it's a move I don't need to consider this week and as you know pres I've started with a lot of fires in my team so I need these transfers I was really happy with that yeah no well played well played and look I always like a long-term move paying off you know like some people will go for instant gratification and pick a player that has a b great fixture this week but then you know not so great after and then they put too much hopes and expectations on that player when they picked them in the on the opposite sense you kind of got a player who you wanted long term if be blanked into against Arsenal so be it now you know that was not the fixture you got him for so the points become a bonus it actually feels even better it does it really is it's one of the nicest feeling in FBO because it's like a week You' done early with the odds realistically against it but it's still paid off and now I thought I can just forget about that this week because he's one of the hot properties this this this upcoming game which we're going to talk about in a bit more detail and I've already got him so now I could focus my transfer which in a minute when we look at my team I I had the opportunity I had money in the bank obviously from removing an to Pedro and I had I could you know I could improve other places which which you know I had a lot of issues to sort so yeah Cho about that let's open your team let's go through it uh we can be basically after or during the thing we can switch to Rob T's stuff as well as we're talking about other stuff but why don't you read it out so Henderson in goal finally a return I mean there was a debate whether four point is a return Prize or not what's your what's your opinion four point was not a return look how strict you are Lords were saying four points is a return some are saying is not a return for keeper safe Point return for keeper is a is a clean sheet or a rare assist fair but I mean we're so desperate for goalkeeper points desperate Four Points was welcome let's say I was about to say let's let's take that so he outscored Rya he outscored fleen he outscored um arola so all all the big guys so you know only one clean sheet last week which was Al Liverpool yeah so that's an inter yeah so and then um Trent who's been outstanding and if I'm honest with you he's returned in three game weeks but we've been cheated if I'm if I'm totally honest with you we should have two assists and a goal so it told you we're missing at least 20 points from from Trent if I'm honest with you pres but he's been he's been great no issues with him Robinson was the star like he he performed for me last week as well and he has to start this game week because uh look at my bench and then kza now is he fit I don't know if you know any more updated information as far as I'm concern I've not heard anything ke I mean in in our case you have kza I have conza yeah if you have a good first bench it doesn't matter and and you know basically um it already after the match I think the post match uh the manager said he was he looked fine so I'm not expecting anything but if he misses out it's not the end of the world like it's not yeah I mean his ceiling is not exactly massive it's not like Tren missing out you know no no that would be scary so that's the defense that's the back four and then in Midfield we've got Bruno Fernandez now this is a pivotal game week I've held him for the first three game weeks PR he's been one of the high Underachievers at 1.3 XG and still nothing and then I have to sit and watch in international break him displaying how good he is which we all know he's a good player but unfortunately at United they just don't have the players who can finish their chances and that's a big problem but against Southampton this must be the one that there's a return there for me price it's got to be it really has to be yeah yep I can see it I can see it uh I mean this is the game so I I completely agree with you people will call him a troll people will call him like you know man united a rubbish but you're right he has underperformed a lot like he should have got a couple of assists at least one return and then that full game when he had those two big chances so it's it's been unlucky but you know it is a desperate situation because he's going to price drop again if you he is going to drop again yeah I mean PR price I've lost I've lost money all over the place I'm listen this I'm in trouble here when it comes to money but uh there not much I could do I've tried to sell some of the players how did you pick this Bunch where Bruno is dropping you had unu you had sank to be fair but isack K Quanza K Quanza man you picked them all I picked every one of them yeah I'm not when are you wild carding so we can avoid your players yeah I think well maybe game week six you know you better be careful because I know you're hot on that but I was actually close to Wild Card in even this International break press I've managed to hold off I was considering it you know I was thinking maybe after this chat maybe you'll reconsider let's see I might yeah yeah I'm I'm willing I'm willing to go for it I'm not too scared long time ago I'd always keep it to very you know closer to Christmas but now no if if might I think if kza was like fully injured confirmed out and I looks I've got Hall and uh Harwood on the bench I'm close you know let's say I hear you I hear you I hear I am close you what move have you made so you said you got so eza's come in for inuko as you can see my new sign in is beside Bruno Fernandez right there so he's coming to the team he's a he's a pick up yeah it's a big upgrade there really excited about him he's shot volume the chances he's creating he's been unfortunate people started a season of impress game week one and two and they got frustrated so they flogged him so I got him for a bit of a a bargain which is good considering he's 6.9 but considering I've lost so much money this is really good so I'm really happy about him and it's a lovely fixture as well ler he's got two home games which is big but I'm going to make a case for asking you why you didn't go Roger and not because Rogers is better than e because now I feel you've blocked yourself off Salah in one move right next week would I been able to go there I'm trying I've got 1.9 I think in the bank would I have done that uh well if you went Rogers who's five yeah a is 6.9 so that's another 1.8 million because he's I think Rogers is now 5.1 so 1.8 plus 1.9 that's 3.7 Bruno is 8.4 yeah so that would be 12.1 actually you wouldn't get I wouldn't have been yeah I thought I5 short yeah it was it was a teaser I thought I had a little look but yeah it wouldn't have been there but I'm willing to if I feel the the urge to get Sala now I'm willing to take a minus four and find the money somewhere else it's just next week actually you don't need like people are getting Salah as if like it's impossible to go without Salah I mean it's fine it's just like it's okay to go without Holland the issue is next week obviously Holland plays Arsenal so who would you Captain next week let's say you couldn't go Salah you just go captain no I could go J Captain I could possibly go there I wouldn't be scared to go there I'm trying to think who my I did have Alternatives actually let me have a look to see I'm just having a look right now on my team who would I go it have to be Liverpool player versus Bourn Trent you could do Trent Trent I'm never the biggest fan of uh or you could just go H in man it's not the end of the world yeah I mean that could be a week I risk it you know I do something I do something different there maybe even Pedro is it against Forest Something Something Different yeah that's a week I could gamble but I might still bring him in press I'm not as scared I think as everyone else's I'm not going to break my team and panicked for the F I'm not I'm not going you have to just consider your parts and that's that's all I was talking about would have allowed a Bruno to Salah then I would have done that but it doesn't so it's fine I think a is a fantastic pick this week yeah Rogers yeah wrong with him I really like him he's it was between you know the three players I had PR that I considered it was ezar Rogers and seeno yeah they're the three I actually considered soo's putting up the numbers it seems that changed man to be honest the shot volume and the big chances he's take you know having whatever that continues is a separate story but in the first game week first three game weeks yeah looks really really good so I did consider him I did consider Rogers but I thought I have to get him into my team as even though against the Chelsea um he you know he bailed him out there but the game weeks before he was still getting the shots and getting into positions he was unlucky remember he scored that goal and it was this allowed yes wrongly in game week two so it could have been different and yeah it could have been 7.1 million so you know as FPL managers we can be fickle at times one you know ruthless that removes I'm more than happy with him beside him I've got um Anthony Gordon he's still here now I know a lot of people have gone cold on the Newcastle assets which is understandable they've not been that good especially performance- wise I would say they've been very good in that they haven't lost they've won two and drawn one in poor performances that's normally Elite attributes if I'm honest with you that's what we associate if Arsenal do it we say look at them Premier League you've seen the games no like I have watched the games I have yeah yeah but in fact I think I've seen all their first three games what I mean is we've seen it like the performance isn't at that same level no but then the point I'm getting at is when you're still getting the wins that it can believe you it can still give you the confidence where a performance could come up so against wolves against wolves it's normally the opposite if you're performing amazing and you're not winning games like I'd say maybe Spurs are not performing amazing but against Newcastle Spurs are very good and then they lost it's harder for them to put in a performance this week because it's on their head like we played really good and we still lost like what's happening we're Newcastle we're not even we haven't even turned up yet and we're beating teams so that's a powerful thing to have so that could work in the favor I'm I'm this is what I'm telling myself as as a triple Newcastle oh fair enough I'm hoping against wolves and maybe the narrative is different this season last last season he couldn't he was indestructible at home games and pour away this season he's had two home games two blanks and one away game and he scored so if he scores against wolves you never know press yeah no no I I'm I'm with you like I when we'll come to my team I I'll tell you I have a free transfer left I have money in the bank for isack to Watkins but I won't do it because I think isack is still a good shout and there's other issues with Watkins like similarly for gner unless you find an upgrade that is so far better yeah um then I think he's he's an okay hold like there's no issue with holding Gordon totally agree so he's starting for me you know what actually we'll have this conversation now there was one stage I was considering Gordon versus Smith R who's first on my bench but then Smith rolls minutes PR just put me off it he's been 60 to 70 minutes where at least Gordon maybe the performances not being great but 90 minutes the probability is higher isn't there and set pieces like without trip here he's taking corners free kick so that's also one to watch like Sher will be back so you have another tall guy in addition to burn so yeah I think it's it's worth it I'd play Gordon over Smith R definitely yeah that's my choice and actually You' said sh will be back if he comes into the team do you think that's associated with Hall starting or do you think that's completely irrelevant Hall lost his plays against Southampton he didn't have a great game even though they won one nil he could start it's not like he can't start in fact U I would actually put him above uh just you know herwood Bell is just as a punt in case kza doesn't start but I just think with Hall the problem is you're not sure you're not sure which game Kelly starts which is very strange like Kelly starting over Hall but Hall has been his performances have been up and down so yeah you don't want to go there like there's so many good 4.5 Defenders that you don't want to chance it like so I think in the bench you can chance it but as a starter you just can't go there yeah that's the reason I was asking you because if I thought he would start I'd actually consider it you know just for the potentially I prefer him than than cona and Harwood if I thought he was starting but I agree that that's too much of a risk but I will move him on the bench but cona you say like I would be happy starting like if you go to Rob's chart if you look at the clean sheet odds um like this week like last week was the complete opposite to this week where last week there were no clean sheets right there was only one team above 40% and I think what was it Arsenal and they didn't keep a clean sheet this we you have a ton of teams like Villa is 40% clean sheet odds which is very good Brighton 42% Man City 46 Liverpool 46 these are good clean sheet shots even Crystal Palace at 36 isn't bad so I think these are teams that like for me a 40% of coner versus where is Newcastle 24% I would start kza even if Hall was starting it's just not the most but I agree with you yeah that's why he in my starting team and I must remind you per remember when we discussed the Arsenal V Brighton and we saw the clean sheet Al I did say to you I wasn't comfortable with those statistics I had a feeling Brighton they're front four yeah but did you see the first until the red card like I know I know but even then I think when I look at a team like Brighton frf for I do like they will struggle not to get a goal in a game on the this was the theory I mean but you know same story for Aston Villa like Aston Villa should have scored against Arsenal as well so like in the end it evened out where Arsenal kept sheets in the first three games um where you know maybe in the Villa game they shouldn't have maybe in the Brighton game if there wasn't a red card they could have but I'm with you like these there's a lot of good attacking teams in the league at the moment and it's very hard to you know nail down unless it's an Arsenal defense maybe you can say a guardio maybe a Trent and and Robertson is very hard to get a clean sheet expect why is why have the clean sheets gone I mean to have one clean sheet last week but last week was predictable the games were tough the matchups were tough yeah but still it does seem like you don't normally I don't know is the Prem going down that route where I just think the manager mindsets have changed like when we started football like 20 years ago or whatever I'm not sort of guessing your age or whatever but 20 25 years ago you used to have at least six to eight managers that would just set up to defend against the big teams they would do nothing else but just sit back long balls sit back long balls those are basically games where they're hoping for a nil nil or a game goal of the counter now you have teams like Crystal Palace Brighton um Villa I mean Villa is better than them Bournemouth West Ham loads those teams I know what you mean yeah they back themselves basically to win yeah they do I would say these are good managers which play in a system and they're not scared to to have the ball to pass through the back to you know yeah sometimes they sit back but uh the league has changed it is no no I totally agree with you totally agree with you let me go back to my team right so last name on Midfield is J being happy with him it's the first game he didn't return against the United 3-0 it's a shame because it was a pretty comfortable game in the end but um he did come off early which is something we're starting to notice with slot it's going to be interesting to see when the Champions League kicks in is he going to go down the Realms where he mixes the minutes between both tournaments or does he start playing a Prem team and almost you see a core Prem team and then a champions league if that makes sense that's what I want to watch so that's going to be quite interesting especially when I eventually want to say if I want to get Triple Liverpool that's going to be interesting because you might not want to go Diaz you might prefer Robo yeah so I had a couple of questions to you as a Liverpool fan actually uh you didn't consider instead of e going Diaz because there's a lot of like Diaz fever in terms of how he's looking his positioning how he's like more advanced with slot and the way they're passing the ball and getting him behind the lines anything there that did you consider that I did consider it but I think I did consider it but I wasn't 100% sure on my Liverpool triple so I've already got J and uh you'd get locked out of Salah i' get locked out of Salah so that's what put me off him Diaz at the moment statist all these stats are very good performances on your eyes playing very good if if anything when he came in I did read the article but I wasn't sure saying that Diaz was like almost he type of Winger and it's proven to be he's he's one of the players I think him and graen bur have flourished the most under slot so it's a big big positive and I've got no issues of people Diaz I think he's a good pick does he become a casual e With Champions League in the league I'm I'm not quite sure that's an unknown we're going to see very soon in the upcoming weeks but yeah I think ezza for me and maybe because the start I've had press where we spoke about minute ago I've picked all of those players that have kind of some of them unlucky some of them maybe not great picks maybe I wanted I'm scared to almost say on the the the Pod that I wanted a certainty and ezza is like he's the main guy there like there Undisputed no one can talk to him unless he's injured he's playing so that's I think I I wanted a bit more of those in my team before I start yeah not saying Diaz isn't a certainty by the way yeah I know I I hear you so second question on J um of course apart from reduced minutes he was at the international break whereas Darwin Nunes was sitting at home um because he was banned from Uruguay so any any concerns there on J starting this week I don't think so you know I'm I'm I'm gonna say this from from what I've seen since slot I was about to say clot since slot's bought in uh this front free one of the reasons I think Diaz has improved a lot I think when Nunes plays he's he's very erratic Nunes is the type of player he wanted to touch the ball last like running onto it and hitting it he's not really the type of player when he gets the ball in too much time he's almost a danger and I think Diaz at times if I'm honest with you last season is very frustrating within the Liverpool Community Lords worth if he didn't start a season like this Lords of Liverpool fans might not admit it they wanted him gone they would have taken because he was very frustrating his decision making was poor I think Salah obviously is an elite player game changer but the introduction of J that calmness has improved Diaz and I'm not sure if he's going to break that front free up especially as we' started the season so well so yeah I think at the moment I still think J yeah plays okay good yeah I think Nunes will have to wait his chance and there will be chances we've seen J's injury record and the games are going to come like thick and fast now so he will get minutes you've seen both F Diaz and J been coming off around the 70th minute for those two so yeah I don't think he's going to switch it now pres I'm comfortable J to starting yeah okay okay sounds good um and then your forward line so Pedro who came in last week like we discussed very fortunate there so I was happy about that harand who at the moment is making a mockery of the Premier League press I mean we've seen we've been around to see pure Elite Strikers but this is becoming comical now like if he gets a hattick of hat tricks I mean I'm not quite sure what what what we can say about this guy's unreal so he's the captain so I didn't even consider no one else this week normally I do like to have a little look I'm not not doing that at all and beside him is Isaac who I'm actually very excited to own this week BR because Vice Captain I'd Vice Captain is man no no I I fancy he's you know what maybe I rate him you know I do you saw his little interview he done after International game yeah he is the type of player he's got that arrogance I really like in a football player he knows he's he's good and Elite the Wolves fixure doesn't scare me that much I know the formation change has been discussed and after that Chelsea battering they're gonna have to fix up a little bit but N I think you got is like I really like him I'll keep the the Vice Captain there I fanc him for a goal I'm actually quite happy people have done me a bit of a favor that they've moved away from him when I saw him being sold PR I was like oh thank God this is so good news because I think he's an excellent like pick I much prefer him than Watkins my goodness yeah I mean if if if isak plays 90 minutes Watkins plays 60 again I definitely do like he's on pens Watkins we're not sure like unlikely to be on pens um if you look at actually the again the Rob T chart with the strikers um the one before this yep so if you look at it esack is on 0.59 goals expected goals Watkins is exactly the same and this assumes a full game so if Watkins plays fewer than 90 minutes then Watkins is lower than than esack actually this week so look at J man he's higher than both of them that doesn't that's that is incredible it's it's the opposition isn't it it switch but I will say this something's not right with Watkins like I'm not quite sure maybe I'm just jumping on because he's not had an incredible start like he did last season but very weird for the main dude to be playing those 60 minutes he's like their Sala press I can understand what we said about jotter and Diaz you've got gak PA Nunes but Watkins that that I mean Duran he might be good but Watkins is their main dude so to see him coming off something's definitely not not right especially when he hasn't got a goal you'd think you'd leave him on to 90 minutes to get that off his shoulders because the more games that goes the more that's going to pay on his mind I'll tell you that now it's going to get more and more difficult well we now know a little bit more right I mean uh initially he had not played a single minute of preseason yeah so the first two games when he came off early everyone said yeah fine he's just getting up to speed right I mean you when you start preseason games nobody plays 90 minutes day one so he was basically getting up to speed then game week three unry tells us oh he's actually carrying some injury or he was carrying an injury when he was coming back and then he withdraws from England and then now he's not seen in training like I think he'll start again but his minutes are still impacted like you're not expecting 90 minutes not when they have U this midweek game which is by the way a way to young boys you know you know young boys the Swiss Club they have that artificial pitch they play on astral turf yeah they play on Astro yeah that's like a bigger issue like you know this this year's champions league and by the way people who didn't check it out last week uh last to last week when we we did this video we talked about the new Champions League format and uh this every game matters like the seeding will matter so you know you you might just see fewer minutes for Watkins or you might see a lot of minutes and we look like idiots when he scores his brace home to Everton so but that's part of it I I mean I think I don't think isak to Watkins is a desperate move you need to make case in point I can't I can do it for free and I'm not doing it yeah now I prefer isak um just com back to my team I prefer isak this we I I really like him and even with newcastle's performances and it's an away fixture and it's against wolves nah he's one of the players I looked him you know I've got loads of issues but he's one of the players I didn't see like worrying me at all if I'm honest with you I mean you've got a house on fire so yeah the the the the noisy the noisy door can actually wait I've started to slowly get rid of those though so the free pulling the free transfers I've used you know this week's transfer was so satisfying I actually poured myself honestly a little drink to celebrate and cuu leaving my team I was like ah this is so good it was because he's just been in my team for he went down to 6.2 I mean come on and the irony is I saw what you said on on X whatever it's called these days what this is the game week where he plays him and Quanza I was just saying with Europe starting you know a lot a lot of clubs will almost like reset and so if that happens PR I don't know I won't I won't be able to handle that ifu starts he now that we know that he barely plays 60 Minutes doesn't make him a great pick like he's still a bad he's still not a great pick if he's not going to be First Choice starting most games because that's what you need from a 6.5 because his competition you know that the guys even at the 1 million below like Min seeno they're starting games they're doing well in those games so why would you need to go there totally agree and just to finish off from all my team PR I've got on the bench Matthews who doesn't even play Smith roll Howard and Hall which discuss I might swap the order around there but that that's me for this week I think I'm pretty locked off Captain Captain Vice Captain I've got 1.9 million in the bank PRS that's I just checked now so don't for next week not quite sure what I'm going to do yet I know a move for you next week I know a move for you next yeah let me hear it what what are you thinking Bruno toon Captain who the Spurs got next week home to brenford yeah that's a good that's that's a good move yeah espe if I'm wild card in six that's the sort of move I'll do yeah yeah that's a good you need a captain next week like unless you're happy to do jot or you could just do Bruno to Diaz like if next week you're thinking okay or or even you know Smith row to uh to Diaz and and then you have your captaining those two is very similar the minutes I did say gakpo Nunes they're both excellent uh backups they could play from 70 minutes ideally when you Captain you do want your captain to be a 90 minute and and ideally on pens so you can get lucky so you can Jam one I totally agree with you that's why you suggested EA which is fair to be honest maybe I shouldn't discount it that easily and it's a good fixture leester well as Vice cap but then isak is also on pen so it's not between isak and a like you can see that Roby chart like isak is just slightly higher than e but then that's not that's his expected goals uh because e will get more points if it's a clean sheet and if he scores it's it's Five Points so expected points I would say a is higher than isack this week um so that's and E's having the shot volume he's like every 18 minute he's popping off a shot as well he's hid and like and remember every time he has a short on target positive BPS 15 15 goal attempts as well he's so high up there when I'm looking at the stats right now like five chances created as well he's ticking yeah nah good good so before I go to my team I'm going to ask you this question because everybody is right now in a mild Panic not mild Panic actually just a mild concern is how I would put it um is basically harand not training yesterday now today he was training uh it's been confirmed he was training he's apparently had a private um you know somebody passed away who's who's a mentor to him or something or a friend and basically the Daily Mail which nobody should believe but uh but they have said oh you know he may be allowed compassionately of course they know what they're doing you know people will click the article to see or is he going to miss game week 4 uh I can can say with quite some conviction that he will play he played when his grandma passed away last year if you remember I do remember so it just gives people a little bit of a mild Panic now you have got Smith on your team I don't think you need to bother if he's if he's missing or misses out in the end but any other views like anything different to what I said N I wouldn't I I think it sounds almost harsh saying it a family member pass in a way but I think he wants that hat-trick of hat-tricks that I can't see I can't look past that the way the type the person he is well in fact you don't get to that level when you don't hunt down every Target like Salah Salah every time I see him interviewed he knows every goal every statistic everything he'll be playing PR they those type of players their machines they they count their goals in in in training it's those dudes yeah they're not he's you see that Ronaldo interview that I I'm G to score a thousand goals and I've got a video of every single goal I scored like what what kind of a it maybe takes that mentality to basically you can't get like that press if you're one of those people that are happy that your team wins and you've just got an assist Ronaldo and Messi and and them guys are in the Chang of room crying that's not good enough they they need to Winning is a bonus they need to score their goals they like that and that's how it works so Holland for me is playing this game week and two goals minimum like simple as that like it like okay let's go to my team let's go all right so actually despite like all the different parts we've taken like I started with two premiums you started with just Holland and and no like mid premium yeah we are actually converging to quite an extent actually so I've got the same keeper as you Henderson I've got two same Defenders as you Trent and kza I could have had Robinson as well but I did Hall to dunk as an Ultra Luxury transfer like I was why why dunk press tell me please why it's like almost like why dunk the two is it just because go on the next two fixtures they're top of the ticker home to Forest Home towi and there is no other Defender that has the same clean sheet odds for 4.5 million that I could have afforded for uh for this guy I did consider Rico Lewis but then Rico Lewis plays Arsenal so even though I would have got a game out of him this week next week I'd have had to play Robinson who's home to Newcastle who's fine like I think it's okay fixture but with dun's two fixtures I was like okay I can just play dunk in the next two it's you know we are in different paths at the moment I had three free transfers not a sing single price drop I know that's unreal that is you know so I I basically had two guys dropping three guys dropping on the international break Sunday night which was Gordon Hall and esac and I was like you know what I'll sell Gordon for E because that I wanted to do anyway yeah you have your eyes on that for some time yeah and then I'll do Hall to dunk because that's a super luxury move but I get a little bit of higher clean sheet odds I'm just playing a little bit of a little bit of a higher upside game um and uh and I'll keep isak because I still think isak is good so I did two free transfers dunk for Hall and E for Gordon and so reading out my team so so then I've got jot who you have e who you have I've got Salah and Rogers instead of basically you're Bruno and Gordon so it's not like too different like I'm not captaining any of them so um you know fair enough and our stri dunk instead of my conser instead of your Robinson yeah sorry of course yeah yeah so so that's it and our forward line is the same Xiao Pedro harand isach that was my forward line from gimic one so that's that's the team captain is Holland and uh you know the beautiful thing about gimi four and five you have home and away games in pairs have you noticed that yeah like uh you know Liverpool have two home games four and five Villa have two home games four and five Palace as well two home games four and Brighton have two home games four and five Aston Villa have two home games four and five so basically that's my team and it's a good team it's a good you're in a good place you're like you said game from game week one I won't say youve cruised it but things have gone your way quite well especially like you said with injuries and the players not dropping in prices and stuff you've done really well you you picked the thing that made immediate sense to me was especially for someone like me who went quite aggressive over a rubbish bench I loved your triple Liverpool how I didn't do that as well with Salah I tried to almost like maximize my money and it sort of backfired like you said I had loads of medium priced midfielders I thought I could it's not backfired it's just that you gotten unlucky like the reason why a lot of people are now converging towards oh let's have two premiums and why it looked absolutely stupid in game week one is because a lot of people said hey what about Watkins what about Bruno Fernandez what about odard but they've all done [ __ ] so why people say oh actually yeah we should have got Salah and Holland but no that's not true like Salah could have blanked one game Bruno gets a brace or Watkins starts to look really amazing yeah and suddenly you feel like oh i' I've put all my money on two players and a confidence prize in the the enablers Mina Rogers Like A Smith Ro there's quite a lot of them popping up now Pedro well you started off Pedro but there's a good amount of players wellick would there's good cheap players that allows you to move the into Midfield or where the premiums are so yeah it makes sense now in iight obviously it seems straightforward but in game week one I had a different Vision but I like your team I think you're you're set comfortably to be honest youve you've got already next weeks and the week after captains sorted as well are you you're still set on Wild Card six per is that like lck you're not really there's nothing dependent nothing that can happen in gameweek four and five that changes your mind uh the only thing that can happen is tomorrow Holland is out and I'll wild card oh you would if you found out you play the Wild I I'll get my three free transfers back I'll play the Wild Card Highland L team and I go from there so like it it it's this is why wild card is not such a big deal this year yeah like doing a wild card now and carrying free three free transfers after it it's actually pretty cool and that wild card without Holland because Holland is out would make would make some sense because then you don't need Holland for for Arsenal you don't need him for away to Man City I would probably think about a while card which has Palmer and and Salah and no Holland it would have Watkins um maybe a HTS but then there's some un Arsenal uncertainty I was gonna say that that it wouldn't that interrupts the Watkins uncertainty and the Arsenal uncertainty odard is so key he's like an elite player yeah they're gonna struggle without him I don't care how good Arsenal are he is and if he's missing some that's another one that reports are bit random I read that it could be two months read it could be three weeks I'm not quite sure three weeks three weeks is the consensus but yeah apparently there's too much swelling for the MRI so I don't know how people are coming up with three weeks um but he looks out for the two main games which are the two you know the north London Derby and the Manchester City game and I'm not sure how that's going to impact HS the impact on Saka because he has a little link up of Saka all the time the positions he takes up in attacking play and and have its dropping back potentially like there's a lot of unknowns there and then with Watkins so if you did wild card now I'm not saying you put yourself in a but there is just a couple of uncertainties which yeah clear out I'll work it out what I mean is it would it would not take a lot for me to wild card because I just feel I'm already in a position of strength with three free transfers because if you Al card any transfers you've made in the international break they you get them back so I would basically not hesitate if there was a structural shift in the team like you know if Salah is out or Holland is out completely changes what you need to Target in the next few things like if Konza is out I don't care I'll just play Robinson um even ja like if tomorrow the managers actually he had his press conference already and he said you know he'll trade and he'll be fine let's say there is some rumor that Xiao Pedro is out I'll play Smith row like if I get a leak on Saturday morning because both City and Liverpool play later that day let's say you get a leak that Dio jot is not starting and D nun is starting I'll just bench him and play Smith throw so those things are not going to impact my plan I think it's only going to be if there's anything major like seismic that changes completely the structureand something really like like really big I've done a video this week actually with Andy Martin and he's activated W Cod and he's got free he's got free Ro similar to you free transfers and well you've used two now but if you activated You' get them back in and he's done that as well he's activated and I was curious what are the what are the diff the big differences between the four and the six would be the Arsenal players and uo am I right yeah but it's it's more than that it's basically what you want is the best the team with the best fixtures now is Liverpool the team with the best worst fixtures on paper is Arsenal then in game week six the team with the best fixtures is Arsenal for two three weeks and not so great I mean Liverpool's are fine it's not that bad Liverpool's are still good actually they're not bad they're not bad yeah they're not bad but you can't have everyone right so but basically you can't have it's very difficult to have Trend Salah Saka and harid so you'll have to what what I'm saying is wild card 6 allows you to maximize both where you can have gungho you can go gungho on Liverpool and then after the Wild Card you get your triple Arsenal you can have triple Liverpool for four and five you can have triple Arsenal for six and seven and I also like that because you want Arsenal and Man City for the long run like Arsenal and Man City are teams you want for the long run right now if you wild card you'll be very uncertain how much Arsenal should I have you'll have to book in transfers I feel like game week six wild card you should be able to do it without booking too much you should be able to do it with a team full of five four or five Arsenal Man City players bumo e you know basically long-term glue guys with maybe even two three transfers in your back pocket just puts you in a good spot so I just feel it's it's it's a good it's a good window to Target it's interesting you said Arsenal and City you can have long-term players because you clearly rate them as the two best teams but you don't mention Liverpool you still think Liverpool are not I know we started the Pod by talking about Liverpool not getting carried away and I agree just three games a new manager but no I might have Trend I might I I was thinking I was exactly what I was going to ask you there's a I'm sure there's a couple there I know salah's expensive it's possible to call him and just leave him in your team but I think we were talking about harand and breaking goal scoring records I think Salah this season I want to go on record I think I said it in game week three that he's gonna get the assist record this season which is 20 Kevin NE Bren and hry I think Sal is going to do it this season just the way Liverpool playing and this system yeah so I I I look I've got a little game week six wild cut draft sitting in my sitting in my screenshots it's got Tren in it's got three Arsenal it's got two City so you know there's there there is scope there to have six players from the three from the three best teams it's got bumo It's got e so it just feels like that team is good to go for for a long time uh and then I'll probably have two three transfers also free coming out of it um so I just feel yeah that team is is good to go but lots can change like you know havard's positioning is odard back or not which three Arsenal do you pick I was going to ask you that but I think that one I want to say that detail that's for for deadine d game week six is going to be a juicy one because potentially we could both be on wild card unless something happens like tomorrow activate don't I wouldn't be surprised yeah press it could happen if something like you said this is a season for lowart to wild card and uh like you you didn't consider because you do have the two best captains there's not 1% you considered Salah this week in it no I mean I would say 1% it's it would be wrong to say I didn't consider at all but I quickly brushed it aside because I just don't want to go through the pain of watching harand without Captain like yeah no and you know normally I'm a big solah Advocate I I'll talk him up I'll match him I've gone like many seasons against Holland with Salah but even me this game week here if I had even if I had Salah no it'd have to be news like you said the story regarding that he's going to miss or the probability goes in bigger than maybe but otherwise no no chance and if he misses you have your Vice Captain right so I I don't think that changes anything yeah no the team's solid you're looking a you're looking a good place PR I've got to say you let's hope Rogers gets his first return let's say let's hope Henderson gets a real return not a four-pointer and then we should be good I mean there what's let's have a look actually let's go to the let's go to the odds and talk about that so Henderson what's their clean sheet odds where is he 38 I think 36% 36 yeah yeah 36% I mean against Leicester yeah hopefully we get one I'm I'm not I don't know I'm looking at that I think Leicester will get a goal I mean yeah I mean clean sheats hard to call they are isn't it yeah like Liverpool I can say you know good chance I think Man City okay Chance like you know you can see bumo getting something there but you can see CH for such a good team and such a defensive team there was a stage when I used to look at Pep's team and think like obviously they keep the ball for 70 minutes so you only get the ball for about 20 if you're lucky but they against West Ham they freed up a lot of chances I don't know if you saw the game par the statistics looked of course I'm not saying Manchester City didn't deserve to win but they did free up I'm my God like you know they hit poting they hit crossb they had other shots or something like that there was a lot of chances they was surpris so brenford could get something there yeah and then you have Brighton if switch can to get something you have Aston Villa who are never like Rock Solid so Everton could get something it's is hard I think Liverpool are the bankers this week and and they've got three in a row so you know the the the thing of like can they do four in a row maybe the odds are that they don't keep a Clin it either we'll see I think a lot of teams look good this week so it's not like you know like we saw eight of our players are the same what do you think of the Tottenham v Arsenal the reason I ask you that not just for predictions but because of the igard and the who is it California who else did they lose is it hav got got rice rice as well that's it fine oh is he okay yeah I think he's fine um but he was start anyway I yeah he wasn't going to start anyway but the point I'm trying to get at is that they've had a couple of the international break hasn't been kind to then yeah what do you think of that fixure because normally I I always back Arsenal for that game I still back Arsenal I think look at maybe it's a little bit more kg than normal like people are thinking it'll be more high scoring because they will be open that's not arit as way like I think when you have double pivot of georgino and parte and that defense that really Elite defense that really good goalkeeper I think if it would have been a 3-1 win for Arsenal now I'm predicting a 2-1 win so I'm still thinking Arsenal are good and um if you had one of the dilemas the people watching might have is uh Pedro poro would you play him this game we Depends for who right I mean if I had if I had kza who has 42% clean sheet or 40% clean sheet so I'd play kza if I had dunk I'd play dunk if I had Gabrielle I'd play poro just for the attacking threat so it's difficult to give sort of one blanket answer but I think Po's por is okay if you had to play him but it depends for who yeah yeah and actually I just reminded myself if you're still watching please like subscribe all that good stuff we keep forgetting to do it PR us're we're near the end of the video and uh you have these bells everywhere I can see at the top you can see I can we've got it we listen we've got the graphics on full flow but still we still have to say it once in a while arak and before we finish off let's have how many of these players have you got in your team you've got the one two three I've got harand salap Pedro instead of Watkins I have isack instead of Mata have e and J so six ah you're in a good place yeah you're in a very good place this week I'll be very surprised for you not get don't say don't say it true actually yeah true this is FPL in it it does yeah it don't work like that exactly exactly all right dude good good good chat uh football is finally back or finally back again so best of luck to everybody best of luck to you um I hope for your sake you don't get any more price drops um and uh yeah we'll see you back next Thursday all right take easy everyone see you next week bye [Music] [Applause],9890,hello everybody welcome back to deadline dilemas this is press and im joined as usual by my good friend mo how are you doing im good thank you how are you press im doing all right i enjoyed the international break a little bit you miss the football but you also like a nice quiet weekend and its not just about the quiet okay its you get bored but you also theres no pain like nothing can ruin my mood this that part of the thing i dont i dont mind it what about you how was your how was your international break very good i think it was a nice break especially for me well i was going to wear my liverpool shirt price but i thought id leave it theres no need for that we ended got my man united kit my third kit so we can we can team up next weekend next week possibly but we went into the international break while i went into the international break pretty okay well talk about fb in a bit more detail but just in football in general liverpool three games undefeated no goals conceded and to beat our rivals united i was i was over the moon so i went into the international bre of a smile friend okay no its good times man when david moyes joined man united we were all very happy for the first couple of weeks as well its only after things go wrong then you start missing the messiah when we started missing sir alex so look hopefully it works out for you guys but i would want liverpool fans not to get too excited no youre right i agree with you im not getting too c away i thought i just mentioned it cuz i know youre a united fan but you are true its threee games it dont mean nothing and three reasonably easy games and again im dissing man united again but your start everybody knew your start was the best so the test will come when you play arsenal and when you play man city totally agree so how do we how do we start this week should we start with rob t i want to start with your last weeks decision because on deadline dilemas you were like ive done this move im not sure was it the right move but you backed yourself you got jao pedro you started jao pedro against arsenal and he rewarded you and now youve been tracking his flights so youre one of us no honestly it was a i felt that it was a bit of a it was a frowned upon move because i went everyone was going to go him this week but i thought no im going to go week early i didnt want to wait even though it was against arsenal for ill try my luck and ill do it and like he said it paid off for me press i was that made my weekend if im honest of you because against arsenal you dont get sniff for him to get that rebound and to finish it i was like okay this is not too bad and it means im a week ahead its a move i dont need to consider this week and as pres ive started with a lot of fires in my team so i need these transfers i was happy with that no well played well played and look i always like a longterm move paying off like some people will go for instant gratification and pick a player that has a b great fixture this week but then not so great after and then they put too much hopes and expectations on that player when they picked them in the on the opposite sense you got a player who you wanted long term if be blanked into against arsenal so be it now that was not the fixture you got him for so the points become a bonus it feels even better it does it is its one of the nicest feeling in fbo because its like a week you done early with the odds realistically against it but its still paid off and now i thought i can just forget about that this week because hes one of the hot properties this upcoming game which were going to talk about in a bit more detail and ive already got him so now i could focus my transfer which in a minute when we look at my team i had the opportunity i had money in the bank from removing an to pedro and i had i could i could improve other places which i had a lot of issues to sort so cho about that lets open your team lets go through it we can be after or during the thing we can switch to rob ts stuff as well as were talking about other stuff but why dont you read it out so henderson in goal finally a return there was a debate whether four point is a return prize or not whats your whats your opinion four point was not a return look how strict you are lords were saying four points is a return some are saying is not a return for keeper safe point return for keeper is a is a clean sheet or a rare assist fair but were so desperate for goalkeeper points desperate four points was welcome lets say i was about to say lets lets take that so he outscored rya he outscored fleen he outscored arola so all the big guys so only one clean sheet last week which was al liverpool so thats an inter so and then trent whos been outstanding and if im honest with you hes returned in three game weeks but weve been cheated if im if im totally honest with you we should have two assists and a goal so it told you were missing at least 20 points from trent if im honest with you pres but hes been hes been great no issues with him robinson was the star like he performed for me last week as well and he has to start this game week because look at my bench and then kza now is he fit i dont know if any more updated information as far as im concern ive not heard anything ke in our case you have kza i have conza if you have a good first bench it doesnt matter and it already after the match i think the post match the manager said he was he looked fine so im not expecting anything but if he misses out its not the end of the world like its not his ceiling is not exactly massive its not like tren missing out no that would be scary so thats the defense thats the back four and then in midfield weve got bruno fernandez now this is a pivotal game week ive held him for the first three game weeks pr hes been one of the high underachievers at 13 xg and still nothing and then i have to sit and watch in international break him displaying how good he is which we all know hes a good player but unfortunately at united they just dont have the players who can finish their chances and thats a big problem but against southampton this must be the one that theres a return there for me price its got to be it has to be yep i can see it i can see it this is the game so i completely agree with you people will call him a troll people will call him like man united a rubbish but youre right he has underperformed a lot like he should have got a couple of assists at least one return and then that full game when he had those two big chances so its its been unlucky it is a desperate situation because hes going to price drop again if you he is going to drop again pr price ive lost ive lost money all over the place im listen this im in trouble here when it comes to money but there not much i could do ive tried to sell some of the players how did you pick this bunch where bruno is dropping you had unu you had sank to be fair but isack k quanza k quanza man you picked them all i picked every one of them im not when are you wild carding so we can avoid your players i think well maybe game week six you better be careful because i know youre hot on that but i was close to wild card in even this international break press ive managed to hold off i was considering it i was thinking maybe after this chat maybe youll reconsider lets see i might im im willing im willing to go for it im not too scared long time ago id always keep it to very closer to christmas but now no if might i think if kza was like fully injured confirmed out and i looks ive got hall and harwood on the bench im close lets say i hear you i hear you i hear i am close you what move have you made so you said you got so ezas come in for inuko as you can see my new sign in is beside bruno fernandez right there so hes coming to the team hes a hes a pick up its a big upgrade there excited about him hes shot volume the chances hes creating hes been unfortunate people started a season of impress game week one and two and they got frustrated so they flogged him so i got him for a bit of a bargain which is good considering hes 69 but considering ive lost so much money this is good so im happy about him and its a lovely fixture as well ler hes got two home games which is big but im going to make a case for asking you why you didnt go roger and not because rogers is better than e because now i feel youve blocked yourself off salah in one move right next week would i been able to go there im trying ive got 19 i think in the bank would i have done that well if you went rogers whos five a is 69 so thats another 18m because hes i think rogers is now 51 so 18 plus 19 thats 37 bruno is 84 so that would be 121 you wouldnt get i wouldnt have been i thought i5 short it was it was a teaser i thought i had a little look but it wouldnt have been there but im willing to if i feel the urge to get sala now im willing to take a minus four and find the money somewhere else its just next week you dont need like people are getting salah as if like its impossible to go without salah its fine its just like its okay to go without holland the issue is next week holland plays arsenal so who would you captain next week lets say you couldnt go salah you just go captain no i could go j captain i could possibly go there i wouldnt be scared to go there im trying to think who my i did have alternatives let me have a look to see im just having a look right now on my team who would i go it have to be liverpool player versus bourn trent you could do trent im never the biggest fan of or you could just go h in man its not the end of the world that could be a week i risk it i do something i do something different there maybe even pedro is it against forest something different thats a week i could gamble but i might still bring him in press im not as scared i think as everyone elses im not going to break my team and panicked for the f im not im not going you have to just consider your parts and thats thats all i was talking about would have allowed a bruno to salah then i would have done that but it doesnt so its fine i think a is a fantastic pick this week rogers wrong with him i like him hes it was between the three players i had pr that i considered it was ezar rogers and seeno theyre the three i considered soos putting up the numbers it seems that changed man to be honest the shot volume and the big chances hes take having whatever that continues is a separate story but in the first game week first three game weeks looks good so i did consider him i did consider rogers but i thought i have to get him into my team as even though against the chelsea he he bailed him out there but the game weeks before he was still getting the shots and getting into positions he was unlucky remember he scored that goal and it was this allowed yes wrongly in game week two so it could have been different and it could have been 71m so as fpl managers we can be fickle at times one ruthless that removes im more than happy with him beside him ive got anthony gordon hes still here now i know a lot of people have gone cold on the newcastle assets which is understandable theyve not been that good especially performance wise i would say theyve been very good in that they havent lost theyve won two and drawn one in poor performances thats normally elite attributes if im honest with you thats what we associate if arsenal do it we say look at them premier league youve seen the games no like i have watched the games i have but in fact i think ive seen all their first three games what is weve seen it like the performance isnt at that same level no but then the point im getting at is when youre still getting the wins that it can believe you it can still give you the confidence where a performance could come up so against wolves against wolves its normally the opposite if youre performing amazing and youre not winning games like id say maybe spurs are not performing amazing but against newcastle spurs are very good and then they lost its harder for them to put in a performance this week because its on their head like we played good and we still lost like whats happening were newcastle were not even we havent even turned up yet and were beating teams so thats a powerful thing to have so that could work in the favor im im this is what im telling myself as a triple newcastle fair enough im hoping against wolves and maybe the narrative is different this season last season he couldnt he was indestructible at home games and pour away this season hes had two home games two blanks and one away game and he scored so if he scores against wolves you never know press no im im with you like i when well come to my team ill tell you i have a free transfer left i have money in the bank for isack to watkins but i wont do it because i think isack is still a good shout and theres other issues with watkins like similarly for gner unless you find an upgrade that is so far better then i think hes hes an okay hold like theres no issue with holding gordon totally agree so hes starting for me what well have this conversation now there was one stage i was considering gordon versus smith r whos first on my bench but then smith rolls minutes pr just put me off it hes been 60 to 70 minutes where at least gordon maybe the performances not being great but 90 minutes the probability is higher isnt there and set pieces like without trip here hes taking corners free kick so thats also one to watch like sher will be back so you have another tall guy in addition to burn so i think its its worth it id play gordon over smith r definitely thats my choice and you said sh will be back if he comes into the team do you think thats associated with hall starting or do you think thats completely irrelevant hall lost his plays against southampton he didnt have a great game even though they won one nil he could start its not like he cant start in fact u i would put him above just herwood bell is just as a punt in case kza doesnt start but i just think with hall the problem is youre not sure youre not sure which game kelly starts which is very strange like kelly starting over hall but hall has been his performances have been up and down so you dont want to go there like theres so many good 45 defenders that you dont want to chance it like so i think in the bench you can chance it but as a starter you just cant go there thats the reason i was asking you because if i thought he would start id consider it just for the potentially i prefer him than cona and harwood if i thought he was starting but i agree thats too much of a risk but i will move him on the bench but cona you say like i would be happy starting like if you go to robs chart if you look at the clean sheet odds like this week like last week was the complete opposite to this week where last week there were no clean sheets right there was only one team above 40 and i think what was it arsenal and they didnt keep a clean sheet this we you have a ton of teams like villa is 40 clean sheet odds which is very good brighton 42 man city 46 liverpool 46 these are good clean sheet shots even crystal palace at 36 isnt bad so i think these are teams that like for me a 40 of coner versus where is newcastle 24 i would start kza even if hall was starting its just not the most but i agree with you thats why he in my starting team and i must remind you per remember when we discussed the arsenal v brighton and we saw the clean sheet al i did say to you i wasnt comfortable with those statistics i had a feeling brighton theyre front four but did you see the first until the red card like i know i know but even then i think when i look at a team like brighton frf for i do like they will struggle not to get a goal in a game on the this was the theory same story for aston villa like aston villa should have scored against arsenal as well so like in the end it evened out where arsenal kept sheets in the first three games where maybe in the villa game they shouldnt have maybe in the brighton game if there wasnt a red card they could have but im with you like these theres a lot of good attacking teams in the league at the moment and its very hard to nail down unless its an arsenal defense maybe you can say a guardio maybe a trent and robertson is very hard to get a clean sheet expect why is why have the clean sheets gone to have one clean sheet last week but last week was predictable the games were tough the matchups were tough but still it does seem like you dont normally i dont know is the prem going down that route where i just think the manager mindsets have changed like when we started football like 20 years ago or whatever im not guessing your age or whatever but 20 25 years ago you used to have at least six to eight managers that would just set up to defend against the big teams they would do nothing else but just sit back long balls sit back long balls those are games where theyre hoping for a nil or a game goal of the counter now you have teams like crystal palace brighton villa villa is better than them bournemouth west ham loads those teams i know what you mean they back themselves to win they do i would say these are good managers which play in a system and theyre not scared to have the ball to pass through the back to sometimes they sit back but the league has changed it is no i totally agree with you totally agree with you let me go back to my team right so last name on midfield is j being happy with him its the first game he didnt return against the united 30 its a shame because it was a pretty comfortable game in the end but he did come off early which is something were starting to notice with slot its going to be interesting to see when the champions league kicks in is he going to go down the realms where he mixes the minutes between both tournaments or does he start playing a prem team and almost you see a core prem team and then a champions league if that makes sense thats what i want to watch so thats going to be quite interesting especially when i eventually want to say if i want to get triple liverpool thats going to be interesting because you might not want to go diaz you might prefer robo so i had a couple of questions to you as a liverpool fan you didnt consider instead of e going diaz because theres a lot of like diaz fever in terms of how hes looking his positioning how hes like more advanced with slot and the way theyre passing the ball and getting him behind the lines anything there that did you consider that i did consider it but i think i did consider it but i wasnt 100 sure on my liverpool triple so ive already got j and youd get locked out of salah i get locked out of salah so thats what put me off him diaz at the moment statist all these stats are very good performances on your eyes playing very good if anything when he came in i did read the article but i wasnt sure saying that diaz was like almost he type of winger and its proven to be hes hes one of the players i think him and graen bur have flourished the most under slot so its a big positive and ive got no issues of people diaz i think hes a good pick does he become a casual e with champions league in the league im im not quite sure thats an unknown were going to see very soon in the upcoming weeks but i think ezza for me and maybe because the start ive had press where we spoke about minute ago ive picked all of those players that have some of them unlucky some of them maybe not great picks maybe i wanted im scared to almost say on the pod that i wanted a certainty and ezza is like hes the main guy there like there undisputed no one can talk to him unless hes injured hes playing so thats i think i wanted a bit more of those in my team before i start not saying diaz isnt a certainty by the way i know i hear you so second question on j of course apart from reduced minutes he was at the international break whereas darwin nunes was sitting at home because he was banned from uruguay so any concerns there on j starting this week i dont think so im im im gonna say this from what ive seen since slot i was about to say clot since slots bought in this front free one of the reasons i think diaz has improved a lot i think when nunes plays hes hes very erratic nunes is the type of player he wanted to touch the ball last like running onto it and hitting it hes not the type of player when he gets the ball in too much time hes almost a danger and i think diaz at times if im honest with you last season is very frustrating within the liverpool community lords worth if he didnt start a season like this lords of liverpool fans might not admit it they wanted him gone they would have taken because he was very frustrating his decision making was poor i think salah is an elite player game changer but the introduction of j that calmness has improved diaz and im not sure if hes going to break that front free up especially as we started the season so well so i think at the moment i still think j plays okay good i think nunes will have to wait his chance and there will be chances weve seen js injury record and the games are going to come like thick and fast now so he will get minutes youve seen both f diaz and j been coming off around the 70th minute for those two so i dont think hes going to switch it now pres im comfortable j to starting okay sounds good and then your forward line so pedro who came in last week like we discussed very fortunate there so i was happy about that harand who at the moment is making a mockery of the premier league press weve seen weve been around to see pure elite strikers but this is becoming comical now like if he gets a hattick of hat tricks im not quite sure what we can say about this guys unreal so hes the captain so i didnt even consider no one else this week normally i do like to have a little look im not doing that at all and beside him is isaac who im very excited to own this week br because vice captain id vice captain is man no i fancy hes what maybe i rate him i do you saw his little interview he done after international game he is the type of player hes got that arrogance i like in a football player he knows hes hes good and elite the wolves fixure doesnt scare me that much i know the formation change has been discussed and after that chelsea battering theyre gonna have to fix up a little bit but n i think you got is like i like him ill keep the vice captain there i fanc him for a goal im quite happy people have done me a bit of a favor that theyve moved away from him when i saw him being sold pr i was like thank god this is so good news because i think hes an excellent like pick i much prefer him than watkins my goodness if isak plays 90 minutes watkins plays 60 again i definitely do like hes on pens watkins were not sure like unlikely to be on pens if you look at the again the rob t chart with the strikers the one before this yep so if you look at it esack is on 059 goals expected goals watkins is exactly the same and this assumes a full game so if watkins plays fewer than 90 minutes then watkins is lower than esack this week so look at j man hes higher than both of them that doesnt thats that is incredible its its the opposition isnt it switch but i will say this somethings not right with watkins like im not quite sure maybe im just jumping on because hes not had an incredible start like he did last season but very weird for the main dude to be playing those 60 minutes hes like their sala press i can understand what we said about jotter and diaz youve got gak pa nunes but watkins that duran he might be good but watkins is their main dude so to see him coming off somethings definitely not right especially when he hasnt got a goal youd think youd leave him on to 90 minutes to get that off his shoulders because the more games that goes the more thats going to pay on his mind ill tell you that now its going to get more and more difficult well we now know a little bit more right initially he had not played a single minute of preseason so the first two games when he came off early everyone said fine hes just getting up to speed right you when you start preseason games nobody plays 90 minutes day one so he was getting up to speed then game week three unry tells us hes carrying some injury or he was carrying an injury when he was coming back and then he withdraws from england and then now hes not seen in training like i think hell start again but his minutes are still impacted like youre not expecting 90 minutes not when they have u this midweek game which is by the way a way to young boys young boys the swiss club they have that artificial pitch they play on astral turf they play on astro thats like a bigger issue like this years champions league and by the way people who didnt check it out last week last to last week when we did this video we talked about the new champions league format and this every game matters like the seeding will matter so you might just see fewer minutes for watkins or you might see a lot of minutes and we look like idiots when he scores his brace home to everton so but thats part of it i i think i dont think isak to watkins is a desperate move you need to make case in point i cant i can do it for free and im not doing it now i prefer isak just com back to my team i prefer isak this we i like him and even with newcastles performances and its an away fixture and its against wolves nah hes one of the players i looked him ive got loads of issues but hes one of the players i didnt see like worrying me at all if im honest with you youve got a house on fire so the noisy the noisy door can wait ive started to slowly get rid of those though so the free pulling the free transfers ive used this weeks transfer was so satisfying i poured myself honestly a little drink to celebrate and cuu leaving my team i was like ah this is so good it was because hes just been in my team for he went down to 62 come on and the irony is i saw what you said on x whatever its called these days what this is the game week where he plays him and quanza i was just saying with europe starting a lot a lot of clubs will almost like reset and so if that happens pr i dont know i wont i wont be able to handle that ifu starts he now that we know that he barely plays 60 minutes doesnt make him a great pick like hes still a bad hes still not a great pick if hes not going to be first choice starting most games because thats what you need from a 65 because his competition that the guys even at the 1m below like min seeno theyre starting games theyre doing well in those games so why would you need to go there totally agree and just to finish off from all my team pr ive got on the bench matthews who doesnt even play smith roll howard and hall which discuss i might swap the order around there but thats me for this week i think im pretty locked off captain vice captain ive got 19m in the bank prs thats i just checked now so dont for next week not quite sure what im going to do yet i know a move for you next week i know a move for you next let me hear it what are you thinking bruno toon captain who the spurs got next week home to brenford thats a good thats thats a good move espe if im wild card in six thats the move ill do thats a good you need a captain next week like unless youre happy to do jot or you could just do bruno to diaz like if next week youre thinking okay or even smith row to to diaz and then you have your captaining those two is very similar the minutes i did say gakpo nunes theyre both excellent backups they could play from 70 minutes ideally when you captain you do want your captain to be a 90 minute and ideally on pens so you can get lucky so you can jam one i totally agree with you thats why you suggested ea which is fair to be honest maybe i shouldnt discount it that easily and its a good fixture leester well as vice cap but then isak is also on pen so its not between isak and a like you can see that roby chart like isak is just slightly higher than e but then thats not thats his expected goals because e will get more points if its a clean sheet and if he scores its its five points so expected points i would say a is higher than isack this week so thats and es having the shot volume hes like every 18 minute hes popping off a shot as well hes hid and like and remember every time he has a short on target positive bps 15 goal attempts as well hes so high up there when im looking at the stats right now like five chances created as well hes ticking nah good so before i go to my team im going to ask you this question because everybody is right now in a mild panic not mild panic just a mild concern is how i would put it is harand not training yesterday now today he was training its been confirmed he was training hes apparently had a private somebody passed away whos whos a mentor to him or a friend and the daily mail which nobody should believe but but they have said he may be allowed compassionately of course they know what theyre doing people will click the article to see or is he going to miss game week 4 i can say with quite some conviction that he will play he played when his grandma passed away last year if you remember i do remember so it just gives people a little bit of a mild panic now you have got smith on your team i dont think you need to bother if hes if hes missing or misses out in the end but any other views like anything different to what i said n i wouldnt i think it sounds almost harsh saying it a family member pass in a way but i think he wants that hattrick of hattricks that i cant see i cant look past that the way the type the person he is well in fact you dont get to that level when you dont hunt down every target like salah every time i see him interviewed he knows every goal every statistic everything hell be playing pr they those type of players their machines they count their goals in training its those dudes theyre not hes you see that ronaldo interview that im g to score a thousand goals and ive got a video of every single goal i scored like what a it maybe takes that mentality to you cant get like that press if youre one of those people that are happy that your team wins and youve just got an assist ronaldo and messi and them guys are in the chang of room crying thats not good enough they need to winning is a bonus they need to score their goals they like that and thats how it works so holland for me is playing this game week and two goals minimum like simple as that like it like okay lets go to my team lets go all right so despite like all the different parts weve taken like i started with two premiums you started with just holland and no like mid premium we are converging to quite an extent so ive got the same keeper as you henderson ive got two same defenders as you trent and kza i could have had robinson as well but i did hall to dunk as an ultra luxury transfer like i was why dunk press tell me please why its like almost like why dunk the two is it just because go on the next two fixtures theyre top of the ticker home to forest home towi and there is no other defender that has the same clean sheet odds for 45m that i could have afforded for for this guy i did consider rico lewis but then rico lewis plays arsenal so even though i would have got a game out of him this week next week id have had to play robinson whos home to newcastle whos fine like i think its okay fixture but with duns two fixtures i was like okay i can just play dunk in the next two its we are in different paths at the moment i had three free transfers not a sing single price drop i know thats unreal that is so i had two guys dropping three guys dropping on the international break sunday night which was gordon hall and esac and i was like what ill sell gordon for e because that i wanted to do anyway you have your eyes on that for some time and then ill do hall to dunk because thats a super luxury move but i get a little bit of higher clean sheet odds im just playing a little bit of a little bit of a higher upside game and and ill keep isak because i still think isak is good so i did two free transfers dunk for hall and e for gordon and so reading out my team so then ive got jot who you have e who you have ive got salah and rogers instead of youre bruno and gordon so its not like too different like im not captaining any of them so fair enough and our stri dunk instead of my conser instead of your robinson sorry of course so thats it and our forward line is the same xiao pedro harand isach that was my forward line from gimic one so thats thats the team captain is holland and the beautiful thing about gimi four and five you have home and away games in pairs have you noticed that like liverpool have two home games four and five villa have two home games four and five palace as well two home games four and brighton have two home games four and five aston villa have two home games four and five so thats my team and its a good team its a good youre in a good place youre like you said game from game week one i wont say youve cruised it but things have gone your way quite well especially like you said with injuries and the players not dropping in prices and stuff youve done well you picked the thing that made immediate sense to me was especially for someone like me who went quite aggressive over a rubbish bench i loved your triple liverpool how i didnt do that as well with salah i tried to almost like maximize my money and it backfired like you said i had loads of medium priced midfielders i thought i could its not backfired its just that you gotten unlucky like the reason why a lot of people are now converging towards lets have two premiums and why it looked absolutely stupid in game week one is because a lot of people said hey what about watkins what about bruno fernandez what about odard but theyve all done so why people say we should have got salah and holland but no thats not true like salah could have blanked one game bruno gets a brace or watkins starts to look amazing and suddenly you feel like i ive put all my money on two players and a confidence prize in the enablers mina rogers like a smith ro theres quite a lot of them popping up now pedro well you started off pedro but theres a good amount of players wellick would theres good cheap players that allows you to move the into midfield or where the premiums are so it makes sense now in iight it seems straightforward but in game week one i had a different vision but i like your team i think youre youre set comfortably to be honest youve youve got already next weeks and the week after captains sorted as well are youre still set on wild card six per is that like lck youre not theres nothing dependent nothing that can happen in gw four and five that changes your mind the only thing that can happen is tomorrow holland is out and ill wild card you would if you found out you play the wild ill get my three free transfers back ill play the wild card highland l team and i go from there so like its this is why wild card is not such a big deal this year like doing a wild card now and carrying free three free transfers after its pretty cool and that wild card without holland because holland is out would make would make some sense because then you dont need holland for arsenal you dont need him for away to man city i would probably think about a while card which has palmer and salah and no holland it would have watkins maybe a hts but then theres some un arsenal uncertainty i was gonna say that it wouldnt that interrupts the watkins uncertainty and the arsenal uncertainty odard is so key hes like an elite player theyre gonna struggle without him i dont care how good arsenal are he is and if hes missing some thats another one that reports are bit random i read that it could be two months read it could be three weeks im not quite sure three weeks three weeks is the consensus but apparently theres too much swelling for the mri so i dont know how people are coming up with three weeks but he looks out for the two main games which are the two the north london derby and the man city game and im not sure how thats going to impact hs the impact on saka because he has a little link up of saka all the time the positions he takes up in attacking play and have its dropping back potentially like theres a lot of unknowns there and then with watkins so if you did wild card now im not saying you put yourself in a but there is just a couple of uncertainties which clear out ill work it out what is it would it would not take a lot for me to wild card because i just feel im already in a position of strength with three free transfers because if you al card any transfers youve made in the international break they you get them back so i would not hesitate if there was a structural shift in the team like if salah is out or holland is out completely changes what you need to target in the next few things like if konza is out i dont care ill just play robinson even ja like if tomorrow the managers he had his press conference already and he said hell trade and hell be fine lets say there is some rumor that xiao pedro is out ill play smith row like if i get a leak on saturday morning because both city and liverpool play later that day lets say you get a leak that dio jot is not starting and d nun is starting ill just bench him and play smith throw so those things are not going to impact my plan i think its only going to be if theres anything major like seismic that changes completely the structureand something like big ive done a video this week with andy martin and hes activated w cod and hes got free hes got free ro similar to you free transfers and well youve used two now but if you activated you get them back in and hes done that as well hes activated and i was curious what are the what are the diff the big differences between the four and the six would be the arsenal players and uo am i right but its its more than that its what you want is the best the team with the best fixtures now is liverpool the team with the best worst fixtures on paper is arsenal then in game week six the team with the best fixtures is arsenal for two three weeks and not so great liverpools are fine its not that bad liverpools are still good theyre not bad theyre not bad theyre not bad but you cant have everyone right so but you cant have its very difficult to have trend salah saka and harid so youll have to what im saying is wild card 6 allows you to maximize both where you can have gungho you can go gungho on liverpool and then after the wild card you get your triple arsenal you can have triple liverpool for four and five you can have triple arsenal for six and seven and i also like that because you want arsenal and man city for the long run like arsenal and man city are teams you want for the long run right now if you wild card youll be very uncertain how much arsenal should i have youll have to book in transfers i feel like game week six wild card you should be able to do it without booking too much you should be able to do it with a team full of five four or five arsenal man city players bumo e longterm glue guys with maybe even two three transfers in your back pocket just puts you in a good spot so i just feel its its its a good its a good window to target its interesting you said arsenal and city you can have longterm players because you clearly rate them as the two best teams but you dont mention liverpool you still think liverpool are not i know we started the pod by talking about liverpool not getting carried away and i agree just three games a new manager but no i might have trend i might i was thinking i was exactly what i was going to ask you theres a im sure theres a couple there i know salahs expensive its possible to call him and just leave him in your team but i think we were talking about harand and breaking goal scoring records i think salah this season i want to go on record i think i said it in game week three that hes gonna get the assist record this season which is 20 kevin ne bren and hry i think sal is going to do it this season just the way liverpool playing and this system so i look ive got a little game week six wild cut draft sitting in my sitting in my screenshots its got tren in its got three arsenal its got two city so theres there is scope there to have six players from the three from the three best teams its got bumo its got e so it just feels like that team is good to go for a long time and then ill probably have two three transfers also free coming out of it so i just feel that team is good to go but lots can change like havards positioning is odard back or not which three arsenal do you pick i was going to ask you that but i think that one i want to say that detail thats for deadine d game week six is going to be a juicy one because potentially we could both be on wild card unless something happens like tomorrow activate dont i wouldnt be surprised press it could happen if something like you said this is a season for lowart to wild card and like you didnt consider because you do have the two best captains theres not 1 you considered salah this week in it no i would say 1 its it would be wrong to say i didnt consider at all but i quickly brushed it aside because i just dont want to go through the pain of watching harand without captain like no and normally im a big solah advocate ill talk him up ill match him ive gone like many seasons against holland with salah but even me this game week here if i had even if i had salah no itd have to be news like you said the story regarding that hes going to miss or the probability goes in bigger than maybe but otherwise no chance and if he misses you have your vice captain right so i dont think that changes anything no the teams solid youre looking a youre looking a good place pr ive got to say you lets hope rogers gets his first return lets say lets hope henderson gets a real return not a fourpointer and then we should be good there whats lets have a look lets go to the lets go to the odds and talk about that so henderson whats their clean sheet odds where is he 38 i think 36 36 36 against leicester hopefully we get one im im not i dont know im looking at that i think leicester will get a goal clean sheats hard to call they are isnt it like liverpool i can say good chance i think man city okay chance like you can see bumo getting something there but you can see ch for such a good team and such a defensive team there was a stage when i used to look at peps team and think like they keep the ball for 70 minutes so you only get the ball for about 20 if youre lucky but they against west ham they freed up a lot of chances i dont know if you saw the game par the statistics looked of course im not saying man city didnt deserve to win but they did free up im my god like they hit poting they hit crossb they had other shots like that there was a lot of chances they was surpris so brenford could get something there and then you have brighton if switch can to get something you have aston villa who are never like rock solid so everton could get something its is hard i think liverpool are the bankers this week and theyve got three in a row so the thing of like can they do four in a row maybe the odds are that they dont keep a clin it either well see i think a lot of teams look good this week so its not like like we saw eight of our players are the same what do you think of the tottenham v arsenal the reason i ask you that not just for predictions but because of the igard and the who is it california who else did they lose is it hav got rice as well thats it fine is he okay i think hes fine but he was start anyway i he wasnt going to start anyway but the point im trying to get at is that theyve had a couple of the international break hasnt been kind to then what do you think of that fixure because normally i always back arsenal for that game i still back arsenal i think look at maybe its a little bit more kg than normal like people are thinking itll be more high scoring because they will be open thats not arit as way like i think when you have double pivot of georgino and parte and that defense that elite defense that good goalkeeper i think if it would have been a 31 win for arsenal now im predicting a 21 win so im still thinking arsenal are good and if you had one of the dilemas the people watching might have is pedro poro would you play him this game we depends for who right if i had if i had kza who has 42 clean sheet or 40 clean sheet so id play kza if i had dunk id play dunk if i had gabrielle id play poro just for the attacking threat so its difficult to give one blanket answer but i think pos por is okay if you had to play him but it depends for who and i just reminded myself if youre still watching please like subscribe all that good stuff we keep forgetting to do it pr usre were near the end of the video and you have these bells everywhere i can see at the top you can see i can weve got it we listen weve got the graphics on full flow but still we still have to say it once in a while arak and before we finish off lets have how many of these players have you got in your team youve got the one two three ive got harand salap pedro instead of watkins i have isack instead of mata have e and j so six ah youre in a good place youre in a very good place this week ill be very surprised for you not get dont say dont say it true true this is fpl in it does it dont work like that exactly all right dude good chat football is finally back or finally back again so best of luck to everybody best of luck to you i hope for your sake you dont get any more price drops and well see you back next thursday all right take easy everyone see you next week bye,9291
13,FFScout_,mq6v-RP0IlY,FPL GW4 Q&amp;A! ⁉️ | TOM + SAM! | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25,2024-09-12T16:13:02Z,[Applause] good afternoon what is going on everybody and welcome to your game we 4 FPL Q&A no a is not shaved off his beard um he can't make it this week because he's been called in for work so I've had to step in uh after burning questions yesterday but I'm joined by Sam as usual Sam how are you doing I'm really well thank you Tom like once more into the breach for you this week another video I know I know I need to step up for ours this week yeah but you know it'll be fine we just replace as with you and I'm sure that there'll be no Chelsea biased in the same way that there's no Brighton biased either from as when he's on here and it'll be great we we don't seem to have to get a consistent Q&A team like I missed one so we had Andy step in then we got back together for a week now he's off and we've got you in it's like a merry go round in here yeah well um yeah it's good to get a different perspectives anyway um had a good chat with Harry yesterday on burning questions because I don't have Harland and he does so um I know you have Harland as well you're a crazy man yeah well we'll see we'll see anyway um before we get into this video we need to have a quick message for our sponsors uh and that that sleeper this week um do get your questions in while we chat about sleeper for for a few minutes and then we'll get into answering your questions so yeah so sleeper we've teamed up with sleeper this year as well as the pickham league which is the predictions competition um with great prizes they also have a great uh draft game uh on their app which we as a core team at Scout got involved in with last week uh where we did our draft as you can see on screen um we had a 10 10 person draft Yeah and uh it was great fun it was something new for me CU i' never done a draft before but yeah I I picked last so uh I wasn't the best but how do you think it went and did you enjoy it you know it really surprised me how many of the core team hadn't played a draft version of of the game before because I've played it a few times like alzy and I did a draft together years ago when FPL first launched their draft game um and I really enjoyed playing I always have a draft team every year and this year I've I've now got three sleeper drafts one obviously with you guys in the core team one and the draft of Legends with all the FPL content creators that sleeper have been posting about and then another one that I'm doing with some of my patrons and I love it the sleeper app because I think the thing that it does the other FPL draft games that I've played in the past doesn't do is it gives you a rating for your team and suggest whether you're lik to win or lose and by how much buy it gives you the predicted points that the players that you have in your team are likely to get and you can make your judgments based on that you also have the ability to move players in and out before they kick the ball before their game kicks off so that you can avoid them if they aren't starting that week but I think when you have a 10 person draft it is actually really hard and I felt for you having last pick when we did it because I had last pick in the draft of Legends I picked his first player as well for you I know went straight in with a Spurs pick i l that um and I think does make you think slightly differently depending upon what position you're in because obviously if you get first pick like Mark had in our league you then don't get to pick again until pick 20 and by the time you get there and you've had 19 other players you know disappear you're in a very different spot whereas for you you have the back-to-back picks of 10th and 11th and then again um so you have to think a bit more strategically about the players that are likely to start but if you haven't done one it genuinely is really good fun we did our slightly differently we all got on a zoom call and laughed at each other mostly at Chris for picking Everton players or not picking Everton players as the case may be but there's something really fun about doing a draft league and talking to each other as you're doing it but the chat function in the app if you can't be together is also brilliant so really like the sleeper stuff yeah for sure uh do check that out there's a link in the description uh to join our pick him League which again is just um a simple free predictions competition with some great prizes and then there's also a link to download the app uh and make your own draft league as well um so yeah stay tuned for more content on Scout about our draft uh see who does what um and who who manages to win it I'm not too confident looking at my squad but maybe Reese James will come back to Fitness and uh give me a chance um yeah you're laughing at that I love the Reese James pick particularly when you accidentally managed to drop him and then had to wait for him to come back into your team yeah yeah so do check out that those links in the description um and now we will get into the questions um so let's start with this question which is Saka to Salah and Quanza to Le dunk for free how do you feel about that there's a lot of people I think that are going to be thinking about doing sacka to Salah this week and if you purely base it on fixtures you can completely understand why people would do it right it enables you to hit two really nice fixtures on paper for Salah and at the same time avoid probably two of the hardest fixtures maybe even the two hardest fixtures that Arsenal have this year with obviously Man City away but also like the Northland and Derby although they've they tend to do quite well when they come to us it's a difficult fixture because of the emotional stuff that goes alongside the the north London Derby so if you can avoid it then I can see why some people would I think for me the big thing though is this is selling sacka because come game week six when the Arsenal Fixtures massively shift for the better you're then going to be wanting to get sacka back so it's just working out whether it's worth that in taking the hit to bring them in maybe having to take a hit again to swap it and presumably by the time game week six rolls around you won't want to sell Salah so then it's finding some other way to get to get sacka back into your team I can afford to do this this week I've got enough money in the bank to just go straight from sacka up to Salah but I don't want to saca's record against B is ridiculous he got 25 points against us last season more than he got against any other side defensively Spurs have always got at least one moment in them of nonsense definitely probably multiple moments of nonsense during the course of this game and yes we'll attack um and we will see the injuries and the suspensions at Arsenal as an opportunity and probably be more attacking as a result of that but I do worry I do worry a little bit um about as a Spurs fan about saca's ability to score against us and without erard do we see hav Dro in the mid if we see hav dropp in the mid do we see sacka push up top do we see Sterling therefore playing saca's position or do we see Sterling go up top and zaka stay where he is whatever happens I think zaka has the potential for this to be a really really good game week so sell him actual Peril I think would be would be my uh advice yeah yeah I don't mind it if it's for free um it's just that Harland doesn't have Harland has such has a good fixture this week which complicates it like if Salah was massively the best Captain it would be more obvious but you can probably get away with it I think without having Salah this week um and then the second part of that question was Quan to dunk I really like that uh I've got L dunk so that's probably why I like it um I'll be starting him this week if switch at home I think Brighton's defenses look good under the new manager for brin's back now um so yeah but don't you really only like it until game week six because you get the fixture ticket from game week six to gameweek 16 and Brighton a second bottom only southampt for defense and Brighton it's only Southampton that have got a worst defensive run after six so yeah you get dunk for the next two weeks but then after that do you really want him like I think if I was going to I mean yeah it depends who else you have I mean yeah I got dunk because I needed cover for this week with Gabrielle that may be what he's thinking um yeah I mean I think I would I'd rather have like an itswitch Defender go for leaf Davis or a gr Greaves or somebody like that I think because that you get more long-term longevity out of them and you have to play them every week presumably they're not going to be your first choice Defender so if if they're replacing Quanza then you can kind of play around with it a little bit more I think I think I'd prefer somebody like that over dunk yeah fair enough um we had another question would you bench embo or coner obviously coner limped off for England uh but the England manager said it wasn't too bad um but yeah as human concert is all right who would you be playing the defender or the attacker I'm benching Boo this week by are you yeah well the plan was always to play Rogers so it's slightly different to the question but I mean I general rule of life for me is always back the attack so if I'm torn between a Defender and an attacker I'll always play the attacker over the defender um simply because I think you get more upside potential out of your attacking option and particularly as we haven't seen Man City being solid defensively this season like I do think that in the next two weeks it looks tough right man city and then Spurs for brenford but with the way that brenford play and particularly the way that M buo has been playing I do think that he could score in both of those fixtures do I think but kza gets if he starts I guess it isn't if if he starts then I would expect a clean sheet in that fixture because it's Everton and they've been shocking however asena defensively haven't set the world on fire themselves either so I think I'd play Ando this week I really do yeah I thinking yeah you though isn't it six points yes yeah you're not getting any more than six for cona because you would expect that Aston Villa score goals in that game and therefore you'd expect it to be the attackers that would pick up the bonus points yeah I mean the flip side is coner is not going to come on if he's not starting you wouldn't have thought so that's true you you know there's a good chance you end up with in boore anyway but yeah I think I'd play the attacker you saw against dip switch Man City conceded one um they conceded last week didn't they to West Ham as well so yeah they tend to concede one um so yeah I think we're both agreed on emo there uh next question pick two of salanki Rogers or Smith row now you were saying before the stream you think sank is going to be back yeah I he be back but yeah we'll have to see what post's got to say the good thing about Posta kogu is he will tell you the truth so if sank is available he'll tell you if sank is not available he'll tell you um I think from what I'm I've been hearing he and vaner will both be available for the weekend which is massive from a Spur's perspective um so who were the other two uh Rogers and Smith row so that's West Ham at home for Smith row and Everton at home for Rogers I think you got to play Rogers personally you have to play Rogers yeah you absolutely have to play Rogers I think the thing with salanki is he's either starting problem is it's going to be he'll give you he will give you the answer tomorrow b k ifan is gonna start I'd start him over Smith roow yeah yeah I agree with that I just think with the amount of chances that we we will create he you have to back him to to convert something in his first North London Derby at home in front of the fans as well because he hasn't made a home game yet his only game was away at Leicester so this will be his first game for us in the Tottenham Stadium yeah I Smith R has not started the season hugely well either so I think I'd have to bench him yeah I think Rogers is interesting because his data is actually really poor and I think he's like if he blanks this week I think people's opinions might start shifting a bit on him because he's playing well but he's not getting points and his his expected goal involvement is is quite low uh compared particular with the Champions League then kicking off as well yeah just on that salanki obviously you're bigging up salanki so what's your opinion on Arsenal Defenders this week because I'm currently benching Gabrielle for Robinson because I think Spurs will score I was saying Terry yesterday like if he gave me five quid I'd put it on to Spurs on both teams to score because that seems you'd be pretty silly to F against that so score scores for both sides normally I would back the Arsenal defense to keep a clean sheet but genuinely the I think the way that we play knowing we won't keep a clean sheet we will go we will just attack it will be attack attack attack attack attack and I just can't see that we don't score in that one so if you've got the thing with Gabrielle is that he's always got that element of attacking threat like I've got celba my conversation is is around him because his his likelihood of an attacking return is maybe less than Gabrielle's and so maybe there's a bigger conversation to be had there but with Gabrielle there's always that attacking threat so like I've got porro I'll start him even though I don't think he'll clean she and I think I'd feel the same about Gabrielle but equally if it's a conversation between between starting Gabrielle or starting Robinson then I think you have to look at starting Robinson because he's got more likelihood of an attacking well probably got a similar likelihood of an attacking threat but more likelihood of a clean sheet this weekend so his upside is maybe greater than Gabrielle's yeah I mean Harry Harry said it on burning questions Harry said it was obvious and he was actually deciding between parro and Gabrielle and he was always going to play Robinson which I thought was interesting because I wouldn't be benching parro to be honest against anyone um I don't think you can porro I think if it's a choice between Gabrielle and porro you play porro because the attacking threat is so mucher for him yeah although yeah as British 87 says in the chat bench Gabriel app perel yeah that bullet that he's going to score that bullet header um but it's the same with with any premium asset right and and I said it on the official pod this week if you've if you've listened to that or watched that on YouTube I think if you if you have a player like porro like Trent like bardal like any of those expensive Defenders Gabrielle SBA Ben White and you decide to play the fixtures and bench them you have the risk of one they could still clean sheet in that game and two they've got attacking upside that's why they're so expensive so there's always an element of risk particularly if you're benching one of them to play a 4.5 or 4.6 now Defender but I think you do have to play the upside of of potential points returns and where's the ceiling and I do think at at Arsenal it's unlikely that Gabrielle gets a clean sheet and an attacking return he might get one and I would if I was going to suggest he gets anything it'll be a goal I just don't see him clean sheet in against us I might be wrong but I can't see it yeah Harry said in the chat he benched Gabrielle for several goals last season so don't listen to him um there you go Harry uh we had a couple super chats which we should get to but go on Sam sorry no I was just going to say I'm hoping he does nothing I'm he gets two points you're going to that game aren I'm going to that game yeah and last last year Tom do you remember every time I went to the games it went absolutely horribly wrong so this year I'm hoping that we don't have the same kind of problems so Captain Your Arsenal players that's what you're saying gosh I hope not all right we got a couple of super chats which we'll do um first of all from Davis family which they are asking uh Le hold they saying so three free transfers that's the context uh one move of leis Hall to Luca Dean for the next obviously vill's next two fixtures or a double move of xia of Chris Wood to xia Pedro which would fund Lewis Hall up to Rico Lewis I just quickly say that we've had press conference today and Chris Wood got back late from International Duty so Nuno said he has to assess him basically um and so did J Pedro but the Brighton manager was a bit more confident on Sha Pedro he said that basically he'll be in the squad as long as he recovers um so I guess what do you think about that do you think Luca Dean's a good punt for two weeks I mean I'm always a bit wary of Luca de yeah because I mean like I was worst last season why when Moreno was there as well because you never really knew who was going to get the nod who was going to start and I do worry about rotation with him yeah and particularly around the Champions League like you bring in a player that could potentially and not start in in one of the games um I think I'd prefer pal Torres of the Aston Villa Defenders like I just think you're a bit more safe there so I think if I was going to do it I would do that um I think I would I I like this move I like these I like the double move if you want to pump Rico Lewis I think Rico Lewis is like it depends what type of manage you are I wouldn't do it just because I think he might get benched but if you want to take take the risk is it could pay off but I would probably get well back over jaia Pedro if you're really targeting these next two weeks because like they're both they're probably both going to start twice but you would think jel Pedro's got an early sub this weekend with heavy legs well he doesn't start him at all this week and brings him off the bench if needed yeah well Beck state is actually better this year yeah it is and and I think he could he has got other players he can play in the J Pedro position so I I would do the same actually I think I would bring well back in this week the RICO Lewis thing I am I don't like it but some people do yeah Lee and I fundamentally disagree on this because he thinks it's like an Nob brainer to have Rico Lewis and I just think Rico Lewis has got benching written all over him at some point like no there is absolutely no way I think the car Walker stays on the bench all season for Rico Lewis to start every game uh I just don't see it happening now yes it could be that kyl Walker starts in the Champions League and Rico Lewis starts in the Premier League I suppose that's possible but we don't know that yet and I I just feel like I don't trust Man City to keep a clean sheet in any game ever because they have they're a bit spursy from the defensive perspective like they do like to let go a goal and wipe out the clean sheet and by the way I'm not just talking about the last two week this is like a long thing like last season I had vardal and vardal was it it was an exception though because the clean sheet would go you'd feel frustrated but then you'd get an attack in return and you'd feel better about it so it was kind of okay whereas with REO Lewis like he's definitely definitely got the attacking threat and could absolutely get some attacking returns but for me I'm not the sort of manager that wants to take a risk on players starting particularly Defenders like I want my Defenders to be as close to guaranteed starters every week because you don't want your he's probably going to be in there in your like what third or maybe fourth Defender slots and I just think you don't want to be getting too low down um so for me yeah I don't I don't like Rico Lewis but I know a lot of people do so I know I'm I'm in the minority probably I think I think if you're well cing game week six if you're set on that i' I'd go for Rico Lewis um so yeah that's probably where I stand on that um and then the second Super Chat we had uh I don't think there's a question but feel free to drop one in and we can pick it up but it just says hi Thomas hope you both well tripled up on Liverpool with my world card uh Jackson and J Pedra also coming in and hoping to improve on 129k well I wish I was 129k um that's incredible it's a good start to the season that is and actually tribling up on Liverpool this week is a place that I wish I could get like I can double up to treble up I'd have to take a hit and I'm not necessarily opposed to taking a hit I just think that I just don't really want to because actually the players that I'd be taking out I think could easily return as well this week it's I think it's a really tough moment for managers at the minute because you either you've either just wild carded like you and then you're thinking about can I just roll through it can I wait a few weeks that I can make my changes ahead of six because the wild card team maybe isn't perfect for six or you're wild carding now and trying to build a team that works for now and six or you're trying to do what I'm doing and that's just be calm and not panic and then ride it through but in doing that not take too many hits but keep up with the people that have just wild carded it's fascinating I think at the minute and so if you're already at that rank then you're doing a sterling job very much so and I love the Jackson pick as well he's he was on my world card last week he scored golden assist no he's he's just a good player getting points as far as I'm concerned is he I think he's second for forwards expected goal involvement as well good fixtures I like him he's a good player he's a good pick there you go Jackson I don't know I just don't trust him I just don't trust him that's the problem like we've seen him before right and he reminds me so much in some way some ways of Darwin like like load of shots tar numbers they Mark better yeah but I don't know I I don't know how I feel about it am I might be that in two game weeks time I feel differently and on wild cut the fixtures are there the fixtures are definitely there I just I don't know how I feel about Chelsea generally to be honest Tom we'll score lots of goals we might concede a few basically that's how I feel yeah probably right a bit like Spurs then it sounds like do you reckon you score more goals than us this season maybe we got a bit of a head start now after we got six we got four against Everton oh yeah fair enough we haven't played them yet that's true we play ballshit no I actually think we'll be battling out for fourth I know you disagreed but vill Newcastle man united I don't really see why we can't compete with them okay you're so not convinced on Chelsea really not let's let's bring it back from Chelsea well by talking about how in kungu is such a rubbish pick and I was so wrong on that uh Sam asks what you do in kungu to garnacho yes I would doing kingu to Gar I mean gacho though is he the best mid prize mid um mad way no I actually think Mada is quite a good bet I I don't hate having just said all that about Chelsea I really don't hate the Mada pick I really don't I think he's the right option he'll keep starting yeah exactly and obviously got got a return for England I know it doesn't count in FPL but has continued to have some form for England as well when he came on um is garnacho the best pick I think he's a good pick like Southampton this week because it's Southampton this week Moma as well someone's mentioned in the chat I like that and I like the Mina pick as well I also like the seeno pick and all of these guys are cheaper and save your budget so depending upon what you're trying to achieve with the rest of your team going in for a Mina a matoma or Seena youve you've got options in that price point I really like the Seena pick like if I was I know they've got you l so you probably disagree with me but I really like attack against is never a bad idea no and I really like him as an option moving forward as well but I do kind of like the gache pick weirdly I just think if anyone's going to score from man united it's likely to involve him e leester at home oh is he seven no he's a bit more expensive actually isn't he yeah you got you've got to have a bit more because he's 6.9 I think so but if you've got that extra bit more then yeah you can go there or if you've got a little bit more again go foro at 7.1 yeah I think I prefer Moma to gacho that's my opinion um also on and kungu I will just say if you're selling him for a hit I think there is a chance he starts this week because I don't think Netto will play basically because he's played twice for Portugal and moresa said he's managing his minutes and he can't play twice in a week so I think either enu or Sancho will start on the left this weekend but I would I still wouldn't recommend keeping Inu but if if it's for a hit I might just ch I maybe just chance it um I think if quicker you can get rid of an kinki the better to be honest yeah that's probably Fair who who was picking up before the season I can't remember all of us I think I was definitely you you're the problem actually I am I owe a lot of people apologies for that yeah I started with him I attacked him off early quickly um like I I think Rogers Onana at Aston Villa if you don't have them and want to play their fixes by not having Watkins go cheaper there trial rate as well at FM decent option yeah yeah so I think I like and you like gacho so one of those two probably um next question start Gordon or Rogers Gordon is away at wolves and Rogers is Everton at home you have to start Rogers I think do you think I mean is there no one else you can bench we have this a lot people are like and I go can't we just bench somebody else just like invent some other random player um I I'd bench Rogers rogers's data is really poor yeah for sure Gordon is is like Gordon's almost an elite asset like he's so consistent and Rogers hasn't gotten a return this season an elite asset it's like at being on here with as this is in his generational talents um benching Gordon at all I would not bench Gordon no what what we were just saying that wolf ship six mad scored a hat trick from the right wing which is where Gordon will probably be playing if Barnes plays I I I'd start Gordon every day we disagree then because I think I don't I don't think you can bench somebody against Everton they are so bad they are so bad yeah I think you have to play that fixture why have you got Rogers if you're not going to play him against Everton I yeah I suppose so but then why have you got Gordon if you're not going to play him at all cuz he's like 7.5 yeah I reckon points I reckon the rate my team would favor Gordon but yeah the fixture bran weight's not back is he so Everton are probably going to be just as bad um Everton are going to be terrible but I don't think they can defend and surely I mean Viller have got the attacking threat I think you have to play Rogers I get what you're saying about Gordon I wouldn't want to bench him either I'd find another way to not bench him bench another player bench Gabrielle instead or CRA or I don't know but there must be somebody else you could bench drop your team in the chat I'll tell you if there's another player you can bench yeah cool uh the next question best time to World card outside of game week four and six cuz this could be your strategy G maybe um and then Marcus adds his game week seven a good time well what's difference between six and seven it's Harland has fullam at home doesn't he so if you don't have Harland that could be a reason to World card in seven yeah I'm just looking at the fixture ticker uh yeah and where's it International break in between seven and eight have we got next International break I'll check you keep talking I'll check I think that might be the next International break like looking at the fixture ticket I think the only major difference between a wild card in six and a wild card in seven is Man City Brighton are in the middle of a pretty awful run yes it's eight is the break SE after seven is the break after seven yeah I don't think there's enough difference between what the team you'd create for a wild card in six to a team you'd create for a wild card in seven to not like if you don't have yeah but I just don't think there's enough in it like I think you could wild card in six and get Harlem for Newcastle like I don't think there's enough in the changes that you would make like you there's much bigger gain to be had World carding in six with Arsenal and players like that so waiting one week just to avoid Harlem playing Newcastle doesn't make a lot of sense to me I'm looking at potentially 12 as a wild card window um but quite like that I don't mind the world card in the intern next International break I don't I don't mind that at all because then you're what seven game weeks into it you've got good understanding it's two weeks of opportunity um the question I have about game week a is how much would I actually change in my team like in terms of fixtures I don't think there's enough change to make make big changes but I guess there would be in terms of form of players potentially and it would be probably more changing around the edges like I suppose Spurs would avoid the Man United game if you were wild carded in seven but I don't yeah I think gameweek 12 potentially is where I'm looking might I don't I don't know is my honest answer it's probably going to be eight or 12 for me yeah I mean I think if you're not set on doing it in six then you've obviously got some Arsenal players I'd imagine I've got two yeah yeah I yeah I'm talking more in general but like that's probably you wouldn't work card in six if you had already triple Arsenal so no exactly and I think by the time six rolls in I could easily have triple Arsenal without needing to wild card um and the other players that I'm invested in I would still have so it's Bren possibly as well you I think if you you wild card in six if you're a little bit short of Arsenal and if you haven't gotten BR or vissa um without hits i' I'd say I'd agree with that yeah and then har obviously for seven and nine you probably need I say that as a non-owner um but yeah are you planning to get him in yeah well yes in in short yes but in game week 7 we'll see because Palmer has Brighton or Forest one of the two at home and sacka has Leicester at home so there's a chance I could go against Holland that week but then in game week nine for Southampton at home then he'll definitely be coming in so what you'll sell Palmer uh yeah Palmer will be going Salah to Saka in six and then Watkins Salah zaka yeah in six for Lester and Southampton I mean I get that but you don't even have Sal now no I know but but I need I need the money somehow don't I I need the money and I want to keep I think I want to keep Trent that that is the thing and that is that is kind of the point isn't it is that you you can't have everybody this year so like I've got saaka where you've got Salah you're basically doing a bit of a hokey Koke with Saka and Salah and you Salah in and then you swap them back and then yeah and then you'll Hokey Cokey around with Palmer and Haren you basically taken Haren out for Palmer and then you swwa them back again yeah later right that's what I'm doing this year just chasing the fixtures chase the fixtures it makes sense yeah and I think if you're chasing the fixtures then get the best Captain every week and Chase the fixtures if you're chasing the fixtures then six is the next best moment and after that it's probably 12 Yeah Yeah well yeah stay tuned to the site because if Sam is wild carding in 12 she'll definitely be um writing about that and that's interesting I haven't thought about a 12 wild card yet um next question from Heather uh bench one of trior Watkins or esack trior yeah reluctantly but I think you have to yeah I think you have to you got two penalties I think Watkins will be on penalties I reckon yeah he's so desperate for a goal there's no way he doesn't take one if they get it this weekend wow do you not can take it well he scored for England didn't he under 21s yeah I think he'll take it I I no I don't think that he surely he's too Junior he's not going to be able to pull Rank and get a penalty off Watkins does Watkins want them didn't want one for England true was he on for shoot out I well I heard a malicious rumor it might be a malicious rumor allegedly you need to allegedly that um because there was that video wasn't there of Trent saying he didn't want it yes and that was supposedly about Watkins so if he doesn't if he doesn't want one for England different pressure though World Euro shoot of course and it might not have even been about him it might just be people you know nonsensing up I can't even remember fim was on the pitch at that point I think he was um but I I don't know like he didn't take it all of last season and I know they had Douglas Louise but if he he's their Striker Tans people saying in the chat oh yeah there's Tans as well yeah that's a good point I mean we're not going to know basically until we get one but I just think he's missed like four sitters he's going to be so desperate for a goal especially if they're winning if they're winning two nil it wouldn't shock me if Watkins took it um it wouldn't surprise me either but I just think they've got other options I wouldn't guarantee Watkins to be their penalty take I guess yeah yeah here's a question uh from Craig he's asking is it worth doing concert or Robinson to Robertson for two or three weeks or roll the transfer I think I think it's not a bad idea to Target these two games for Liverpool especially as he says he wants to Wild Card in six or seven if you want a wild card in six or seven then I would 100% do conza to Robertson this week and Target Liverpool yeah because I don't think like I I appreciate that is Everton this week and then it's Wolves but would it s would it actually shock you if they don't keep a clean sheet astonvilla defensively haven't been great well no they only kept nine last year when they came fourth they they're not actually the best ofans no and they and I'd say actually they're even weaker this year than they were last year and I appreciate that we've already got three fixtures worth of data to go on there who was the other ones Robin yeah what coner or Robinson I don't I would feel Robinson's got worse fixtures West Newcastle but I would prefer to have him in my team for the attacking yeah but I would do conza absolutely would do con to Robertson and have triple Liverpool yeah yeah I agree um how this slightly unprofessional but how long do you usually go for maybe like 10 more minutes I'm just I don't how long does I we we normally do about 50 minutes but we can do 55 if you like I we'll keep going then lots of more questions um so what we got Steve saying sell you'll like this or maybe not actually sell sun to Salah for a hit before you come in with Spurs I would not do it unless you were captaining Sala this week because we've both said we think Arsenal are going to concede and he's on pen yeah he's on pens well is he still on pens if s is on the pit pitch we don't know that yet no we don't or he could be up front if sank is not on the pitch I suppose but he could be up front if sank is not on the pitch um he's got really good record actually in recent times against Arsenal for a you don't surely you don't take Sun out for a hit you can't I don't think you can minus if it was for free I'd be tempted but it's two home games for Spurs it's the Home North London Derby and against an Arsenal team that are weaker without rice and Ard and then it's brenford at home who we always seem to score twice against they quite often score against us but we always seem to get a couple against them so I would expect sun to be in those as well I don't think you can I don't think you can hit Sun out if you don't have Harland which would be a surprise because most people have one of Harland or Salah but if you did need a captain I think you You' do the hit I wouldn't be against that but if you've got harand sitting there with the arm band I I wouldn't do it yeah I think I would agree with that yeah yeah definitely um this is more of a statement but Leaf Davis is the best 4.5 Defender I think you agree with that yeah I don't disagree with that I've been talking about him all summer and then stupidly didn't get him in my team um for game week one I don't really know why but he will be a player that I'll be looking at in the next couple of weeks um I just think he he makes absolute sense if you don't have the0 five and you want to go for Grieves them fine um because it switches like the fact that it switched it top of the fixture ticker from I think it's genuinely from now until 16 yeah from now until gameweek 16 they set top of the ticket they' got one red fixture in there it's against Spurs in 11 like you a nip switch Defender makes a whole world of sense and I like Clee Davis for his attacking threat yeah yeah I yeah I think I agree but I wouldn't like they are rip switch and you know they're not going to keep many clean sheets like right Hampton Villa West Ham Everton brenford Leicester Toten Man United and Forest Palace Bournemouth wolves that's in the next four six eight 10 12 13 weeks I reckon there's one two three four five five or six clean sheets in there in how many games 13 one and two yeah that's Golden Glove levels Southampton Everton Leicester yeah but what we're talking about switch not Arsenal yeah but IP switch has started the season way better than any of them three I think they'll CLE sheet against all three of them fair enough sounds like you should be buying Leaf Davis I I will be at some point I just got I've got to stop using my transfers bringing in Trent so I can do Barco to Leaf Davis that's what I want to do that's what I should have started the season with I don't know why I didn't really silly yeah uh cool uh next question from Gabrielle or Gabriel uh which sorry if that's the wrong one is it is it the Gabrielle is he moaning that we're benching in this week imagine if it was he's saying he's got a bullet header coming yeah yes yeah he's like I'm going to Bullet header in against this uh sell Smith Road to Lis Diaz for a hit I would I think I think leis Diaz has been in unreal form yeah only har get 90 minutes twice that is a very fair point yeah I think we have to wait for slot yeah because if it was klopp he wouldn't start him this week but it's not klopp anymore it's slot yeah having said that having said I just do it um I wouldn't do it because I've just g game was very I think will Tuesday night at 9:30 yeah they were saying it was really hot like mascara got stretched off a heat stroke they were saying so and he's played 2 90 minutes has he y yeah yeah I maybe not for a hit then because Smith row West Ham at home um Smith row could get something it's going to be listen to slot tomorrow if slot says I'm starting leis Diaz if if or if slot says something like I don't care about their International exploits yeah their profession they can play then then I probably would do it because I think the fixtures for Liverpool for the next couple of really well arguably for the next five including the Chelsey game Sorry Tom in eight I think a really nice so you could bring him in and keep him and that hit then isn't really Four Points this week it's spread over five we period which feels much much better but if slot says anything like oh I'm really wary of we're going to have to assess how they've come back and all that jazz then just be mindful of it yeah uh so someone FPL onions is saying Sam if you believe that you'd get three times I switch defense for 13 million I there is a very big possibility that I get double lip switch defense in the next couple of weeks I actually have Greaves on my bench to be fair yeah I honestly think that I can see myself having gves and leaf Davis in the next two or three weeks backing I switch big that's it's a bit mad isn't it I also quite like to lap up top as well might go all in on it switch do you think they'll get relegated this year I think there's currently three worst teams in the league Southampton Leicester and Everton Everton will be Everton will win one nil at home after Christmas and be fine when bran weight comes back they'll be fine in my opinion I think they lose this weekend against Villa I think they lose against Leicester I think they'll lose against Palace Newcastle they lose against them they lose against dip switch they won't lose their first eight games I think they might not they'll get a point they might not win a game until gameweek 10 Southampton need to act Chris I think oh I tell him this all the time he gets on a call with me and I tell him that I think that they're they are playing championship football in their no Stadium I'm convinced of it there you go heard it here uh Bob asks Captain this week har what what's your opinion on Harland against Salah I think plan FPL which is our premium planning tool um has them both on 7.7 points if I had them both I'd go Salah because of the up because of the extra points for midfielders and I prefer the fixture but I don't so I'm going Harden so just so to be clear you have Harland and not Salah but you Captain Salah and I have I have Salah and not Harland and I captain Harland should we off yeah if I had Salah this week I would I would absolutely give him the Unbound I yeah Forest data is really good aren't they the third best defense so far they are but and last season they were good as well it's Liverpool at home in in incredible form he's on pens I know Haren is too he gets an extra point for the goals cuz he's a midfielder he's got the potential for the clean sheet Point as well things that har like I could I think it'll be tight between the two of them but I wouldn't be surprised if Salah just Pips harand this week fair enough well yeah so it seems like we should swap teams no because I don't want all these Chelsea players that you've got yeah yeah no that's fair how many have you got just Palmer and Jackson for two he's pretty smart attacking double up for the fixtures don't really mind it to be fair it was Jackson or havitz which yeah I probably should have picked havit in hindsight to I'm only really winding you up because I actually do quite like the Jackson pick I just like winding you up about Chelsea and obviously everyone Palmer's a h I know she's HR as well and pal is a good pick as well to be fair you love it you know I'm gonna give you grief about Chelsea in the same way that you were about Spurs and we just live R free in your head yeah you do sometimes um yeah next question uh we'll do a couple more is Henderson still the best for and half keeper no you don't yeah I mean I hate owning him I'd have fleen I I switched to flein last week on world card and he lost his clean sheet in the 96th minute just okay hear me out because I you don't want fleing this week well no you don't okay bear with me because I appreciate that I do this on q&as and I I do appreciate I'm going to go in on itwi again but I quite like the mic I me if you think they're getting seven clean sheets in 13 games you should have right exactly so I might that's where another option when I want to change my goalkeeper like fleen I think is the better long-term 4.5 pick in terms of hendo or fleen but obviously this week it's difficult um but then from game week six you've got a nice one where I would see some clean sheets there Mich honestly think if I was wild carding right now and I want 4.5 that's who I would have yeah I don't necessarily disagree um I went for they're not going to keep many sheets the 4.5s right so you just pick the one that's got the best fixtures and the more chance of clean sheets so but look if going to get six yeah I don't think Palace are bad all of a sudden though like now the transfer window shut I expect them to settle down a bit they've signed chalar him gayi is a is a pretty solid Center back pairing I quite like so part of the reason for not want into to Wild Card at the moment is because I actually don't mind Hendon for the next three leester Manchester United Everton like I'm quite happy to have him for those three but after that I'd like to change him and that coincides you have to go M you can't not go Miran yeah well it's either that or or go up to Ry and have double yeah that's what Brian's saying no one is the best four and a half keeper there isn't really a standout M has got the best fixtures fleen has got a nice run penderson is probably the nicest for the next three weeks yeah um so depending upon when you're wild carding and how you're acting those are the three best options it's just how longterm you need to go with them but if you can afford reyer then Raya is clearly the best goalkeeper option in my opinion right now yeah yeah I was tempted by R and Ward but I just couldn't make it work no the budget thing right I get it but Mich I think is who I would be on right now if I was warding yeah right we'll do one more question I'm just trying to find a good one uh can it be one I don't have to give an I switch answer to yeah who's the best team to Triple up on IP switch IP switch while I find a question what are you doing this week arm what's your transfer I am so I have been waiting all this time because if zaka got injured on International Duty then I was going to do sacka to Salah but I don't want to lose sacka if he's going to play against birds of the weekend so the plan this week is to do gardial to Trent um I am tempted to just do Barco to Trent and hold vardal but I'd rather keep the budget in the bank and then know I can use that next week for upgrades elsewhere so yeah V to Trent is going to be yeah uh there's a couple of quick fire ones well Beck or J Pedro I think we said well back didn't we just for the minutes uh especially if you're going for two weeks mhm uh please choose two out of these three mad way Smith row Rogers you'd bench Smith row I think who film got West Ham at home West Ham yeah think I'd agree with that yeah and here you can um you can shout out your favorite Defender again who should I replace Barco with should I switch to Michael Kean I've teed you off on Everton there go in on Everton again I don't think they're going to keep it clean sheet until game week 10 I mean ke Keen is four though so maybe that's the thing like Greaves then Greaves good yeah good job yeah if you've got four go Greaves okay yeah I agree with that because I did that on Wild Card uh two more quick ones bench Jacob Murphy or Pedro porro it's got to be Murphy because he didn't start the last game surely you got to play porro if you've paid that money for porro he's going to basically camp on the edge of the Arsenal box five shots last week yeah yeah he has said he only has four million in which case yeah I'd go for an N switch guy gaves yeah and then final question uh is sbos the best seven and a half mid we didn't actually mention him before but with Harvey ell Elliot's injury his minutes look pretty secure and if you can't afford Diaz or J but then I guess it's actually question would you get Rob and B yeah possibly but if you want a triple up would you go for Robertson or saos Robertson robon yeah I think I agree with that because you got clean sheets and attack and returns h but it's a good differential I don't get me wrong I don't dislike the saos pick but I think if I had that much money I'd go for an emomo or an e right now like e for the next couple and then embo afterwards feels really cool and then you could travel up on Liverpool by game yeah definitely uh yeah so we've covered loads there we will wrap it up we've been going nearly an hour um as will should be back next week possibly I was saying that he who knows yeah is away at some point but I don't know when it is exactly and he might not miss a Wednesday to be fair he might be on a long weekend thing yeah I

mates um cuz it's a really good format there's a live chat a really nice graphic that shows you all the picks as it comes around um and you've obviously got watch list functions as well so yeah so when it gets down to the drags you can um you don't have to panic too much even though I did but yeah so yeah uh thanks a lot guys make sure to like And subscribe and best of luck for game week four bye guys [Music],10001,good afternoon what is going on everybody and welcome to your game we 4 fpl qa no a is not shaved off his beard he cant make it this week because hes been called in for work so ive had to step in after burning questions yesterday but im joined by sam as usual sam how are you doing im well thank you tom like once more into the breach for you this week another video i know i know i need to step up for ours this week itll be fine we just replace as with you and im sure that therell be no chelsea biased in the same way that theres no brighton biased either from as when hes on here and itll be great we dont seem to have to get a consistent qa team like i missed one so we had andy step in then we got back together for a week now hes off and weve got you in its like a merry go round in here well its good to get a different perspectives anyway had a good chat with harry yesterday on burning questions because i dont have harland and he does so i know you have harland as well youre a crazy man well well see well see anyway before we get into this video we need to have a quick message for our sponsors and that sleeper this week do get your questions in while we chat about sleeper for a few minutes and then well get into answering your questions so so sleeper weve teamed up with sleeper this year as well as the pickham league which is the predictions competition with great prizes they also have a great draft game on their app which we as a core team at scout got involved in with last week where we did our draft as you can see on screen we had a 10 person draft and it was great fun it was something new for me cu i never done a draft before but i picked last so i wasnt the best but how do you think it went and did you enjoy it it surprised me how many of the core team hadnt played a draft version of the game before because ive played it a few times like alzy and i did a draft together years ago when fpl first launched their draft game and i enjoyed playing i always have a draft team every year and this year ive ive now got three sleeper drafts one with you guys in the core team one and the draft of legends with all the fpl content creators that sleeper have been posting about and then another one that im doing with some of my patrons and i love it the sleeper app because i think the thing that it does the other fpl draft games that ive played in the past doesnt do is it gives you a rating for your team and suggest whether youre lik to win or lose and by how much buy it gives you the predicted points that the players that you have in your team are likely to get and you can make your judgments based on that you also have the ability to move players in and out before they kick the ball before their game kicks off so that you can avoid them if they arent starting that week but i think when you have a 10 person draft it is hard and i felt for you having last pick when we did it because i had last pick in the draft of legends i picked his first player as well for you i know went straight in with a spurs pick i l that and i think does make you think slightly differently depending upon what position youre in because if you get first pick like mark had in our league you then dont get to pick again until pick 20 and by the time you get there and youve had 19 other players disappear youre in a very different spot whereas for you have the backtoback picks of 10th and 11th and then again so you have to think a bit more strategically about the players that are likely to start but if you havent done one it genuinely is good fun we did our slightly differently we all got on a zoom call and laughed at each other mostly at chris for picking everton players or not picking everton players as the case may be but theres something fun about doing a draft league and talking to each other as youre doing it but the chat function in the app if you cant be together is also brilliant so like the sleeper stuff for sure do check that out theres a link in the description to join our pick him league which again is just a simple free predictions competition with some great prizes and then theres also a link to download the app and make your own draft league as well so stay tuned for more content on scout about our draft see who does what and who manages to win it im not too confident looking at my squad but maybe reese james will come back to fitness and give me a chance youre laughing at that i love the reese james pick particularly when you accidentally managed to drop him and then had to wait for him to come back into your team so do check out that those links in the description and now we will get into the questions so lets start with this question which is saka to salah and quanza to le dunk for free how do you feel about that theres a lot of people i think that are going to be thinking about doing sacka to salah this week and if you purely base it on fixtures you can completely understand why people would do it right it enables you to hit two nice fixtures on paper for salah and at the same time avoid probably two of the hardest fixtures maybe even the two hardest fixtures that arsenal have this year with man city away but also like the northland and derby although theyve they tend to do quite well when they come to us its a difficult fixture because of the emotional stuff that goes alongside the north london derby so if you can avoid it then i can see why some people would i think for me the big thing though is this is selling sacka because come game week six when the arsenal fixtures massively shift for the better youre then going to be wanting to get sacka back so its just working out whether its worth that in taking the hit to bring them in maybe having to take a hit again to swap it and presumably by the time game week six rolls around you wont want to sell salah so then its finding some other way to get to get sacka back into your team i can afford to do this week ive got enough money in the bank to just go straight from sacka up to salah but i dont want to sacas record against b is ridiculous he got 25 points against us last season more than he got against any other side defensively spurs have always got at least one moment in them of nonsense definitely probably multiple moments of nonsense during the course of this game and yes well attack and we will see the injuries and the suspensions at arsenal as an opportunity and probably be more attacking as a result of that but i do worry i do worry a little bit about as a spurs fan about sacas ability to score against us and without erard do we see hav dro in the mid if we see hav dropp in the mid do we see sacka push up top do we see sterling therefore playing sacas position or do we see sterling go up top and zaka stay where he is whatever happens i think zaka has the potential for this to be a good game week so sell him actual peril i think would be would be my advice i dont mind it if its for free its just that harland doesnt have harland has such has a good fixture this week which complicates it like if salah was massively the best captain it would be more obvious but you can probably get away with it i think without having salah this week and then the second part of that question was quan to dunk i like that ive got l dunk so thats probably why i like it ill be starting him this week if switch at home i think brightons defenses look good under the new manager for brins back now so but dont you only like it until game week six because you get the fixture ticket from game week six to gw 16 and brighton a second bottom only southampt for defense and brighton its only southampton that have got a worst defensive run after six so you get dunk for the next two weeks but then after that do you want him like i think if i was going to it depends who else you have i got dunk because i needed cover for this week with gabrielle that may be what hes thinking i think i would id rather have like an itswitch defender go for leaf davis or a gr greaves or somebody like that i think because that you get more longterm longevity out of them and you have to play them every week presumably theyre not going to be your first choice defender so if theyre replacing quanza then you can play around with it a little bit more i think i think id prefer somebody like that over dunk fair enough we had another question would you bench embo or coner coner limped off for england but the england manager said it wasnt too bad but as human concert is all right who would you be playing the defender or the attacker im benching boo this week by are you well the plan was always to play rogers so its slightly different to the question but i general rule of life for me is always back the attack so if im torn between a defender and an attacker ill always play the attacker over the defender simply because i think you get more upside potential out of your attacking option and particularly as we havent seen man city being solid defensively this season like i do think that in the next two weeks it looks tough right man city and then spurs for brenford but with the way that brenford play and particularly the way that m buo has been playing i do think that he could score in both of those fixtures do i think but kza gets if he starts it isnt if he starts then i would expect a clean sheet in that fixture because its everton and theyve been shocking however asena defensively havent set the world on fire themselves either so i think id play ando this week i do i thinking you though isnt it six points yes youre not getting any more than six for cona because you would expect that aston villa score goals in that game and therefore youd expect it to be the attackers that would pick up the bonus points the flip side is coner is not going to come on if hes not starting you wouldnt have thought so thats true you theres a good chance you end up with in boore anyway but i think id play the attacker you saw against dip switch man city conceded one they conceded last week didnt they to west ham as well so they tend to concede one so i think were both agreed on emo there next question pick two of salanki rogers or smith row now you were saying before the stream you think sank is going to be back i he be back but well have to see what posts got to say the good thing about posta kogu is he will tell you the truth so if sank is available hell tell you if sank is not available hell tell you i think from what im ive been hearing he and vaner will both be available for the weekend which is massive from a spurs perspective so who were the other two rogers and smith row so thats west ham at home for smith row and everton at home for rogers i think you got to play rogers personally you have to play rogers you absolutely have to play rogers i think the thing with salanki is hes either starting problem is its going to be hell give you he will give you the answer tomorrow b k ifan is gonna start id start him over smith roow i agree with that i just think with the amount of chances that we will create he you have to back him to convert something in his first north london derby at home in front of the fans as well because he hasnt made a home game yet his only game was away at leicester so this will be his first game for us in the tottenham stadium i smith r has not started the season hugely well either so i think id have to bench him i think rogers is interesting because his data is poor and i think hes like if he blanks this week i think peoples opinions might start shifting a bit on him because hes playing well but hes not getting points and his expected goal involvement is quite low compared particular with the champions league then kicking off as well just on that salanki youre bigging up salanki so whats your opinion on arsenal defenders this week because im currently benching gabrielle for robinson because i think spurs will score i was saying terry yesterday like if he gave me five quid id put it on to spurs on both teams to score because that seems youd be pretty silly to f against that so score scores for both sides normally i would back the arsenal defense to keep a clean sheet but genuinely the i think the way that we play knowing we wont keep a clean sheet we will go we will just attack it will be attack and i just cant see that we dont score in that one so if youve got the thing with gabrielle is that hes always got that element of attacking threat like ive got celba my conversation is around him because his likelihood of an attacking return is maybe less than gabrielles and so maybe theres a bigger conversation to be had there but with gabrielle theres always that attacking threat so like ive got porro ill start him even though i dont think hell clean she and i think id feel the same about gabrielle but equally if its a conversation between starting gabrielle or starting robinson then i think you have to look at starting robinson because hes got more likelihood of an attacking well probably got a similar likelihood of an attacking threat but more likelihood of a clean sheet this weekend so his upside is maybe greater than gabrielles harry said it on burning questions harry said it was obvious and he was deciding between parro and gabrielle and he was always going to play robinson which i thought was interesting because i wouldnt be benching parro to be honest against anyone i dont think you can porro i think if its a choice between gabrielle and porro you play porro because the attacking threat is so mucher for him although as british 87 says in the chat bench gabriel app perel that bullet that hes going to score that bullet header but its the same with any premium asset right and i said it on the official pod this week if youve if youve listened to that or watched that on youtube i think if you if you have a player like porro like trent like bardal like any of those expensive defenders gabrielle sba ben white and you decide to play the fixtures and bench them you have the risk of one they could still clean sheet in that game and two theyve got attacking upside thats why theyre so expensive so theres always an element of risk particularly if youre benching one of them to play a 45 or 46 now defender but i think you do have to play the upside of potential points returns and wheres the ceiling and i do think at arsenal its unlikely that gabrielle gets a clean sheet and an attacking return he might get one and i would if i was going to suggest he gets anything itll be a goal i just dont see him clean sheet in against us i might be wrong but i cant see it harry said in the chat he benched gabrielle for several goals last season so dont listen to him there you go harry we had a couple super chats which we should get to but go on sam sorry no i was just going to say im hoping he does nothing im he gets two points youre going to that game aren im going to that game and last year tom do you remember every time i went to the games it went absolutely horribly wrong so this year im hoping that we dont have the same problems so captain your arsenal players thats what youre saying gosh i hope not all right we got a couple of super chats which well do first of all from davis family which they are asking le hold they saying so three free transfers thats the context one move of leis hall to luca dean for the next vills next two fixtures or a double move of xia of chris wood to xia pedro which would fund lewis hall up to rico lewis i just quickly say that weve had press conference today and chris wood got back late from international duty so nuno said he has to assess him and so did j pedro but the brighton manager was a bit more confident on sha pedro he said that hell be in the squad as long as he recovers so what do you think about that do you think luca deans a good punt for two weeks im always a bit wary of luca de because like i was worst last season why when moreno was there as well because you never knew who was going to get the nod who was going to start and i do worry about rotation with him and particularly around the champions league like you bring in a player that could potentially and not start in one of the games i think id prefer pal torres of the aston villa defenders like i just think youre a bit more safe there so i think if i was going to do it i would do that i think i would i like this move i like these i like the double move if you want to pump rico lewis i think rico lewis is like it depends what type of manage you are i wouldnt do it just because i think he might get benched but if you want to take the risk is it could pay off but i would probably get well back over jaia pedro if youre targeting these next two weeks because like theyre both theyre probably both going to start twice but you would think jel pedros got an early sub this weekend with heavy legs well he doesnt start him at all this week and brings him off the bench if needed well beck state is better this year it is and i think he could he has got other players he can play in the j pedro position so i would do the same i think i would bring well back in this week the rico lewis thing i am i dont like it but some people do lee and i fundamentally disagree on this because he thinks its like an nob brainer to have rico lewis and i just think rico lewis has got benching written all over him at some point like no there is absolutely no way i think the car walker stays on the bench all season for rico lewis to start every game i just dont see it happening now yes it could be that kyl walker starts in the champions league and rico lewis starts in the premier league thats possible but we dont know that yet and i just feel like i dont trust man city to keep a clean sheet in any game ever because they have theyre a bit spursy from the defensive perspective like they do like to let go a goal and wipe out the clean sheet and by the way im not just talking about the last two week this is like a long thing like last season i had vardal and vardal was it was an exception though because the clean sheet would go youd feel frustrated but then youd get an attack in return and youd feel better about it so it was okay whereas with reo lewis like hes definitely got the attacking threat and could absolutely get some attacking returns but for me im not the manager that wants to take a risk on players starting particularly defenders like i want my defenders to be as close to guaranteed starters every week because you dont want your hes probably going to be in there in your like what third or maybe fourth defender slots and i just think you dont want to be getting too low down so for me i dont i dont like rico lewis but i know a lot of people do so i know im im in the minority probably i think i think if youre well cing game week six if youre set on that i id go for rico lewis so thats probably where i stand on that and then the second super chat we had i dont think theres a question but feel free to drop one in and we can pick it up but it just says hi thomas hope you both well tripled up on liverpool with my world card jackson and j pedra also coming in and hoping to improve on 129k well i wish i was 129k thats incredible its a good start to the season that is and tribling up on liverpool this week is a place that i wish i could get like i can double up to treble up id have to take a hit and im not necessarily opposed to taking a hit i just think that i just dont want to because the players that id be taking out i think could easily return as well this week its i think its a tough moment for managers at the minute because you either youve either just wild carded like you and then youre thinking about can i just roll through it can i wait a few weeks that i can make my changes ahead of six because the wild card team maybe isnt perfect for six or youre wild carding now and trying to build a team that works for now and six or youre trying to do what im doing and thats just be calm and not panic and then ride it through but in doing that not take too many hits but keep up with the people that have just wild carded its fascinating i think at the minute and so if youre already at that rank then youre doing a sterling job so and i love the jackson pick as well hes he was on my world card last week he scored golden assist no hes hes just a good player getting points as far as im concerned is he i think hes second for forwards expected goal involvement as well good fixtures i like him hes a good player hes a good pick there you go jackson i dont know i just dont trust him i just dont trust him thats the problem like weve seen him before right and he reminds me so much in some way some ways of darwin like load of shots tar numbers they mark better but i dont know i dont know how i feel about it am i might be that in two game weeks time i feel differently and on wild cut the fixtures are there the fixtures are definitely there i just i dont know how i feel about chelsea generally to be honest tom well score lots of goals we might concede a few thats how i feel probably right a bit like spurs then it sounds like do you reckon you score more goals than us this season maybe we got a bit of a head start now after we got six we got four against everton fair enough we havent played them yet thats true we play ballshit no i think well be battling out for fourth i know you disagreed but vill newcastle man united i dont see why we cant compete with them okay youre so not convinced on chelsea not lets lets bring it back from chelsea well by talking about how in kungu is such a rubbish pick and i was so wrong on that sam asks what you do in kungu to garnacho yes i would doing kingu to gar gacho though is he the best mid prize mid mad way no i think mada is quite a good bet i dont hate having just said all that about chelsea i dont hate the mada pick i dont i think hes the right option hell keep starting exactly and got a return for england i know it doesnt count in fpl but has continued to have some form for england as well when he came on is garnacho the best pick i think hes a good pick like southampton this week because its southampton this week moma as well someones mentioned in the chat i like that and i like the mina pick as well i also like the seeno pick and all of these guys are cheaper and save your budget so depending upon what youre trying to achieve with the rest of your team going in for a mina a matoma or seena youve youve got options in that price point i like the seena pick like if i was i know theyve got you l so you probably disagree with me but i like attack against is never a bad idea no and i like him as an option moving forward as well but i do like the gache pick weirdly i just think if anyones going to score from man united its likely to involve him e leester at home is he seven no hes a bit more expensive isnt he you got youve got to have a bit more because hes 69 i think so but if youve got that extra bit more then you can go there or if youve got a little bit more again go foro at 71 i think i prefer moma to gacho thats my opinion also on and kungu i will just say if youre selling him for a hit i think there is a chance he starts this week because i dont think netto will play because hes played twice for portugal and moresa said hes managing his minutes and he cant play twice in a week so i think either enu or sancho will start on the left this weekend but i would i still wouldnt recommend keeping inu but if its for a hit i might just ch i maybe just chance it i think if quicker you can get rid of an kinki the better to be honest thats probably fair who was picking up before the season i cant remember all of us i think i was definitely youre the problem i am i owe a lot of people apologies for that i started with him i attacked him off early quickly like i think rogers onana at aston villa if you dont have them and want to play their fixes by not having watkins go cheaper there trial rate as well at fm decent option so i think i like and you like gacho so one of those two probably next question start gordon or rogers gordon is away at wolves and rogers is everton at home you have to start rogers i think do you think is there no one else you can bench we have this a lot people are like and i go cant we just bench somebody else just like invent some other random player id bench rogerss data is poor for sure gordon is like gordons almost an elite asset like hes so consistent and rogers hasnt gotten a return this season an elite asset its like at being on here with as this is in his generational talents benching gordon at all i would not bench gordon no what we were just saying that wolf ship six mad scored a hat trick from the right wing which is where gordon will probably be playing if barnes plays id start gordon every day we disagree then because i think i dont i dont think you can bench somebody against everton they are so bad they are so bad i think you have to play that fixture why have you got rogers if youre not going to play him against everton i so but then why have you got gordon if youre not going to play him at all cuz hes like 75 i reckon points i reckon the rate my team would favor gordon but the fixture bran weights not back is he so everton are probably going to be just as bad everton are going to be terrible but i dont think they can defend and surely viller have got the attacking threat i think you have to play rogers i get what youre saying about gordon i wouldnt want to bench him either id find another way to not bench him bench another player bench gabrielle instead or cra or i dont know but there must be somebody else you could bench drop your team in the chat ill tell you if theres another player you can bench cool the next question best time to world card outside of game week four and six cuz this could be your strategy g maybe and then marcus adds his game week seven a good time well whats difference between six and seven its harland has fullam at home doesnt he so if you dont have harland that could be a reason to world card in seven im just looking at the fixture ticker and wheres it international break in between seven and eight have we got next international break ill check you keep talking ill check i think that might be the next international break like looking at the fixture ticket i think the only major difference between a wild card in six and a wild card in seven is man city brighton are in the middle of a pretty awful run yes its eight is the break se after seven is the break after seven i dont think theres enough difference between what the team youd create for a wild card in six to a team youd create for a wild card in seven to not like if you dont have but i just dont think theres enough in it like i think you could wild card in six and get harlem for newcastle like i dont think theres enough in the changes that you would make like you theres much bigger gain to be had world carding in six with arsenal and players like that so waiting one week just to avoid harlem playing newcastle doesnt make a lot of sense to me im looking at potentially 12 as a wild card window but quite like that i dont mind the world card in the intern next international break i dont i dont mind that at all because then youre what seven game weeks into it youve got good understanding its two weeks of opportunity the question i have about game week a is how much would i change in my team like in terms of fixtures i dont think theres enough change to make big changes but there would be in terms of form of players potentially and it would be probably more changing around the edges like spurs would avoid the man united game if you were wild carded in seven but i dont i think gw 12 potentially is where im looking might i dont i dont know is my honest answer its probably going to be eight or 12 for me i think if youre not set on doing it in six then youve got some arsenal players id imagine ive got two i im talking more in general but like thats probably you wouldnt work card in six if you had already triple arsenal so no exactly and i think by the time six rolls in i could easily have triple arsenal without needing to wild card and the other players that im invested in i would still have so its bren possibly as well you i think if you wild card in six if youre a little bit short of arsenal and if you havent gotten br or vissa without hits i id say id agree with that and then har for seven and nine you probably need i say that as a nonowner but are you planning to get him in well yes in short yes but in game week 7 well see because palmer has brighton or forest one of the two at home and sacka has leicester at home so theres a chance i could go against holland that week but then in game week nine for southampton at home then hell definitely be coming in so what youll sell palmer palmer will be going salah to saka in six and then watkins salah zaka in six for lester and southampton i get that but you dont even have sal now no i know but i need i need the money somehow dont i need the money and i want to keep i think i want to keep trent that is the thing and that is that is the point isnt it is that you cant have everybody this year so like ive got saaka where youve got salah youre doing a bit of a hokey koke with saka and salah and you salah in and then you swap them back and then and then youll hokey cokey around with palmer and haren you taken haren out for palmer and then you swwa them back again later right thats what im doing this year just chasing the fixtures chase the fixtures it makes sense and i think if youre chasing the fixtures then get the best captain every week and chase the fixtures if youre chasing the fixtures then six is the next best moment and after that its probably 12 well stay tuned to the site because if sam is wild carding in 12 shell definitely be writing about that and thats interesting i havent thought about a 12 wild card yet next question from heather bench one of trior watkins or esack trior reluctantly but i think you have to i think you have to you got two penalties i think watkins will be on penalties i reckon hes so desperate for a goal theres no way he doesnt take one if they get it this weekend wow do you not can take it well he scored for england didnt he under 21s i think hell take it i no i dont think that he surely hes too junior hes not going to be able to pull rank and get a penalty off watkins does watkins want them didnt want one for england true was he on for shoot out i well i heard a malicious rumor it might be a malicious rumor allegedly you need to allegedly that because there was that video wasnt there of trent saying he didnt want it yes and that was supposedly about watkins so if he doesnt if he doesnt want one for england different pressure though world euro shoot of course and it might not have even been about him it might just be people nonsensing up i cant even remember fim was on the pitch at that point i think he was but i dont know like he didnt take it all of last season and i know they had douglas louise but if hes their striker tans people saying in the chat theres tans as well thats a good point were not going to know until we get one but i just think hes missed like four sitters hes going to be so desperate for a goal especially if theyre winning if theyre winning two nil it wouldnt shock me if watkins took it it wouldnt surprise me either but i just think theyve got other options i wouldnt guarantee watkins to be their penalty take heres a question from craig hes asking is it worth doing concert or robinson to robertson for two or three weeks or roll the transfer i think i think its not a bad idea to target these two games for liverpool especially as he says he wants to wild card in six or seven if you want a wild card in six or seven then i would 100 do conza to robertson this week and target liverpool because i dont think like i appreciate that is everton this week and then its wolves but would it s would it shock you if they dont keep a clean sheet astonvilla defensively havent been great well no they only kept nine last year when they came fourth theyre not the best ofans no and they and id say theyre even weaker this year than they were last year and i appreciate that weve already got three fixtures worth of data to go on there who was the other ones robin what coner or robinson i dont i would feel robinsons got worse fixtures west newcastle but i would prefer to have him in my team for the attacking but i would do conza absolutely would do con to robertson and have triple liverpool i agree how this slightly unprofessional but how long do you usually go for maybe like 10 more minutes im just i dont how long does i we normally do about 50 minutes but we can do 55 if you like i well keep going then lots of more questions so what we got steve saying sell youll like this or maybe not sell sun to salah for a hit before you come in with spurs i would not do it unless you were captaining sala this week because weve both said we think arsenal are going to concede and hes on pen hes on pens well is he still on pens if s is on the pit pitch we dont know that yet no we dont or he could be up front if sank is not on the pitch but he could be up front if sank is not on the pitch hes got good record in recent times against arsenal for a you dont surely you dont take sun out for a hit you cant i dont think you can minus if it was for free id be tempted but its two home games for spurs its the home north london derby and against an arsenal team that are weaker without rice and ard and then its brenford at home who we always seem to score twice against they quite often score against us but we always seem to get a couple against them so i would expect sun to be in those as well i dont think you can i dont think you can hit sun out if you dont have harland which would be a surprise because most people have one of harland or salah but if you did need a captain i think you do the hit i wouldnt be against that but if youve got harand sitting there with the arm band i wouldnt do it i think i would agree with that definitely this is more of a statement but leaf davis is the best 45 defender i think you agree with that i dont disagree with that ive been talking about him all summer and then stupidly didnt get him in my team for game week one i dont know why but he will be a player that ill be looking at in the next couple of weeks i just think he makes absolute sense if you dont have the0 five and you want to go for grieves them fine because it switches like the fact that it switched it top of the fixture ticker from i think its genuinely from now until 16 from now until gw 16 they set top of the ticket they got one red fixture in there its against spurs in 11 like you a nip switch defender makes a whole world of sense and i like clee davis for his attacking threat i i think i agree but i wouldnt like they are rip switch and theyre not going to keep many clean sheets like right hampton villa west ham everton brenford leicester toten man united and forest palace bournemouth wolves thats in the next four six eight 10 12 13 weeks i reckon theres one two three four five or six clean sheets in there in how many games 13 one and two thats golden glove levels southampton everton leicester but what were talking about switch not arsenal but ip switch has started the season way better than any of them three i think theyll cle sheet against all three of them fair enough sounds like you should be buying leaf davis i will be at some point i just got ive got to stop using my transfers bringing in trent so i can do barco to leaf davis thats what i want to do thats what i should have started the season with i dont know why i didnt silly cool next question from gabrielle or gabriel which sorry if thats the wrong one is it is it the gabrielle is he moaning that were benching in this week imagine if it was hes saying hes got a bullet header coming yes hes like im going to bullet header in against this sell smith road to lis diaz for a hit i would i think i think leis diaz has been in unreal form only har get 90 minutes twice that is a very fair point i think we have to wait for slot because if it was klopp he wouldnt start him this week but its not klopp anymore its slot having said that having said i just do it i wouldnt do it because ive just g game was very i think will tuesday night at 930 they were saying it was hot like mascara got stretched off a heat stroke they were saying so and hes played 2 90 minutes has he y i maybe not for a hit then because smith row west ham at home smith row could get something its going to be listen to slot tomorrow if slot says im starting leis diaz if or if slot says something like i dont care about their international exploits their profession they can play then i probably would do it because i think the fixtures for liverpool for the next couple of well arguably for the next five including the chelsey game sorry tom in eight i think a nice so you could bring him in and keep him and that hit then isnt four points this week its spread over five we period which feels much better but if slot says anything like im wary of were going to have to assess how theyve come back and all that jazz then just be mindful of it so someone fpl onions is saying sam if you believe that youd get three times i switch defense for 13m i there is a very big possibility that i get double lip switch defense in the next couple of weeks i have greaves on my bench to be fair i honestly think that i can see myself having gves and leaf davis in the next two or three weeks backing i switch big thats its a bit mad isnt it i also quite like to lap up top as well might go all in on it switch do you think theyll get relegated this year i think theres currently three worst teams in the league southampton leicester and everton will be everton will win one nil at home after christmas and be fine when bran weight comes back theyll be fine in my opinion i think they lose this weekend against villa i think they lose against leicester i think theyll lose against palace newcastle they lose against them they lose against dip switch they wont lose their first eight games i think they might not theyll get a point they might not win a game until gw 10 southampton need to act chris i think i tell him this all the time he gets on a call with me and i tell him that i think that theyre they are playing championship football in their no stadium im convinced of it there you go heard it here bob asks captain this week har whats your opinion on harland against salah i think plan fpl which is our premium planning tool has them both on 77 points if i had them both id go salah because of the up because of the extra points for midfielders and i prefer the fixture but i dont so im going harden so just so to be clear you have harland and not salah but you captain salah and i have i have salah and not harland and i captain harland should we off if i had salah this week i would i would absolutely give him the unbound i forest data is good arent they the third best defense so far they are but and last season they were good as well its liverpool at home in incredible form hes on pens i know haren is too he gets an extra point for the goals cuz hes a midfielder hes got the potential for the clean sheet point as well things that har like i could i think itll be tight between the two of them but i wouldnt be surprised if salah just pips harand this week fair enough well so it seems like we should swap teams no because i dont want all these chelsea players that youve got no thats fair how many have you got just palmer and jackson for two hes pretty smart attacking double up for the fixtures dont mind it to be fair it was jackson or havitz which i probably should have picked havit in hindsight to im only winding you up because i do quite like the jackson pick i just like winding you up about chelsea and everyone palmers a h i know shes hr as well and pal is a good pick as well to be fair you love it im gonna give you grief about chelsea in the same way that you were about spurs and we just live r free in your head you do sometimes next question well do a couple more is henderson still the best for and half keeper no you dont i hate owning him id have fleen i switched to flein last week on world card and he lost his clean sheet in the 96th minute just okay hear me out because i you dont want fleing this week well no you dont okay bear with me because i appreciate that i do this on qas and i do appreciate im going to go in on itwi again but i quite like the mic i me if you think theyre getting seven clean sheets in 13 games you should have right exactly so i might thats where another option when i want to change my goalkeeper like fleen i think is the better longterm 45 pick in terms of hendo or fleen but this week its difficult but then from game week six youve got a nice one where i would see some clean sheets there mich honestly think if i was wild carding right now and i want 45 thats who i would have i dont necessarily disagree i went for theyre not going to keep many sheets the 45s right so you just pick the one thats got the best fixtures and the more chance of clean sheets so but look if going to get six i dont think palace are bad all of a sudden though like now the transfer window shut i expect them to settle down a bit theyve signed chalar him gayi is a is a pretty solid center back pairing i quite like so part of the reason for not want into to wild card at the moment is because i dont mind hendon for the next three leester man utd everton like im quite happy to have him for those three but after that id like to change him and that coincides you have to go m you cant not go miran well its either that or go up to ry and have double thats what brians saying no one is the best four and a half keeper there isnt a standout m has got the best fixtures fleen has got a nice run penderson is probably the nicest for the next three weeks so depending upon when youre wild carding and how youre acting those are the three best options its just how longterm you need to go with them but if you can afford reyer then raya is clearly the best goalkeeper option in my opinion right now i was tempted by r and ward but i just couldnt make it work no the budget thing right i get it but mich i think is who i would be on right now if i was warding right well do one more question im just trying to find a good one can it be one i dont have to give an i switch answer to whos the best team to triple up on ip switch ip switch while i find a question what are you doing this week arm whats your transfer i am so i have been waiting all this time because if zaka got injured on international duty then i was going to do sacka to salah but i dont want to lose sacka if hes going to play against birds of the weekend so the plan this week is to do gardial to trent i am tempted to just do barco to trent and hold vardal but id rather keep the budget in the bank and then know i can use that next week for upgrades elsewhere so v to trent is going to be theres a couple of quick fire ones well beck or j pedro i think we said well back didnt we just for the minutes especially if youre going for two weeks mhm please choose two out of these three mad way smith row rogers youd bench smith row i think who film got west ham at home west ham think id agree with that and here you can you can shout out your favorite defender again who should i replace barco with should i switch to michael kean ive teed you off on everton there go in on everton again i dont think theyre going to keep it clean sheet until game week 10 ke keen is four though so maybe thats the thing like greaves then greaves good good job if youve got four go greaves okay i agree with that because i did that on wild card two more quick ones bench jacob murphy or pedro porro its got to be murphy because he didnt start the last game surely you got to play porro if youve paid that money for porro hes going to camp on the edge of the arsenal box five shots last week he has said he only has four million in which case id go for an n switch guy gaves and then final question is sbos the best seven and a half mid we didnt mention him before but with harvey ell elliots injury his minutes look pretty secure and if you cant afford diaz or j but then its question would you get rob and b possibly but if you want a triple up would you go for robertson or saos robertson robon i think i agree with that because you got clean sheets and attack and returns h but its a good differential i dont get me wrong i dont dislike the saos pick but i think if i had that much money id go for an emomo or an e right now like e for the next couple and then embo afterwards feels cool and then you could travel up on liverpool by game definitely so weve covered loads there we will wrap it up weve been going nearly an hour as will should be back next week possibly i was saying that he who knows is away at some point but i dont know when it is exactly and he might not miss a wednesday to be fair he might be on a long weekend thing i cant remember so do stay tuned please give us a like please subscribe stay tuned for the channel

15,AboveAverageFPL,vqDCHu7ctdE,FPL GW4 Wildcard Team Selection | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-09-12T21:17:58Z,"[Music] n [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always I'm joined by Baker hello how you doing mate you're right football's back football is back International break is over and we're buzzing it's an interesting weekend for us as well like we just have to go straight into the north London Derby like just flying into it try not to think try not to think about that yeah it do does feel I think it'll sort of hit home tomorrow when you got presses and stuff happening that's oh God it's north Spurs have released the Danny Rose goal already as Nostalgia like it's already started it's there yeah yeah we're starting to see a bit chat in our Spurs chats and stuff uh is uh we were just working through earlier that in the last four games we've managed to give away three own goals a penalty and a red card which is so bad like can you remember like 2018 when we were when remember 2018 when we used to go into these games being relatively confident yeah [ __ ] days are gone anyway how's your International break been mate yeah it's been pretty stressful actually work's been busy so I haven't really had time much time to focus I don't watch International Football anyway um I really have no interest in in uh in watching England in Nations League stuff obviously very interested in ogard getting injured um for Norway but uh you know that's that's about it I keep an eye on it through soare mainly just having players in there hyberg smashes it every International break like scores every time for Denmark yeah he must be like top goal scorer for them like in the history even like he must be close to like low Drop and that that sort of stuff now's he's at that level but yeah I don't really um I don't really don't really watch them so know no so I watch him sort of on the iPad I never put on the Telly just just have a little bit on it but it's it feels really quite it feels like a long break feels like the longest longest break and now B it's a big week this it's a huge week you're on wild card yes loads on Wild Card yeah I think they said there was like 700,000 activated or something like that I saw maybe earli on in the week but might be more than that by now loads and loads and loads huge oh bet P have a drink all right I've got here some uh Never Say Die bourbon from the good good people this is a uh one of the only Bourbons that's done in Kentucky and then brewed and then matured in England and they've kindly sent me some uh bottles I knew I drun whiskey long enough on this that somebody would uh would join in um and we will do some giveaways at some point for this but cheers Never Say Die whiskey yeah shout out to Never Say Die whiskey this is this my first drink in September I've I because I only people must see the whiskey and think I just drink all the time but I only really drink whiskey when I when I pod that's it but all right get the brand you is this is this the first sip or is this I've had it before but uh it's my first uh first at home and it is delightful I've been I've been on the golf course today I've had a few beers and stuff already um so I'm let go I'm drinking tea mate I'm on the tea now cuz I was I was exhausted I was exhausted but I had my best round of golf all year so we'll drink to that never said whiskey wait I want some gure or something like that amazing that is amazing right back to back footballall Wild Card talk me through wild card so you press the button just talk through like how how's it been couple of weeks there been I've been trying to stay away from looking at price changes there been lots of price changes there's been you know all the farming and been absolutely like no no no there's there's absolutely none of that like I when I said to when I said with the chat with Andy so if you haven't listened to the chat that we had with Andy on wild card go listen to that but I said that you know Sunday Monday was just like hectic because everyone was pushing buttons everyone was making transfers and then everyone just went oh yeah it's an international break let's just calm calm down a bit and like nobody's moved at all like there's been no no other movement so I don't know whether things are going to start to ramp up now that we've got you know 48 hours until the deadline type Vibes so maybe we look at tonight and see if there's anything that's going to move but I think I'm I'm past that we did have a little fun on the uh on the um I'm got 101 million team value a little bit earlier on in the week and then you just take all your players out and you end up with only 100 million in the bank to spend but um Ben Martin in the chat says throw the score out I'm assuming him 8 golf today what was the score today ah shot 77 so 77 playing off six net 71 one under yeah had a couple of finish with a birdie as well so it's always really really nice and what was worse is they'd actually just done full airation on the greens fully CED full of sand it was basically like playing on it like putting on a beach yeah I said about this you don't mind it when it lands on it mate and it's stopping stopping the balls and you're pitch into it people people don't mind it when it straightens your ball up but every time a part's missed on an air it green you're like yeah it's not my fault mate 45 degrees right on a three foot part just just it's just really anyway golf chat people get annoyed when with the golf chat but let's uh let's go so yeah so on so on W I mean I I have a do I have a small am ounce of regret maybe I'm just not comfortable with all the teams that I've been kind of looking at um and you know because I feel like I'm earmarking myself away from Harland because I think that's the right thing to do I feel like it's the right thing to do particularly over the next three weeks but getting him back in seven eight and the thought of not having him for Southampton is is is Weighing on my mind and if if I didn't hit the wild card I wouldn't have that concern like the brenford game is a good game for him you know obviously we've heard the news of his um his his friend passing so we don't know whether he's going to have any compassionate leave we such gohs that that they they you can see out there people are straight away honestly the stuff the stuff people will be like well he's definitely miss a game too well 15 9y old Mentor is an uncle to me you know people are already Imagining the celebration you know yeah yeah it's um we're awful people so we don't know whether he's going to be playing or not let's just let's just put it like that it doesn't I mean he's been training today yeah for the game so we should assume that he's going to play yeah yeah um so where was I so yeah so that's so no Harland is is the current kind of where I am yeah I think it's no Harland but I don't want to go away from I don't want to away from covering city as well because City's next Victory is obviously very good and then you can you can rotate around players to make like four uh five and six work um yeah five and six work and then then you get you just just fly back in for seven but again we've still got so much to see from when the Champions League starts yeah there's all that all that risk in front of us which is a little bit nerve-wracking and I feel like and so yeah so even more so I feel like not having the wild card now to react to that information coming up in a couple of weeks feels a bit uh but you have got free transfers I have got three transfers so I can react and I can maneuver but it feels like I can be less forthcoming on like planning for it so I have to be more reactive with my transfers which I guess is okay that's fine that's what that's what people who are wild carding maybe in six have been doing weeks one to three right so maybe we're all in the same place and we're all going to end up having a bit of crap you know dealing with stuff and that's just just what it is you know is is just just I would say look I'm very envious in terms of being in that position is is being on world card now is fantastic being on world card with transfers on hand is fantastic I think if I had transfers in hand I I think I probably would have wild carded this week and so I still think it's I think it's a really good week when we look at we'll look at Rob T's things but what another reason why it's you really want the first week to be a good week for it and there's some really good fixtures I mean Villa and Brighton there's a lot on them obviously Liverpool is Liverpool magnificent but um they could be Magnus forever you know um but Palace got a really good week if you haven't already got yourself involved in those ones there's loads Brighton so bright massive being on the old Xiao Pedro plane watch love that yeah oh yeah that's the other one everyone's got track planes um it's it's a really really good good week for it um I'm dreading this weekend um for it as somebody that that is in a really precarious position I would say I'm in where I've got where I've got no transfers not had any transfers at all at any point in the bank and if even if I played wild card I'd then be like Bo what I what angle do I go and and I could still end up playing wild card by by the time the deadline comes if there was news for example like a harand wasn't playing even I've got to look at Players like I've got players like jotter and what if he doesn't play um you know if they decide dar's going to going to play the game that's a difficult one so honestly it's a strong position wherever you go fair enough we can talk more about that later let's have a look at the games um before we do that actually hello to everyone in the YouTube chat and there is a product placement Central yeah yeah yeah well you know we get free whiskey we're going to tell them tell people about the free whiskey right you know that's not anyone wants to send us free stuff we will mention it yeah oh absolutely absolutely that is that is a guarantee um and so if you do like the work that we do you know make sure you drop a like on the video If you like this video and if you want to see more from us make sure you subscribe and the reason I say that is for a number of things so I also said we're going to do giveaway a little bit later um because oh yeah because this video I'm almost certain of this right I'm it's not 100% guaranteed but this video will take us over one million views on YouTube wow this like genuinely this is nuts like honestly um one million views one million views on YouTube I mean that that doesn't that seems odd for two we're currently sitting at 9 996 317 3,683 3,683 views on this video of which we've already got 250 people here you know then this then this channel hits a million views mental thank you to everyone that's watched by the way cuz literally you know literally couldn't have done it without you that's literally the whole point um but yeah so we better give Stu away yeah we'll give we'll give stuff away absolutely no problem um so let's get on to the games let's go to the games game week four lots of interesting fixures as you said the man of the moment that we're looking at on screen is xia Pedro lots of plane tracking as we said um obviously got the home fixture against IP switch which is prime um for anybody that hasn't seen this graphic before this is from Rob tfpl he takes the data from spreadex the BET markets and essentially projects gives a projected number of goals uh for each team as well as a percentage chance of a clean sheet and so you know the normal people end up at the top of this most weeks so you'll you'll find if Liverpool and City have home games generally they'll be sitting at the top and you see here Liverpool with a plum fixture which obviously we know about 2.8 expected goals with a 46% chance of a clean sheet City 2.95 against brenford with a 46% chance of a clean sheet uh Brighton 2.4 with a 42% chance of a clean sheet and then Villa kind of 2.15 with a 40% chance of a clean sheet against Everton all home games it's just huge on those for and that's why World card like it's it's obviously they could always be upsets they could always be upsets that don't do it but but if you're playing the odds you're playing the thing you know having eight or nine players from those teams this weekend on wild card should be good it should be should be real good it's um it's massive and then and then you know when you're looking at individuals palace with a palace with a two expected goals doesn't happen very often um but to have it this week with a 36% chance of a clean those with Henderson Munos e Mata any of those you're playing them and you're very happy playing them this weekend um yeah Palmer away away bourma for 1.95 even if you're playing seeno at 1.5 actually to be fair is it's it's not it's not terrible I can see why a lot of people are looking into their teams and just thinking I've got loads of really strong players you know you've got obviously Man United at Southampton nearly expected two two goals there so you're thinking Bruno's has got to have some involvement surely surely for his first involvement of the season and then even you know Newcastle W wolves 1.85 like in terms of a game week where you've got so many teams like 1.8 or above expected goals screams it screams it um even the Spurs even even North London Derby is going to be you know oh it's goals just goals just goals and goals um 1.5 versus 1.8 here at the moment has Arsenal as a slight favorite which makes sense and it's only really the it's only really the promoted sides that are looking particularly weak at here all the teams play Liverpool and City everon I suppose so I don't know let's just start with the with the middle middle line here which is Liverpool forest and Man City brenford and just say that you know both teams with a 46% chance of a clean cheat according to the data and so you know Defenders are good doubling up on Liverpool defense good City Defender good but do you could you C anyone out of Salo if outside of Salo or harand this week I don't think it's worth it I don't I just don't think it's worth it I mean like there will be people that will Captain like a captain like a Xiao Pedro or Bruno or a Palmer they will yeah there'll be some random ones but I just don't think it's worth it I think so guess I guess the question back is like who would you Captain out of Salah and Holland if you had both I have both and it's oh yeah it's it's it's on Harland yeah not even a Shadow of Doubt for me on this one um partially because I of the goals I expect him to be firmly involved in it but secondly is is the the worry for me on the Liverpool one is the Tuesday game you know is is um there's a potential that they take players off you know for me who owns jotter I'm thinking realistically best case best case situation for jot this week 65 yeah probably yeah don't like his it's it's probably best case isn't it this week for for doter but um yeah Mo plays a lot of minutes so you'd expect him to play a lot of minutes but if they are PR up and they can get to free0 up in any game without that [ __ ] that can happen Diaz and J can score many many goals Trent can score you know is Sly can score they can they've got many many that that can score but you do think for City if they're fre now up harland's probably got the braak in them yeah um not saying that I don't think like the right thing the right thing here is they both both walk away of about 13 15 points is that's what it should be this is a great game for each of them so if you've only got Salah shouldn't be that fearful of it it's a brilliant time to have just Salah if you've only got Harland it's great you just Captain Harland yeah yeah easy decision it if you've got both I haven't seen many people with both that are C in MO that's interesting um I don't know any chat might tell us if if there is anyone in it but um I haven't seen any as far as I'm aware that I've got both the on Captain M this weekend I don't I don't know whether you know we've spoken about the way that Tom Thomas Frank sets up against City making it more difficult for them um with that three at the back could it be again I mean I think we're all just waiting for one of them to blank right so that we can start of sort of start working out what to do but I don't know I think I might I think yeah I think probably if you if you've got Harland and Sally you're probably less covered on the city Side in terms of covering like the outer bits whereas if you know if you're if you've got Salah you've probably got a Trent a robo a jotter a Diaz that covers more of the Liverpool side so yeah having more of that coverage I think probably I would Captain Harland if I had both I think that's probably the way I would lean yeah obviously it is there is some more eggs in basket if you if you if you do Mo with all the other bits around it you know but I do think um yeah just in general is is I it would be in my mind as what is a factor then playing away in Milan on Tuesday night is a factor yeah um and that's probably it but you it's a worth it's not a bad gamble do you know what I mean for those that those that really want to load up that they got triple Liverpool and they Captain Mo and Harem blanks monster it dreaming dreaming like like like those things can happen too um so who are the outer pieces then from the Liverpool that you think are going to benefit the most I mean we obviously we spoke to JN and John was like Diaz is like perfect because it suits Salah it kind of Suits Diaz on the other side as well um yeah I guess we've got to wait and here from slot around the attacking options because um to see if there's any signs that Diaz might be an issue but we could get leaks they're Saturday games aren't they so there's every chance that we could get some form of leak around these ones um around Diaz and uh and J to know they're not playing um if but Trend obvious like it at some point it's going to happen you know you know at some point he has got to attacking mat return um I did think what John mam about Robo was really interesting because I think the quite a few people that would have watched the the the Man United game would have said well he just played left Center back so that's not the same as what Trent was doing but it it it does remind me a bit the position that he's playing at the moment and and John referenced it that he had you know some good goal it um it does remind me a little bit of the vardal type way in the in the bigger games yes he might play left Center back but in the games we on top he might just turn up at left forward yeah he might just turn up at left forward and um and he might just have some good goal threat in in in those games and he's taking huge number of set pieces um so a guy if you'd have thought if You' have thought about vardal being 6.0 but with set pieces at the end of last season we might get that from Rob we might um I think the thing with Trent is you kind of know a little bit more you kind of know what he's going to do every every game he's going to play off off the right with more goal scoring threat than we' probably ever seen him maybe less assist thre than we've ever seen seen him you know people would say but the England game it's interesting the England game in midweek where people would say oh yeah what he got an assist his assist was like the worst thing he did all game what he actually did was was put a a huge number of of of good deliveries in during the game that didn't that didn't pay um but was so sort of outcome based it's he got an assist yeah um that was just a tap and then Kane did the rest um but yeah no I for me if I was wild card in this week I would probably do Trent Robo Mo that be me okay um where you sitting with it because you're on the Wild Card yeah at the moment I've only got two of them right so I've only got two I've only I'm not tripling up on not triple Liverpool no wow no not not at the moment I feel like I want to get a balance between I feel like I want to get a balance between the best three teams in the country to be honest because they've all got because they've all got good fix just coming up in times right and so having transfers to move around pieces where fixtures change feels better feels like a better use of these transfers than than having to move off sacka to Salah which seems likeing Madness when they both bang and you know moving off Robertson to Gabrielle which I might do anyway but it might be the only one I do for example um so yeah there's a couple of things there I'm thinking I mean it's interesting you spoke about you just mentioned about Robo turning up at left forward you know I'm looking at spoiler alert I've got vardal and Robertson in my in my I got two left forwards potentially in games like this in games like this so you know that could be um that could be could could be interesting um what's your feel so I think you know how I'm going to play this but what's your feeling around you know going pretty heavy in on Brighton uh for four and five and then softening slightly for six and seven I I mean I like I like for Bren as a keeper pick he would he would be in for me um and I'd have I just need to have a look at the fixtures but I've I've seen some people say for bran and Henderson might be quite a good long-term play If you're looking like 20 odd weeks um I would do the double four point five um so for Bren and either uh yeah probably might might still stick with henerson as as the other option for it um Johnston is probably the other one for me for W's better fixtures but haven't fully played it through but for Bren I would go I and I like him more than I like Dunc as the as the as the defensive pick you'd obviously go J Pedro that's not even yeah a question for me um and then I think it depends a little bit more on the number of transfers you've got you've got free transfers yeah bit much more a much more interested in looking at M as as a picture um for me with one if I was going 5.5 or less on the five than Rogers or seeno and I preference for me would be SEO if I could have got it um I think there's something there's something interesting to talk about um talk about Villa and there's a Super Chat which I'll mention in just a second Matt um yeah there's interesting there's interesting conversations to have around Villa right now should we just go there just just just one I'm going to indulge Mr Rockstar in the chat because he's been abusing me all week on this one which is that I've been saying that Trent's been very lucky to get free clean sheets and and what I would say is if you're looking at this right now on the screen the Liverpool have a the best potential clean sheet odds this week at 46% less than a 50% chance doing it and they've had less than a 50 each time so the idea that they got three heads in a row is lucky like there's no for any team that if they got four you know if if they B this year that's more than that's that's more than the better odds of of flipping a coin and getting four heads in a row getting four cleans in a row is pretty lucky yeah yeah um is is what's unlucky is the attacking returns so as I said what what I said the the other week was was that people are saying oh my God should be 12 15 points and so forth could also have had twos cir he had two very good chances last in the last game and didn't take them you know and and there is potential that you don't see as many points of it there's definitely potential when you've got the best clean sheet odds and you're a really good attacker that he could score 20 points this weekend yeah that's that's that's what you face into I I'm as it stands got no Trent um and it's going to require hits for me to get Trent do I think about that very very regularly probably [Laughter] hourly probably hourly like when I'm looking at this this week as a person that's not on wild card and actually doesn't have the greatest team in the world this week I'm looking at this and going I've got no a that really bothers me I've got no J Pedro it really bothers me I've got no it really bothers me I've got no R Lewis it really bothers me I've got no Palmer it really bothers me I think it's going to be the season at some point where everyone's going to face into that at some point I mean facing into that right now I mean you spoke about you spoke about salah's minutes right like these minutes are G this this is a 46% chance I'm you know we just we just roughly just say that this is based on them playing the whole game but you getting you you reference Milan right they've got an extremely extremely capable Conor Bradley uh just sitting there so well we might find that out though might we might find out what he might not even start are we even thinking that um we'll find out if he's not mate but but I think it I think it increases his chance of clean sheet again if he's very if he's likely to come off after 60 65 when he came off last game what was his Baseline oh it was five five worst Baseline he's ever had it was nobody's nobody's buying Trent for two or six so we can kill ourselves on that but but what you do lose yes you'll get increased chances of of cleans but you do lose 20% of the attacking returns if you're coming off at 65% you know um oh Flapjack and Rockstar sh just just prom you wild wild card oh is he yeah yeah sliding on him lovely uh Villa Villa's interesting because kza gets injured although he's okay I think he's okay well you get you gotta wait on that news you got wait on that news because carsley said yeah I think he's okay I mean I haven't spoke to him so we got oh I think okay so there is that um what Watkins obviously goes home from International Duty hasn't been seen in training yet so there's that Morgan Rogers plays scores twice including a penalty so there's that good penalty like yeah it's a good pen good pen wa he did the call Palmer celebration so he's on pens but any pen that goes into good pen funny thing is though right I know it's I know it is ridiculous but play back the bit where Palmer and Sterling were fighting against in the Luton game that was about the same was it game week four it was game week four I think last season where Palmer rips the ball off of Sterling and takes the penalty and at the time we didn't know he takes penalties and he did and suddenly we had A5 million pound penalty taker that's the only thing if you if you're like spreading around and you don't go Rogers on W card and then he does take a penalty yeah that's the real worry CU I think you had did you have pal wild card when we wild carded early last season I didn't and then I didn't get him for about eight to about eight or nine yeah yeah yeah yeah I didn't I had him like five and a half by the time sudden he lit like if he takes a penalty oh it' be Carnage it's going to create absolute Carnage he'll be he'll be 54 five five well he'll go up point two in a week he'll be in for the rest he'll be in till game week 38 yeah that's he be he just be in be be for the rest of just because the fixes are so good now I mean it may like literally injury will be the only thing that takes him out but we had no idea that Palmer was was the big dog that he was and until until he was yeah so when he did that c I like expected celebration you never know you never know so but yeah fill filla you got to you got you got there just not that many assets to go for is there like obviously conza is there Emmy is there um Watkins is there PES is there that is about not really going to the rest yeah there is a question so Matt chat out thanks for the Super Chat he says will Duran replace Watkins as Villa's First Choice number nine I don't think so I don't think so he'll be impact Plus maybe Champions League May well maybe like coming in in Champions League games sometimes I mean I think we'd more likely see him when if slash when Villa go out the Champions League maybe they drop into Europa is that does that is that still a thing I don't even know I don't even know if they can drop into Europa but is he is he going to be first choice no I don't think so you don't come off a season like like you did last year and then just be dropped after three games cuz you're a bit tired from the Euros we have some um we have some good analytics boys that that that uh watch our pod and do our stuff um uh interesting for me this week is potential hits so when do I hit versus when do I Wild Card like I'm looking at some of these fixtures and surely everyone always says you know if you're going to if you're going to hit do it in a double game week but that's that's kind of like the overall where it's okay I do wonder about this we I'm still looking at it so I've got Gabrielle you know should I be hitting Gabrielle to Robo should I hit should I bench gab Gabrielle leave him there and hit Hall to Lewis start Lewis rather than Gabrielle like solves a problem gets Lewis in maybe he stays in forever um if jotter doesn't play I could even minus eight J to e and do Gabrielle to Trent like I'm pretty sure if the rules hadn't changed to uh you can carry five transfers over and there's people sitting on three transfers and all that stuff it wouldn't seem like the worst thing in the world but because there are people sitting with free transfers and rolling them fre wild card seems like the worst thing in the world but I am I do keep looking at these and thinking should I be playing Gabrielle when I could just hit in yeah Lewis for example yeah I guess at the end of the season it's going to be like that's a I guess that's sort of a meta question is whether we think at the end of the season the points titles are going to be higher than we'd expect not versus all the seasons with the double game weeks but maybe higher than we'd expected because we are having um you know these extra transfers to to play with essentially uh maybe maybe maybe maybe that is the case and that that probably then you know makes hits feel worse in in that sense we said we said this we said this pregame one right we said this pregame week one like if you got if you got anywhere near having to take hits early on in the season you were going to look it was going to look yeah yeah yeah it's embarrassing really bad it looks it looks like just utter failure but I'm like well I'm I'm also you look at me go in this week with porro and I've going with porro and Gabrielle yeah 17 22% how many points do you think I will lose as an estimate to those with Lewis and Trent yeah I mean yeah I mean you might get four let's say let's let's say four and you get let's say an assist from porro because we want Spurs to score you get seven then you probably get Lewis probably gets a clean so that's six maybe get a an assist that's nine Trent gets 12 points or 18 points yeah I mean you just make it up immediately I mean you might not because they're both really good players score ah header and could score you've also got then you've also then got Lewis and you got Trent for next week as well well you wouldn't play Lewis next week you wouldn't play Lewis next week we got Trent but you wouldn't play gabri probably wouldn't play Lewis the next two weeks is the problem you probably wouldn't play leis the next two weeks and you certainly you know and you want Gabrielle back six but then like a wild card you what I mean so it's so realistically it's like like do you take that risk this week if you think you might wild card in a couple of weeks it's it's a difficult one it's a really difficult one but I think there is definitely some sentiment in me that says well normally I I would definitely be taking a hit this week um but it feels feels grubby yeah the only reason why I might take a hit rather than necessarily wild card is that this week I've got moan Harland and on wild card like you're facing into I'm not sure what's the right decision I'm not sure if having both or if having one is the right play so you know do I think if you get to six I think if you get to six and your wild carding I think you just go Harland right that's that's the that's the play you don't you don't get seller yeah yeah yeah which maybe makes which maybe makes the route for wild card to start with Salah and then work your way out back to harand maybe yeah I think I was trying to do that anyway to be honest but um right are we looking at any more here nah nah um just to just to cover uh you know those those big hitting players so the data the the odds The Bookies odds are expecting 1.13 goals from Harland 68% chance of at least one goal which is it it could be really swingy this week if you look at it obviously har and V are the top two yeah on this list you've got J Pedro at .61 and you've got munis 0.45 everyone's got one of the other like I've got munes loads of people most people got J Pedro J ped's obviously better but it's not like it's terrible yeah you've got then you go Watkins and isack exactly the same 0.59 each and Mata sitting there a lot of people have got one of those three not many people have got two of those three yeah J and Diaz like it's just there J and and J and E like I went J over e in game week one because of the speculation around e I'm sitting and being like Oh my God I'm scared of e realistically a people should be scared of J you know is is is there you phone arama all these ones um it could swing it really could swing in in in or they could just all score and then everyone just gets lots of points and everyone's everyone gets points that's not how this game works it's not how this game works I'm just let me I just wanted to remind myself how the um what the the timings of the games are like how how will that everyone gets points but with I mean everyone's going to have points by the end of Saturday oh they're playing at the same time Liverpool City play at 3:00 both of them oh this is so much worse for me right so cuz you've got Hall and esack on Sunday and Spurs and Arsenal on Sunday and I've got I've got I've got Gordon esack porro and Gabrielle all playing Sunday like my red arrow Saturday night is just going to be legendary and then you're going to expect and then at 2 o'cl you you're a not going to care but B not going to get anything no so it's just gonna it's just going to be all on on new car at 4:0 come join us Sunday night I'll be the most miserable man on Earth no but no well you're gonna have like last game of the gameweek Vibes that's what you're gonna have I'm just I just need Totten to win true that's all we care about on on on Tottenham which is on wild card if an says sank fit have you considered him yeah yes there's a there's a lot around there's a lot around those four Strikers right isach Watkins havs salanki those four the Spurs Arsenal game makes salanki and um havs a bit awkward and Watkins and the problem is obviously Harland as well in the next four weeks so it's you do need to you do need to sacrifice something in in the Midfield to make that happen now that can that I mean we can talk about it when we get to my team but that can be done there are ways and means to get there but you have to go a couple of five fives but I mean maybe just maybe it's not Watkins maybe it's maybe it's you know salanki and and Rogers instead of say Bruno and Watkins which is a lot cheaper but it frees up a lot of money but it gets you it gets you ahead on a transfer and then whatever the third Striker is you could move that around to you know make things better with Salah at stuff like that so you can't you can get around it it's just um because salanki fixtures are good I good you'd never bench salanki I think if you've got salanki hav sacka son any of those guys I think you just play them in this fixture because they're I yes it's like 1.8 versus 1.5 but you know we know that we know that generally there are goals in in um in North London Derbies they just are it's like two tws and two ones and all this sort of stuff that very regularly happens um I've got to call out two things in the chat one is Squidward who said that he wanted to take a hit for Rico Lewis but acent brought Rico Henry I just hope I hope that's true I hope it's true I mean it's hilarious it's hilarious and the the funny thing is you just bench him for two weeks and then you play him and uh James Morgan says best pot ever good lads love it love it let's look at fixtures let's look at fixtures fixtures fixtures fixtures sorry I'm clicking around um oh before just before we look at fixtures I just wanted to just sort of highlight something on the um on the spreadex market just to show what can actually change during the week in terms of what data goes into this so Rob T sent us um this for Tottenham versus Arsenal so obviously Arsenal the red lines Tottenham are the blue line and as time has progressed between you know the start of the international break where it was at like 1.8 for Arsenal and then 1.3 for um for Tottenham in fact that's actually before the international break started and it's after the Spurs game so what happens there is over the early part of the international break Arsenal get better like the book like the odds get better for Arsenal and then we see a small Rise um and then there's a very slight rise for Tottenham but the you know the thought is that you know Tottenham defensively but it's real close players get injured things change and it's a lot closer now 1.7 1.55 I think it was 1.8 on the graphic before it' be very interesting to see see what happens if tomorrow we get confirmation that sank is okay and odard is not you know is is because the thing is on odard right like immediately gets report he'll miss three weeks because the doctor said oh that sort of thing looks like it'll be about three weeks yeah before he's actually gone to see in arsenal we don't know we don't know um I love the Twitter physios as well love the Twitter phos um but it's ominously quiet from Tottenham which we keep seeing this happen during International breaks is we are very we are continuously last season we saw it this season we're starting to see it is whenever there's a break you get nothing from social media from Tottenham so we don't know if Mickey Van's okay we don't know if sank is okay yeah if they're both okay and odard not I'd be interested to see see this but again an an generally speaks like he'll be ask those questions directly and he'll generally just say yeah Mickey's okay uh Dominic's available he's Dominic's available for selection he'll say stuff is problem is with those kind of knocks especially in a big game you know you know what Gabriel and and S going do they got to kick him straight in if he is fit true um um yeah it's it's a big risk going there in in five but if we don't get any news on Watkins and it seems like yes he's potentially okay there's always an out there because if yeah if we go to the fixtures and have a look come gameweek five onwards for Tottenham it's an okay run brenford man united Brighton West Ham Palace fellows which it's okay if he's playing all the minutes hey he might even be 7.4 by the time you get to him maybe um but yeah we've also got very like we've also probably got the weakest well we definitely do have the weakest run of Internet uh European as well in this in this spot yeah um I think I would be tempted I think I probably if Watkins looks a bit dodgy I think I would probably just stick with isack walls and Fulham that is the thing like the no the no Europe thing is is something that you know what this is this is this is the point in six weeks time we have that moment where we say next season we have to remember the team the good teams that don't have Europe the teams that generally do better in this period and Newcastle is that team like it's literally that team look everybody else has got Europe yeah Newcastle is that team so not having Newcastle coverage in this period could hurt and may maybe it won't hurt hurt instead of like in terms of rank but you what I mean is you will you can be missing out on points yeah I think more than anything yeah I mean I've got hope I'm sitting here with isack and Gordon mate and and it's interesting it as an esack and Gordon I'm not trying to I'm not actually feeling that narrative type things I'm like oh my God I don't want them um but there is a hope there is a hope you know it's certainly they're not certainly not the sort of team to or players to hit out um there there is a comment here that Brighton Brighton are the best team not in Europe yet well then that's arguable as well that's fair they are for the next couple of weeks yes but fix just turn pretty quickly but you don't mind it because they're so cheap they are very cheap very cheap they're so cheap um yeah I mean we are into it now the danger the danger always of the wild card is before you see what happens I don't maybe that's a bit overplayed I think like I think it is a little overplayed like teams also at start season need to have a good start you've got to you know um is it's points on the board is really really important Tottenham and Chelsea for example with their Europa ones they can't afford it they both we've both got like what we got four points or whatever Four Points one one draw weeks um we got to get going yeah Chelsea got to get going man united got to get going you know Newcastle um have actually had a good start but they've got to make hey you know is um nobody can afford to let up and if we've got a freeway title race they can't afford to let up either no there was something that I heard on the athletic uh last week actually um in prep actually for speaking to John was that generally speaking the league table is kind of in place by gameweek 10 like there's very little differentiation between game we if like game week 10 is the week where it has the least differentiation between the end of season result versus like the weeks previous to it so it's generally by gameweek 10 the league is in its General spot there were a few exceptions um Tottenham and Villa Bas to Tottenham Villa and Chelsea were the three big exceptions last year but everything else kind of fell where they were so yeah if you're not on the board by game week 10 I mean like that's that's the that's the risk for all of these teams and I was saying to a guy today like um playing golf and I was just saying to him I said it's it's a year where you ask fans where you think you're going to finish and any one of outside the top three there any one of villa Tottenham Chelsea Newcastle man united Brighton you can even add West Ham fans sometimes in this conversation but the everyone is thinking Fifth and up right everyone is thinking Fifth and up some like the four the battle for fourth is going to be really really challenging yeah vill have opened the door there hav't they they've shown you know you can get on a run and just keep going um and hold it um it's it's people are going to want points means they got to play their players yeah yeah exactly um yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't be hugely worried about it it might make some it might there might be some nuances around captaincy there might be some bits where we look at it and think okay you know but some of things also you got to cross the bridge when you come to it like you can easily say oh well PSG games in between the leester and Southampton gam so I'm not going to bother with all the all the Arsenal players the great thing about the Wild Card this week you can make that decision when you get there as opposed to those that are wild carding like me you know probably game week six game week seven I'm going to be like okay what if I play it all and then they don't play um it's you know we'll we'll we'll uh we'll work it out when we get there but I do think everyone needs needs the points on the board yeah he'll be all right yeah interesting that they got four four home games in a row Arsenal so it's not like they really actually have to travel which is kind of nice for them I guess that is nice is that is nice and the and and the carabel one who cares yeah who cares yeah yeah because they won't be playing anyone um right so we're going to move on to our teams now we're 50 minutes in I saw I saw that yeah I saw that go on you you go for it uh from uh Caris Sima uh jotter to e I'm on Triple Liverpool with Salah and Trent I just think J's if you find news that J is going to start how do you take him out like he he's J if you know he's starting he's a very difficult man to take out with a free chance the issue is is e is bench in a week time maybe in three weeks time definitely against Liverpool but you probably don't want to I think because you can always keep those extra transfers now you're not using them all I'd rather have the transfer this week yeah okay because it's it's comparable picture wise this week if they're both starting next week you you want Jas still um if I was wild card in and you said J or E I'd have e yeah okay because you're not using a transfer yes agreed yeah agreed yeah it's almost a shame it's almost a shame he's like the only real example we can we can use I'd love to say would you do like J to CU because what I wanted to see was what would you do if the fixtures were better but I guess we're not living in that world because the only players we can really look at that with are Rogers mow I switch Everton so it's like well who cares about that so let's uh let's move on to teams if you haven't done so already if you want to make sure you like the video If you do enjoy what we're doing yeah um haven't had a quick check how many likes we got on the video just for now oh just over a 100 so that's good just over 100 400 of you in there though so say 25% of the people watching us that is poor uh you are not on wild card so probably spend more time on mine um I'm the man not even got Pete's FPL team up here we just got my good old screenshot of my phone move made no transfers in this is me grumpy me going to lose um you have to read it out because for people who are listening on podcast mate yeah so I've made my transfer in the week which was sack a Salah I've got about half a million .4 in the bank um but I would need to hit because I spent it taking sanky out and taking inko out and now now doing the salar in um so I got Henderson and goal fingers crossed never know well you've got it I mean that's that's an obvious one right you got like you just play Henderson oh obviously you will play Henderson but even unlike if you're wild card in and if you have Henderson you play play yeah yeah um so porro Robinson and Gabrielle starting don't have much choice because I haven't really got a bench got Hall and Johnson and Z Gar so a fun 11 pick themselves um Gordon Rogers jotter Salah and then Moonis isack harand so I'm all done far as it goes um if I was looking at any moves um then yeah it wouldn't take a huge amount for me a wild card you said this 10 days ago we said we're just waiting for waiting for tomorrow to see what tomorrow says yeah I think it'll but I no I think it'll I think I'll be saying this every Thursday night okay I think I'll be saying it you know every day um because while you've got like Po Gabrielle in place rather than say your Trent and Lewis which it's so much more fun after a while it kind of comes back to those players you what I mean and and you know maybe Newcastle sort themselves out and you're like oh they're not in Europe maybe just hold them for a little bit longer because Watkins doesn't look you know right and all those things so I am open that I'm don't necessarily wild card in six I might just run this into the ground um and that might be if I can't ever get transfers in the bank maybe that is the play you know is the is the is that you leave it for a little while because you know I could easily for example do no transfer in five and in six I could do Salah to sacka moon is to um HS and I've got perfect triple Arsenal I've already got Harland in place yeah and then I'm like well maybe I'll leave it a few more weeks so I'm incredibly fragile in myos I hate my team I don't expect greed arrows um you just try to stick around I'm just trying to stick around really stick around stick around build some build some transfers build something build some stock but the worry is is is that if you don't have your gameweek one team absolutely it doesn't fully come off everything you've done with this new system of rolling five transfers and and you know rolling them through wild cards might never catch up maybe yeah no it's going to be interesting to see yeah especially mean you might be you might be just fighting a battle forever like we don't know we don't well this is it CU we're going to be people are going to be having people are going to be starting their like their thoughts around bench boosters and all this sort of stuff around and there's going to be people that are firefighting with no transfers versus people starting with like five transfers and going ah I can I can plot this but if I'm hanging in then I might just go what you know what maybe I should just keep hanging in for a bit more because maybe a different Avenue opens up um you know maybe there is 12 wild card or something 18 19 Wild Card something that just goes oh [ __ ] mystery ship here we go yeah I mean I feel absolutely dreadful for months trying to work through what it is but but hey maybe come Christmas it'll all look pretty again yeah let's get you mate you're the fun yeah and before we do my team uh another Super Chat Nial has said rate my team W card draft uh so Ryan fabianski Trent pal Tores uh Lewis mrai Greaves Salah Palmer e Boomer matoma isack HZ ja game week six have free transfers to get sacka to sacka and Harland in I mean that looks outstanding it's not going to not look outstanding this is true I mean it's it's very nice very nice to give us some money but uh but but we're gonna say it's good because it's bloody good Salah p booma is have having yeah just having fun with Mata that's who you Bening this week buo grieve bumo and then hav I guess yeah you play mrai against Southampton you play Palmer yeah you play a you play yeah that's be I don't think you can play masra because you've been playing Trent po Lewis Trent pow Le maybe you maybe you play Four man well if we don't know it's goingon to be good that's good um col says I'm sorry Baker I seven of your starting lineup C what are you doing to me right here we go so this is this is where I'm get it out get it out get it out it's not that kind of it's not that kind of pod mate um yeah you asked me earlier you asked me like how many drafts do you have and I was like well like one two something like that because did I say this pre- pod I'm pretty sure said this pre-ot you said this pre-ot mate cuz I've not seen it so so I think people they might think we've been mucking about with this for the last two weeks no no no I'm seeing this now I haven't seen it the first time at all for the first time because I'd rather have like one maybe two drafts rather than having 20 because I am the kind of person that would have one or two and if the one or two goes wrong then okay it's a bit annoying but that's kind of where I was whereas if I had 20 and one of them absolutely smashed it or two of them absolutely smashed it and I didn't pick that one I'd be fum I just like well I had it I literally had the right one there um obviously outcome biased and whatever but you know I would be I would be raging I would be raging um so as of now I have a goalkeeper pairing of Martinez and Johnston Villa fixtures are really good all the way up until game week um game 10 when they go away to Spurs and when they go away to Spurs wolves have Palace at home and then they have Southampton at home when Villa have Liverpool and then in the week that Villa have Chelsea away the wolves have got Bournemouth at home so like there's there's actually a really really good rotation between those two I understand Keepers it's not a it's not a rotation as such though it's Martinez is my main keeper Johnson is the 4 four right Johnson is the 44 and when Villa have three tough away away fixtures I just change it up okay it's not it's not rotating it's not rotating um uh back three of Robertson Lewis and vardal at the moment yes and I've got porro and leaf Davis on the bench there's a lot of opportunity to play Leaf Davis um from now up until 15 16 1 like there's just you can play them all the way up until 18 if you really want so there he can come in and he will come in next week is is kind of the plan with Southampton and porro fix is improve and it's pedroo so that's where I'm at with that Salah Captain because there's no Harland here uh Yan kuminta E saaka Bruno I can't I can't believe I really can't believe I've got three wild through like a wild card draft and going I'm not dropping Bruno but that Southampton game is is is too much there is plans to like move Bruno out um because I just think you need boomo in six basically I just think you need boomo in six so you know there's a there's a very easy route to to bumo there and then Xiao Pedro and I've got Watkins so I can't see that Watkins is just going to continue to not score goals because the fixtures are too good for that to happen so there is a there is obviously you know a requirement that Emory turns around and says oie's fine he's good he's ready to go um he's really been helpful having these two weeks off Etc it's really helped him rest and recuperate we're confident da d d da 65 minutes grabs a couple of goals gets subs for John Duran don't care perfect that's fine um that said you know there is uh you know a potential opportunity to go down to a salanki and then that means I can potentially do more with Bruno money later on um I've got a dead spot in my Striker which again I don't mind um I I don't mind at all because I'm going to want to get to Harland so I just want to I'm quite happy to run with Harland in a four five one because as I said Pedro parro and Davis I'll have vardal I'll probably have Gabrielle in um in six so you know I cover the Arsenal there uh with that I think it's pretty balanced I kind of like it thing is the extra by running five Defenders effectively what we're saying is is you know I've seen teams say with wher for example as the third Striker yeah um that's an extra one and a half million on Stuart it is but Davies Leaf Davis is only an extra. five so it's a million there's a million quid there it's a lot of money to have somebody um so where we always be like is mate for Tacker I think if you've got five Defenders and effectively you've always got cover for Lewis now cuz you got five ERS yeah is is there's there's a there's a lot there for it would you just from my references perro and Davis would you play them both over vardal and Lewis next week yes yeah doesn't say because you don't do hedging so soaka plays right sasaka plays in that fixture has to play yeah don't don't hedge because there's no there's planning on no transfer in five you're going to six with four transfers six with four transfers it's so strong when I'm going to need need so I I am going to want bumo I'm probably going to want to move off of Min in six as well and I'm going to want Gabrielle so there's potentially there's potential like three book transfers in here does it does feel a bit icky like that but so the two looking at it that people would say look at this straight away and go it's it's Tren and at stroke no F Liverpool yeah um and it's and it's I just don't understand how Harland gets in get I don't understand where the money comes from for Harland like I just don't understand where where it comes from like what what do you do like I mean this so this this this does have a million and a half in the bank this does have a million and a half in the bank just for wow wow wow a million and a half in the bank I'm pretty sure it does I i' I've got it built in FPL team so I'm just trying to work out whether I'm pretty sure I changed all the all the pricing on it um I'm pretty sure this has a million and a half in the bank give me a second let's just check just check my Lewis change transfer price Lewis in price 4.6 yeah yeah yeah this is million and a half in the bank I'm not I I don't fully fathom I'll be honest with you I don't fully fathom keeping a million and a half and not having trans and having free transfers because you got to move a player to move a player do you know what I mean like it's not th those type of stuff so so I think most people watching will say just do vard Trent yeah but then that just creates a transfer doesn't create a transfer does it yeah but I want I want vardal in seven so there's there it creates a transfer I have to make that trans so if I if I I do that have to make the transfer though do you I don't have to to make the transfer because Trent could Trent could just be the best defender in the game I think most people would expect it if people said like let's take a bet on who's who's going to score the most points in the game just have Trent would you yeah but if you're going to say like who's going to score the most points in is Trent going to score more Palace Chelsea Arsenal Brighton or is it going to be viio Fulham wolf Southampton Bournemouth but next week you're playing Leaf Davis over Trent at home to Southampton to bouth yeah no I wouldn't rather have him just play just get train lose you can't lose it's an extra transfer it's not an extra transfer it's not an extra transfer because you don't know that you would move Trent out you don't know what you're going to do in game week seven this is game we four we're true you know is is is in game week five and six like against a't Nori against a't Nori and six as opposed to go into Newcastle I've got Salah for that I've got Salah you don't think you don't think over the next free that Trent scores Four Points more than viio so even if you do use a TR you'll have four of them yeah maybe V Trent I won't bother you about any of the others but V Trend just seems big fair enough big fair enough um for the rest of it solid is it like you can't I just worry I do I do just worry about Le more than anything I do just worry about Lewis say the information from Lewis let's say let's say for whatever reason you know pep starts to manage minutes and Walker comes in and something happens Defenders mate you got five starting Defenders so it comes four yeah okay no that's fair porro and leis even on the hardest fixtures par and Davis could score yeah they could assist they could bonus they could score any game they have rooster points they very rarely walk away with two pointers okay I we take it into consideration on the trend thing yeah and um I can still do all the moves I want to do even if I do that so thinking yeah I can I can still do it all I can still do it all if I want to do that just but there is there is like a if I even if I go like even if I get to gameweek Seven there's a hit involved now based on what I've transfers you can do whatever you want no no but I'm saying there's a there's a hit involved in game we seven if that's if I if I want if you have to make those seven transfers wherever it is by then minut but stuff will change we will see we will see that's that's if you're trying to run another wild card out in six we don't know you will yeah I I'm going to be fighting against people at that point we know they're going to be fighting against wild carders at that point they're going to be moving to Players let's you know once let's say vardal scores against Arsenal like he's just going to be the most owned defender in the game on wild card he just will be but you might go Robo to him and keep Trent do you know what I mean you've got that option no but Robo will already become Gabrielle so it's like you don't know these yet you don't know these yet they're weeks away you don't but you're not you're you're not cutting yourself out from them no I you get Tren if you get Trent you're not cutting yourself course because you because you're at the price as you're at the price as well that means you can get anywhere so yes you're right you're not you know we' we've if someone said to me oh well I've got Trad for the next two I've wild carded I've got this amazing things I'm not the only person I'm taking on really is Harland and in two weeks time I'll have four transfers you're in a pretty good position rock stars calling me out he say Adam doesn't deserve Trent [ __ ] off like I triple Captain Trent I believe in Trent more than most people he's just winding both of us up with Trent all night that's all he's doing that's all he's doing ah right I think we're there mate I think we're there um so yeah that's and if grad if you're watching that's my that's my team okay just so I'm not late for skw every he's like I said to him I said how the hell can I be late when I publicly put my team on YouTube like how is it even possible um yeah gotta do it got to do it um yeah I don't think there's anything else to to add we're pretty much there thanks to everyone that's come and joined us for the chat hope you've had a nice relaxing International break we are back in it now game kicks off at 12:30 Southampton versus man United is it straight off the bat straight off the bat Bruno hatrick we'll be there I mean hopefully hopefully like I say he he either gets a hatrick this he either double digits always 8.1 come Monday no there is zero in between zero zero between like 500,000 transfers out to bumo um next week one of J orz will score goals this weekend yeah if Bruno don't and they've got bourou next week at home there is that there is that um yeah thanks to the four almost 400 of you guys that have been here thanks to those that have dropped super chats

want to beat you right we'll leave it there mate uh thanks again everyone and uh see you later [Music]",12730,n right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam and as always im joined by baker hello how you doing mate youre right footballs back football is back international break is over and were buzzing its an interesting weekend for us as well like we just have to go straight into the north london derby like just flying into it try not to think try not to think about that it do does feel i think itll hit home tomorrow when you got presses and stuff happening thats god its north spurs have released the danny rose goal already as nostalgia like its already started its there were starting to see a bit chat in our spurs chats and stuff is we were just working through earlier that in the last four games weve managed to give away three own goals a penalty and a red card which is so bad like can you remember like 2018 when we were when remember 2018 when we used to go into these games being relatively confident days are gone anyway hows your international break been mate its been pretty stressful works been busy so i havent had time much time to focus i dont watch international football anyway i have no interest in in watching england in nations league stuff very interested in ogard getting injured for norway but thats thats about it i keep an eye on it through soare mainly just having players in there hyberg smashes it every international break like scores every time for denmark he must be like top goal scorer for them like in the history even like he must be close to like low drop and that stuff nows hes at that level but i dont i dont dont watch them so know no so i watch him on the ipad i never put on the telly just have a little bit on it but its it feels quite it feels like a long break feels like the longest break and now b its a big week this its a huge week youre on wild card yes loads on wild card i think they said there was like 700000 activated like that i saw maybe earli on in the week but might be more than that by now loads and loads and loads huge bet p have a drink all right ive got here some never say die bourbon from the good people this is a one of the only bourbons thats done in kentucky and then brewed and then matured in england and theyve kindly sent me some bottles i knew i drun whiskey long enough on this that somebody would would join in and we will do some giveaways at some point for this but cheers never say die whiskey shout out to never say die whiskey this is this my first drink in september ive i because i only people must see the whiskey and think i just drink all the time but i only drink whiskey when i when i pod thats it but all right get the brand you is this is this the first sip or is this ive had it before but its my first first at home and it is delightful ive been ive been on the golf course today ive had a few beers and stuff already so im let go im drinking tea mate im on the tea now cuz i was i was exhausted i was exhausted but i had my best round of golf all year so well drink to that never said whiskey wait i want some gure like that amazing that is amazing right back to back footballall wild card talk me through wild card so you press the button just talk through like hows it been couple of weeks there been ive been trying to stay away from looking at price changes there been lots of price changes theres been all the farming and been absolutely like no theres theres absolutely none of that like i when i said to when i said with the chat with andy so if you havent listened to the chat that we had with andy on wild card go listen to that but i said that sunday monday was just like hectic because everyone was pushing buttons everyone was making transfers and then everyone just went its an international break lets just calm down a bit and like nobodys moved at all like theres been no other movement so i dont know whether things are going to start to ramp up now that weve got 48 hours until the deadline type vibes so maybe we look at tonight and see if theres anything thats going to move but i think im im past that we did have a little fun on the on the im got 101m team value a little bit earlier on in the week and then you just take all your players out and you end up with only 100m in the bank to spend but ben martin in the chat says throw the score out im assuming him 8 golf today what was the score today ah shot 77 so 77 playing off six net 71 one under had a couple of finish with a birdie as well so its always nice and what was worse is theyd just done full airation on the greens fully ced full of sand it was like playing on it like putting on a beach i said about this you dont mind it when it lands on it mate and its stopping the balls and youre pitch into it people dont mind it when it straightens your ball up but every time a parts missed on an air it green youre like its not my fault mate 45 degrees right on a three foot part just its just anyway golf chat people get annoyed when with the golf chat but lets lets go so so on so on w i have a do i have a small am ounce of regret maybe im just not comfortable with all the teams that ive been looking at and because i feel like im earmarking myself away from harland because i think thats the right thing to do i feel like its the right thing to do particularly over the next three weeks but getting him back in seven eight and the thought of not having him for southampton is weighing on my mind and if i didnt hit the wild card i wouldnt have that concern like the brenford game is a good game for him weve heard the news of his his friend passing so we dont know whether hes going to have any compassionate leave we such gohs that they you can see out there people are straight away honestly the stuff the stuff people will be like well hes definitely miss a game too well 15 9y old mentor is an uncle to me people are already imagining the celebration its were awful people so we dont know whether hes going to be playing or not lets just lets just put it like that it doesnt hes been training today for the game so we should assume that hes going to play so where was i so so thats so no harland is the current where i am i think its no harland but i dont want to go away from i dont want to away from covering city as well because citys next victory is very good and then you can you can rotate around players to make like four five and six work five and six work and then you get you just fly back in for seven but again weve still got so much to see from when the champions league starts theres all that all that risk in front of us which is a little bit nervewracking and i feel like and so so even more so i feel like not having the wild card now to react to that information coming up in a couple of weeks feels a bit but you have got free transfers i have got three transfers so i can react and i can maneuver but it feels like i can be less forthcoming on like planning for it so i have to be more reactive with my transfers which is okay thats fine thats what thats what people who are wild carding maybe in six have been doing weeks one to three right so maybe were all in the same place and were all going to end up having a bit of crap dealing with stuff and thats just what it is is just i would say look im very envious in terms of being in that position is being on world card now is fantastic being on world card with transfers on hand is fantastic i think if i had transfers in hand i think i probably would have wild carded this week and so i still think its i think its a good week when we look at well look at rob ts things but what another reason why its you want the first week to be a good week for it and theres some good fixtures villa and brighton theres a lot on them liverpool is liverpool magnificent but they could be magnus forever but palace got a good week if you havent already got yourself involved in those ones theres loads brighton so bright massive being on the old xiao pedro plane watch love that thats the other one everyones got track planes its its a good week for it im dreading this weekend for it as somebody that is in a precarious position i would say im in where ive got where ive got no transfers not had any transfers at all at any point in the bank and if even if i played wild card id then be like bo what i what angle do i go and i could still end up playing wild card by the time the deadline comes if there was news for example like a harand wasnt playing even ive got to look at players like ive got players like jotter and what if he doesnt play if they decide dars going to going to play the game thats a difficult one so honestly its a strong position wherever you go fair enough we can talk more about that later lets have a look at the games before we do that hello to everyone in the youtube chat and there is a product placement central well we get free whiskey were going to tell them tell people about the free whiskey right thats not anyone wants to send us free stuff we will mention it absolutely that is that is a guarantee and so if you do like the work that we do make sure you drop a like on the video if you like this video and if you want to see more from us make sure you subscribe and the reason i say that is for a number of things so i also said were

genuinely this is nuts like honestly one million views one million views on youtube that doesnt that seems odd for two were currently sitting at 9 996 317 3683 3683 views on this video of which weve already got 250 people here then this then this channel hits a million views mental thank you to everyone thats watched by the way cuz couldnt have done it without you thats the whole point but so we better give stu away well give well give stuff away absolutely no problem so lets get on to the games lets go to the games game week four lots of interesting fixures as you said the man of the moment that were looking at on screen is xia pedro lots of plane tracking as we said got the home fixture against ip switch which is prime for anybody that hasnt seen this graphic before this is from rob tfpl he takes the data from spreadex the bet markets and essentially projects gives a projected number of goals for each team as well as a percentage chance of a clean sheet and so the normal people end up at the top of this most weeks so youll youll find if liverpool and city have home games generally theyll be sitting at the top and you see here liverpool with a plum fixture which we know about 28 expected goals with a 46 chance of a clean sheet city 295 against brenford with a 46 chance of a clean sheet brighton 24 with a 42 chance of a clean sheet and then villa 215 with a 40 chance of a clean sheet against everton all home games its just huge on those for and thats why world card like its its they could always be upsets they could always be upsets that dont do it but if youre playing the odds youre playing the thing having eight or nine players from those teams this weekend on wild card should be good it should be should be real good its its massive and then and then when youre looking at individuals palace with a palace with a two expected goals doesnt happen very often but to have it this week with a 36 chance of a clean those with henderson munos e mata any of those youre playing them and youre very happy playing them this weekend palmer away bourma for 195 even if youre playing seeno at 15 to be fair is its its not its not terrible i can see why a lot of people are looking into their teams and just thinking ive got loads of strong players youve got man united at southampton nearly expected two goals there so youre thinking brunos has got to have some involvement surely for his first involvement of the season and then even newcastle w wolves 185 like in terms of a game week where youve got so many teams like 18 or above expected goals screams it screams it even the spurs even north london derby is going to be its goals just goals just goals and goals 15 versus 18 here at the moment has arsenal as a slight favorite which makes sense and its only the its only the promoted sides that are looking particularly weak at here all the teams play liverpool and city everon so i dont know lets just start with the with the middle line here which is liverpool forest and man city brenford and just say that both teams with a 46 chance of a clean cheat according to the data and so defenders are good doubling up on liverpool defense good city defender good but do you could you c anyone out of salo if outside of salo or harand this week i dont think its worth it i dont i just dont think its worth it like there will be people that will captain like a captain like a xiao pedro or bruno or a palmer they will therell be some random ones but i just dont think its worth it i think so guess the question back is like who would you captain out of salah and holland if you had both i have both and its its its its on harland not even a shadow of doubt for me on this one partially because i of the goals i expect him to be firmly involved in it but secondly is the worry for me on the liverpool one is the tuesday game is theres a potential that they take players off for me who owns jotter im thinking realistically best case best case situation for jot this week 65 probably dont like his its its probably best case isnt it this week for doter but mo plays a lot of minutes so youd expect him to play a lot of minutes but if they are pr up and they can get to free0 up in any game without that that can happen diaz and j can score many goals trent can score is sly can score they can theyve got many that can score but you do think for city if theyre fre now up harlands probably got the braak in them not saying that i dont think like the right thing the right thing here is they both walk away of about 13 15 points is thats what it should be this is a great game for each of them so if youve only got salah shouldnt be that fearful of its a brilliant time to have just salah if youve only got harland its great you just captain harland easy decision it if youve got both i havent seen many people with both that are c in mo thats interesting i dont know any chat might tell us if there is anyone in it but i havent seen any as far as im aware that ive got both the on captain m this weekend i dont i dont know whether weve spoken about the way that tom thomas frank sets up against city making it more difficult for them with that three at the back could it be again i think were all just waiting for one of them to blank right so that we can start of start working out what to do but i dont know i think i might i think i think probably if you if youve got harland and sally youre probably less covered on the city side in terms of covering like the outer bits whereas if if youre if youve got salah youve probably got a trent a robo a jotter a diaz that covers more of the liverpool side so having more of that coverage i think probably i would captain harland if i had both i think thats probably the way i would lean it is there is some more eggs in basket if you if you if you do mo with all the other bits around it but i do think just in general is i it would be in my mind as what is a factor then playing away in milan on tuesday night is a factor and thats probably it but you its a worth its not a bad gamble do what for those that those that want to load up that they got triple liverpool and they captain mo and harem blanks monster it dreaming like those things can happen too so who are the outer pieces then from the liverpool that you think are going to benefit the most we we spoke to jn and john was like diaz is like perfect because it suits salah it suits diaz on the other side as well weve got to wait and here from slot around the attacking options because to see if theres any signs that diaz might be an issue but we could get leaks theyre saturday games arent they so theres every chance that we could get some form of leak around these ones around diaz and and j to know theyre not playing if but trend obvious like it at some point its going to happen at some point he has got to attacking mat return i did think what john mam about robo was interesting because i think the quite a few people that would have watched the man united game would have said well he just played left center back so thats not the same as what trent was doing but it does remind me a bit the position that hes playing at the moment and john referenced it that he had some good goal it it does remind me a little bit of the vardal type way in the in the bigger games yes he might play left center back but in the games we on top he might just turn up at left forward he might just turn up at left forward and and he might just have some good goal threat in those games and hes taking huge number of set pieces so a guy if youd have thought if you have thought about vardal being 60 but with set pieces at the end of last season we might get that from rob we might i think the thing with trent is you know a little bit more you know what hes going to do every game hes going to play off the right with more goal scoring threat than we probably ever seen him maybe less assist thre than weve ever seen him people would say but the england game its interesting the england game in midweek where people would say what he got an assist his assist was like the worst thing he did all game what he did was put a huge number of good deliveries in during the game that didnt that didnt pay but was so outcome based its he got an assist that was just a tap and then kane did the rest but no i for me if i was wild card in this week i would probably do trent robo mo that be me okay where you sitting with it because youre on the wild card at the moment ive only got two of them right so ive only got two ive only im not tripling up on not triple liverpool no wow no not at the moment i feel like i want to get a balance between i feel like i want to get a balance between the best three teams in the country to be honest because theyve all got because theyve all got good fix just coming up in times right and so having transfers to move around pieces where fixtures change feels better feels like a better use of these transfers than having to move off sacka to salah which seems likeing madness when they both bang and moving off robertson to gabrielle which i might do anyway but it might be the only one i do for example so theres a couple of things there im thinking its interesting you spoke about you just mentioned about robo turning up at left forward im looking at spoiler alert ive got vardal and robertson in my in my i got two left forwards potentially in games like this in games like this so that could be that could be could be interesting whats your feel so i think how im going to play this but whats your feeling around going pretty heavy in on brighton for four and five and then softening slightly for six and seven i i like i like for bren as a keeper pick he would he would be in for me and id have i just need to have a look at the fixtures but ive ive seen some people say for bran and henderson might be quite a good longterm play if youre looking like 20 odd weeks i would do the double four point five so for bren and either probably might still stick with henerson as the other option for it johnston is probably the other one for me for ws better fixtures but havent fully played it through but for bren i would go i and i like him more than i like dunc as the as the as the defensive pick youd go j pedro thats not even a question for me and then i think it depends a little bit more on the number of transfers youve got youve got free transfers bit much more a much more interested in looking at m as a picture for me with one if i was going 55 or less on the five than rogers or seeno and i preference for me would be seo if i could have got it i think theres something theres something interesting to talk about talk about villa and theres a super chat which ill mention in just a second matt theres interesting theres interesting conversations to have around villa right now should we just go there just one im going to indulge mr rockstar in the chat because hes been abusing me all week on this one which is that ive been saying that trents been very lucky to get free clean sheets and what i would say is if youre looking at this right now on the screen the liverpool have a the best potential clean sheet odds this week at 46 less than a 50 chance doing it and theyve had less than a 50 each time so the idea that they got three heads in a row is lucky like theres no for any team that if they got four if they b this year thats more than thats thats more than the better odds of flipping a coin and getting four heads in a row getting four cleans in a row is pretty lucky is whats unlucky is the attacking returns so as i said what i said the other week was that people are saying my god should be 12 15 points and so forth could also have had twos cir he had two very good chances last in the last game and didnt take them and there is potential that you dont see as many points of it theres definitely potential when youve got the best clean sheet odds and youre a good attacker that he could score 20 points this weekend thats thats thats what you face into im as it stands got no trent and its going to require hits for me to get trent do i think about that very regularly probably hourly probably hourly like when im looking at this week as a person thats not on wild card and doesnt have the greatest team in the world this week im looking at this and going ive got no a that bothers me ive got no j pedro it bothers me ive got no it bothers me ive got no r lewis it bothers me ive got no palmer it bothers me i think its going to be the season at some point where everyones going to face into that at some point facing into that right now you spoke about you spoke about salahs minutes right like these minutes are g this is a 46 chance im we just we just roughly just say that this is based on them playing the whole game but you getting you reference milan right theyve got an extremely capable conor bradley just sitting there so well we might find that out though might we might find out what he might not even start are we even thinking that well find out if hes not mate but i think it i think it increases his chance of clean sheet again if hes very if hes likely to come off after 60 65 when he came off last game what was his baseline it was five worst baseline hes ever had it was nobodys nobodys buying trent for two or six so we can kill ourselves on that but what you do lose yes youll get increased chances of cleans but you do lose 20 of the attacking returns if youre coming off at 65 flapjack and rockstar sh just prom you wild card is he sliding on him lovely villas interesting because kza gets injured although hes okay i think hes okay well you get you gotta wait on that news you got wait on that news because carsley said i think hes okay i havent spoke to him so we got i think okay so there is that what watkins goes home from international duty hasnt been seen in training yet so theres that morgan rogers plays scores twice including a penalty so theres that good penalty like its a good pen good pen wa he did the call palmer celebration so hes on pens but any pen that goes into good pen funny thing is though right i know its i know it is ridiculous but play back the bit where palmer and sterling were fighting against in the luton game that was about the same was it game week four it was game week four i think last season where palmer rips the ball off of sterling and takes the penalty and at the time we didnt know he takes penalties and he did and suddenly we had a5 million pound penalty taker thats the only thing if you if youre like spreading around and you dont go rogers on w card and then he does take a penalty thats the real worry cu i think you had did you have pal wild card when we wild carded early last season i didnt and then i didnt get him for about eight to about eight or nine i didnt i had him like five and a half by the time sudden he lit like if he takes a penalty it be carnage its going to create absolute carnage hell be hell be 54 five well hell go up point two in a week hell be in for the rest hell be in till game week 38 thats he be he just be in be for the rest of just because the fixes are so good now it may like injury will be the only thing that takes him out but we had no idea that palmer was the big dog that he was and until he was so when he did that c i like expected celebration you never know you never know so but fill filla you got to you got you got there just not that many assets to go for is there like conza is there emmy is there watkins is there pes is there that is about not going to the rest there is a question so matt chat out thanks for the super chat he says will duran replace watkins as villas first choice number nine i dont think so i dont think so hell be impact plus maybe champions league may well maybe like coming in champions league games sometimes i think wed more likely see him when if slash when villa go out the champions league maybe they drop into europa is that does that is that still a thing i dont even know i dont even know if they can drop into europa but is he is he going to be first choice no i dont think so you dont come off a season like you did last year and then just be dropped after three games cuz youre a bit tired from the euros we have some we have some good analytics boys that watch our pod and do our stuff interesting for me this week is potential hits so when do i hit versus when do i wild card like im looking at some of these fixtures and surely everyone always says if youre going to if youre going to hit do it in a double game week but thats thats like the overall where its okay i do wonder about this we im still looking at it so ive got gabrielle should i be hitting gabrielle to robo should i hit should i bench gab gabrielle leave him there and hit hall to lewis start lewis rather than gabrielle like solves a problem gets lewis in maybe he stays in forever if jotter doesnt play i could even minus eight j to e and do gabrielle to trent like im pretty sure if the rules hadnt changed to you can carry five transfers over and theres people sitting on three transfers and all that stuff it wouldnt seem like the worst thing in the world but because there are people sitting with free transfers and rolling them fre wild card seems like the worst thing in the world but i am i do keep looking at these and thinking should i be playing gabrielle when i could just hit in lewis for example at the end of the season its going to be like thats a thats a meta question is whether we think at the end of the season the points titles are going to be higher than wed expect not versus all the seasons with the double game weeks but maybe higher than wed expected because we are having these extra transfers to play with essentially maybe that is the case and that probably then makes hits feel worse in that sense we said we said this we said this pregame one right we said this pregame week one like if you got if you got anywhere near having to take hits early on in the season you were going to look it was going to look its embarrassing bad it looks it looks like just utter failure but im like well im im also you look at me go in this week with porro and ive going with porro and gabrielle 17 22 how many points do you think i will lose as an estimate to those with lewis and trent you might get four lets say lets lets say four and you get lets say an assist from porro because we want spurs to score you get seven then you probably get lewis probably gets a clean so thats six maybe get a an assist thats nine trent gets 12 points or 18 points you just make it up immediately you might not because theyre both good players score ah header and could score youve also got then youve also then got lewis and you got trent for next week as well you wouldnt play lewis next week you wouldnt play lewis next week we got trent but you wouldnt play gabri probably wouldnt play lewis the next two weeks is the problem you probably wouldnt play leis the next two weeks and you certainly and you want gabrielle back six but then like a wild card you what so its so realistically its like do you take that risk this week if you think you might wild card in a couple of weeks its its a difficult one its a difficult one but i think there is definitely some sentiment in me that says well normally i would definitely be taking a hit this week but it feels grubby the only reason why i might take a hit rather than necessarily wild card is that this week ive got moan harland and on wild card like youre facing into im not sure whats the right decision im not sure if having both or if having one is the right play so do i think if you get to six i think if you get to six and your wild carding i think you just go harland right thats thats the thats the play you dont you dont get seller which maybe makes which maybe makes the route for wild card to start with salah and then work your way out back to harand maybe i think i was trying to do that anyway to be honest but right are we looking at any more here nah just to just to cover those big hitting players so the data the odds the bookies odds are expecting 113 goals from harland 68 chance of at least one goal which is it could be swingy this week if you look at it har and v are the top two on this list youve got j pedro at 61 and youve got munis 045 everyones got one of the other like ive got munes loads of people most people got j pedro j peds better but its not like its terrible youve got then you go watkins and isack exactly the same 059 each and mata sitting there a lot of people have got one of those three not many people have got two of those three j and diaz like its just there j and j and e like i went j over e in game week one because of the speculation around e im sitting and being like my god im scared of e realistically a people should be scared of j is there you phone arama all these ones it could swing it could swing in or they could just all score and then everyone just gets lots of points and everyones everyone gets points thats not how this game works its not how this game works im just let me i just wanted to remind myself how the what the timings of the games are like how will that everyone gets points but with everyones going to have points by the end of saturday theyre playing at the same time liverpool city play at 300 both of them this is so much worse for me right so cuz youve got hall and esack on sunday and spurs and arsenal on sunday and ive got ive got ive got gordon esack porro and gabrielle all playing sunday like my red arrow saturday night is just going to be legendary and then youre going to expect and then at 2 ocl youre a not going to care but b not going to get anything no so its just gonna its just going to be all on new car at 40 come join us sunday night ill be the most miserable man on earth no but no well youre gonna have like last game of the gw vibes thats what youre gonna have im just i just need totten to win true thats all we care about on tottenham which is on wild card if an says sank fit have you considered him yes theres a theres a lot around theres a lot around those four strikers right isach watkins havs salanki those four the spurs arsenal game makes salanki and havs a bit awkward and watkins and the problem is harland as well in the next four weeks so its you do need to you do need to sacrifice something in the midfield to make that happen now that can that we can talk about it when we get to my team but that can be done there are ways and means to get there but you have to go a couple of five fives but maybe just maybe its not watkins maybe its maybe its salanki and rogers instead of say bruno and watkins which is a lot cheaper but it frees up a lot of money but it gets you it gets you ahead on a transfer and then whatever the third striker is you could move that around to make things better with salah at stuff like that so you cant you can get around its just because salanki fixtures are good i good youd never bench salanki i think if youve got salanki hav sacka son any of those guys i think you just play them in this fixture because theyre i yes its like 18 versus 15 we know that we know that generally there are goals in in north london derbies they just are its like two tws and two ones and all this stuff that very regularly happens ive got to call out two things in the chat one is squidward who said that he wanted to take a hit for rico lewis but acent brought rico henry i just hope i hope thats true i hope its true its hilarious its hilarious and the funny thing is you just bench him for two weeks and then you play him and james morgan says best pot ever good lads love it love it lets look at fixtures lets look at fixtures sorry im clicking around before just before we look at fixtures i just wanted to just highlight something on the on the spreadex market just to show what can change during the week in terms of what data goes into this so rob t sent us this for tottenham versus arsenal so arsenal the red lines tottenham are the blue line and as time has progressed between the start of the international break where it was at like 18 for arsenal and then 13 for for tottenham in fact thats before the international break started and its after the spurs game so what happens there is over the early part of the international break arsenal get better like the book like the odds get better for arsenal and then we see a small rise and then theres a very slight rise for tottenham but the the thought is that tottenham defensively but its real close players get injured things change and its a lot closer now 17 155 i think it was 18 on the graphic before it be very interesting to see what happens if tomorrow we get confirmation that sank is okay and odard is not is because the thing is on odard right like immediately gets report hell miss three weeks because the doctor said that thing looks like itll be about three weeks before hes gone to see in arsenal we dont know we dont know i love the twitter physios as well love the twitter phos but its ominously quiet from tottenham which we keep seeing this happen during international breaks is we are very we are continuously last season we saw it this season were starting to see it is whenever theres a break you get nothing from social media from tottenham so we dont know if mickey vans okay we dont know if sank is okay if theyre both okay and odard not id be interested to see this but again an generally speaks like hell be ask those questions directly and hell generally just say mickeys okay dominics available hes dominics available for selection hell say stuff is problem is with those knocks especially in a big game what gabriel and s going do they got to kick him straight in if he is fit true its its a big risk going there in five but if we dont get any news on watkins and it seems like yes hes potentially okay theres always an out there because if if we go to the fixtures and have a look come gw five onwards for tottenham its an okay run brenford man united brighton west ham palace fellows which its okay if hes playing all the minutes hey he might even be 74 by the time you get to him maybe but weve also got very like weve also probably got the weakest well we definitely do have the weakest run of internet european as well in this in this spot i think i would be tempted i think i probably if watkins looks a bit dodgy i think i would probably just stick with isack walls and fulham that is the thing like the no the no europe thing is something that what this is this is this is the point in six weeks time we have that moment where we say next season we have to remember the team the good teams that dont have europe the teams that generally do better in this period and newcastle is that team like its that team look everybody else has got europe newcastle is that team so not having newcastle coverage in this period could hurt and may maybe it wont hurt instead of like in terms of rank but you what is you will you can be missing out on points i think more than anything ive got hope im sitting here with isack and gordon mate and its interesting it as an esack and gordon im not trying to im not feeling that narrative type things im like my god i dont want them but there is a hope there is a hope its certainly theyre not certainly not the team to or players to hit out there is a comment here that brighton are the best team not in europe yet well then thats arguable as well thats fair they are for the next couple of weeks yes but fix just turn pretty quickly but you dont mind it because theyre so cheap they are very cheap very cheap theyre so cheap we are into it now the danger the danger always of the wild card is before you see what happens i dont maybe thats a bit overplayed i think like i think it is a little overplayed like teams also at start season need to have a good start youve got to is its points on the board is important tottenham and chelsea for example with their europa ones they cant afford it they both weve both got like what we got four points or whatever four points one draw weeks we got to get going chelsea got to get going man united got to get going newcastle have had a good start but theyve got to make hey is nobody can afford to let up and if weve got a freeway title race they cant afford to let up either no there was something that i heard on the athletic last week in prep for speaking to john was that generally speaking the league table is in place by gw 10 like theres very little differentiation between game we if like game week 10 is the week where it has the least differentiation between the end of season result versus like the weeks previous to it so its generally by gw 10 the league is in its general spot there were a few exceptions tottenham and villa bas to tottenham villa and chelsea were the three big exceptions last year but everything else fell where they were so if youre not on the board by game week 10 like thats thats the thats the risk for all of these teams and i was saying to a guy today like playing golf and i was just saying to him i said its its a year where you ask fans where you think youre going to finish and any one of outside the top three there any one of villa tottenham chelsea newcastle man united brighton you can even add west ham fans sometimes in this conversation but the everyone is thinking fifth and up right everyone is thinking fifth and up some like the four the battle for fourth is going to be challenging vill have opened the door there havt theyve shown you can get on a run and just keep going and hold it its its people are going to want points means they got to play their players exactly i wouldnt i wouldnt be hugely worried about it might make some it might there might be some nuances around captaincy there might be some bits where we look at it and think okay but some of things also you got to cross the bridge when you come to it like you can easily say well psg games in between the leester and southampton gam so im not going to bother with all the all the arsenal players the great thing about the wild card this week you can make that decision when you get there as opposed to those that are wild carding like me probably game week six game week seven im going to be like okay what if i play it all and then they dont play its well well well well work it out when we get there but i do think everyone needs the points on the board hell be all right interesting that they got four home games in a row arsenal so its not like they have to travel which is nice for them that is nice is that is nice and the and the carabel one who cares who cares because they wont be playing anyone right so were going to move on to our teams now were 50 minutes in i saw i saw that i saw that go on you go for it from caris sima jotter to e im on triple liverpool with salah and trent i just think js if you find news that j is going to start how do you take him out like hes j if hes starting hes a very difficult man to take out with a free chance the issue is e is bench in a week time maybe in three weeks time definitely against liverpool but you probably dont want to i think because you can always keep those extra transfers now youre not using them all id rather have the transfer this week okay because its its comparable picture wise this week if theyre both starting next week you want jas still if i was wild card in and you said j or e id have e okay because youre not using a transfer yes agreed agreed its almost a shame its almost a shame hes like the only real example we can we can use id love to say would you do like j to cu because what i wanted to see was what would you do if the fixtures were better but were not living in that world because the only players we can look at that with are rogers mow i switch everton so its like well who cares about that so lets lets move on to teams if you havent done so already if you want to make sure you like the video if you do enjoy what were doing havent had a quick check how many likes we got on the video just for now just over a 100 so thats good just over 100 400 of you in there though so say 25 of the people watching us that is poor you are not on wild card so probably spend more time on mine im the man not even got petes fpl team up here we just got my good old screenshot of my phone move made no transfers in this is me grumpy me going to lose you have to read it out because for people who are listening on podcast mate so ive made my transfer in the week which was sack a salah ive got about half a million 4 in the bank but i would need to hit because i spent it taking sanky out and taking inko out and now doing the salar in so i got henderson and goal fingers crossed never know well youve got it thats thats an obvious one right you got like you just play henderson you will play henderson but even unlike if youre wild card in and if you have henderson you play so porro robinson and gabrielle starting dont have much choice because i havent got a bench got hall and johnson and z gar so a fun 11 pick themselves gordon rogers jotter salah and then moonis isack harand so im all done far as it goes if i was looking at any moves then it wouldnt take a huge amount for me a wild card you said this 10 days ago we said were just waiting for waiting for tomorrow to see what tomorrow says i think itll but i no i think itll i think ill be saying this every thursday night okay i think ill be saying it every day because while youve got like po gabrielle in place rather than say your trent and lewis which its so much more fun after a while it comes back to those players you what and maybe newcastle sort themselves out and youre like theyre not in europe maybe just hold them for a little bit longer because watkins doesnt look right and all those things so i am open that im dont necessarily wild card in six i might just run this into the ground and that might be if i cant ever get transfers in the bank maybe that is the play is the is the is that you leave it for a little while because i could easily for example do no transfer in five and in six i could do salah to sacka moon is to hs and ive got perfect triple arsenal ive already got harland in place and then im like well maybe ill leave it a few more weeks so im incredibly fragile in myos i hate my team i dont expect greed arrows you just try to stick around im just trying to stick around stick around stick around build some build some transfers build something build some stock but the worry is that if you dont have your gw one team absolutely it doesnt fully come off everything youve done with this new system of rolling five transfers and rolling them through wild cards might never catch up maybe no its going to be interesting to see especially mean you might be you might be just fighting a battle forever like we dont know we dont well this is it cu were going to be people are going to be having people are going to be starting their like their thoughts around bench boosters and all this stuff around and theres going to be people that are firefighting with no transfers versus people starting with like five transfers and going ah i can i can plot this but if im hanging in then i might just go what what maybe i should just keep hanging in for a bit more because maybe a different avenue opens up maybe there is 12 wild card 18 19 wild card something that just goes mystery ship here we go i feel absolutely dreadful for months trying to work through what it is but hey maybe come christmas itll all look pretty again lets get you mate youre the fun and before we do my team another super chat nial has said rate my team w card draft so ryan fabianski trent pal tores lewis mrai greaves salah palmer e boomer matoma isack hz ja game week six have free transfers to get sacka to sacka and harland in that looks outstanding its not going to not look outstanding this is true its its very nice very nice to give us some money but but were gonna say its good because its bloody good salah p booma is have having just having fun with mata thats who you bening this week buo grieve bumo and then hav you play mrai against southampton you play palmer you play a you play thats be i dont think you can play masra because youve been playing trent po lewis trent pow le maybe you maybe you play four man well if we dont know its goingon to be good thats good col says im sorry baker i seven of your starting lineup c what are you doing to me right here we go so this is this is where im get it out get it out get it out its not that its not that pod mate you asked me earlier you asked me like how many drafts do you have and i was like well like one two something like that because did i say this pre pod im pretty sure said this preot you said this preot mate cuz ive not seen it so i think people they might think weve been mucking about with this for the last two weeks no im seeing this now i havent seen it the first time at all for the first time because id rather have like one maybe two drafts rather than having 20 because i am the person that would have one or two and if the one or two goes wrong then okay its a bit annoying but thats where i was whereas if i had 20 and one of them absolutely smashed it or two of them absolutely smashed it and i didnt pick that one id be fum i just like well i had it i had the right one there outcome biased and whatever i would be i would be raging i would be raging so as of now i have a goalkeeper pairing of martinez and johnston villa fixtures are good all the way up until game week game 10 when they go away to spurs and when they go away to spurs wolves have palace at home and then they have southampton at home when villa have liverpool and then in the week that villa have chelsea away the wolves have got bournemouth at home so like theres theres a good rotation between those two i understand keepers its not a its not a rotation as such though its martinez is my main keeper johnson is the 4 four right johnson is the 44 and when villa have three tough away fixtures i just change it up okay its not its not rotating its not rotating back three of robertson lewis and vardal at the moment yes and ive got porro and leaf davis on the bench theres a lot of opportunity to play leaf davis from now up until 15 16 1 like theres just you can play them all the way up until 18 if you want so there he can come in and he will come in next week is the plan with southampton and porro fix is improve and its pedroo so thats where im at with that salah captain because theres no harland here yan kuminta e saaka bruno i cant i cant believe i cant believe ive got three wild through like a wild card draft and going im not dropping bruno but that southampton game is too much there is plans to like move bruno out because i just think you need boomo in six i just think you need boomo in six so theres a theres a very easy route to bumo there and then xiao pedro and ive got watkins so i cant see that watkins is just going to continue to not score goals because the fixtures are too good for that to happen so there is a there is a requirement that emory turns around and says oies fine hes good hes ready to go hes been helpful having these two weeks off etc its helped him rest and recuperate were confident da d da 65 minutes grabs a couple of goals gets subs for john duran dont care perfect thats fine that said there is a potential opportunity to go down to a salanki and then that means i can potentially do more with bruno money later on ive got a dead spot in my striker which again i dont mind i dont mind at all because im going to want to get to harland so i just want to im quite happy to run with harland in a four five one because as i said pedro parro and davis ill have vardal ill probably have gabrielle in in six so i cover the arsenal there with that i think its pretty balanced i like it thing is the extra by running five defenders effectively what were saying is ive seen teams say with wher for example as the third striker thats an extra one and a half million on stuart it is but davies leaf davis is only an extra five so its a million theres a million quid there its a lot of money to have somebody so where we always be like is mate for tacker i think if youve got five defenders and effectively youve always got cover for lewis now cuz you got five ers is theres theres a theres a lot there for it would you just from my references perro and davis would you play them both over vardal and lewis next week yes doesnt say because you dont do hedging so soaka plays right sasaka plays in that fixture has to play dont dont hedge because theres no theres planning on no transfer in five youre going to six with four transfers six with four transfers its so strong when im going to need so i am going to want bumo im probably going to want to move off of min in six as well and im going to want gabrielle so theres potentially theres potential like three book transfers in here does it does feel a bit icky like that but so the two looking at it that people would say look at this straight away and go its its tren and at stroke no f liverpool and its and its i just dont understand how harland gets in get i dont understand where the money comes from for harland like i just dont understand where it comes from like what do you do like this so this does have a million and a half in the bank this does have a million and a half in the bank just for wow a million and a half in the bank im pretty sure it does i ive got it built in fpl team so im just trying to work out whether im pretty sure i changed all the all the pricing on it im pretty sure this has a million and a half in the bank give me a second lets just check just check my lewis change transfer price lewis in price 46 this is million and a half in the bank im not i dont fully fathom ill be honest with you i dont fully fathom keeping a million and a half and not having trans and having free transfers because you got to move a player to move a player do what like its not th those type of stuff so i think most people watching will say just do vard trent but then that just creates a transfer doesnt create a transfer does it but i want i want vardal in seven so theres there it creates a transfer i have to make that trans so if i if i do that have to make the transfer though do you i dont have to make the transfer because trent could trent could just be the best defender in the game i think most people would expect it if people said like lets take a bet on whos whos going to score the most points in the game just have trent would you but if youre going to say like whos going to score the most points in is trent going to score more palace chelsea arsenal brighton or is it going to be viio fulham wolf southampton bournemouth but next week youre playing leaf davis over trent at home to southampton to bouth no i wouldnt rather have him just play just get train lose you cant lose its an extra transfer its not an extra transfer its not an extra transfer because you dont know that you would move trent out you dont know what youre going to do in game week seven this is game we four were true is in game week five and six like against at nori against at nori and six as opposed to go into newcastle ive got salah for that ive got salah you dont think you dont think over the next free that trent scores four points more than viio so even if you do use a tr youll have four of them maybe v trent i wont bother you about any of the others but v trend just seems big fair enough big fair enough for the rest of it solid is it like you cant i just worry i do i do just worry about le more than anything i do just worry about lewis say the information from lewis lets say lets say for whatever reason pep starts to manage minutes and walker comes in and something happens defenders mate you got five starting defenders so it comes four okay no thats fair porro and leis even on the hardest fixtures par and davis could score they could assist they could bonus they could score any game they have rooster points they very rarely walk away with two pointers okay i we take it into consideration on the trend thing and i can still do all the moves i want to do even if i do that so thinking i can i can still do it all i can still do it all if i want to do that just but there is there is like a if i even if i go like even if i get to gw seven theres a hit involved now based on what ive transfers you can do whatever you want no but im saying theres a theres a hit involved in game we seven if thats if i if i want if you have to make those seven transfers wherever it is by then minut but stuff will change we will see we will see thats thats if youre trying to run another wild card out in six we dont know you will im going to be fighting against people at that point we know theyre going to be fighting against wild carders at that point theyre going to be moving to players lets once lets say vardal scores against arsenal like hes just going to be the most owned defender in the game on wild card he just will be but you might go robo to him and keep trent do what youve got that option no but robo will already become gabrielle so its like you dont know these yet you dont know these yet theyre weeks away you dont but youre not youre youre not cutting yourself out from them no i you get tren if you get trent youre not cutting yourself course because you because youre at the price as youre at the price as well that means you can get anywhere so yes youre right youre not we weve if someone said to me well ive got trad for the next two ive wild carded ive got this amazing things im not the only person im taking on is harland and in two weeks time ill have four transfers youre in a pretty good position rock stars calling me out he say adam doesnt deserve trent off like i triple captain trent i believe in trent more than most people hes just winding both of us up with trent all night thats all hes doing thats all hes doing ah right i think were there mate i think were there so thats and if grad if youre watching thats my thats my team okay just so im not late for skw every hes like i said to him i said how the hell can i be late when i publicly put my team on

19,AboveAverageFPL,rVXFYd-BB98,FPL WILDCARD ACTIVE w/ @LetsTalkFPL | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-09-04T18:27:04Z,three game weeks in and we're now into the first International break some people have absolutely smashed it whether you had Harland whether you had Salah and especially if you have both now we got to start looking at the Wild Card windows and I think that my team needs a little bit of TLC so I've got Baker and we've got a very special guest to come and help me with it [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name is Adam and as always joined by Baker afternoon mate how you doing yeah I'm good good good good International break pressure is off couple of weeks FPL can't hurt you sort of sort of I feel like um yeah it's weird the very first couple of days is weird as well obviously with no football whatsoever uh it feels like everyone just goes into this weird lull like you know we're going to be talking about wild cards today but everyone was like the first couple of days it was like wild card wild card and then like it's Wednesday and everyone's like ah yeah we'll just need to calm down a little bit now um and you see that in like the prices more than anything right so the prices changed Sunday Monday and uh and now now it's kind of next to nothing it's just those you know those bits and Bobs going down yeah but International break so so we have to get a guest on and for anyone that's watching you can already see so we've got Andy Mir let's talk let's talk FPL how you doing Andy right doing good thanks very impressed you nailed that intro first time I did a I did a video with Luke earlier and I messed it up first time even though I've done my intro like a million times so yes well if anybody watched the recording of the intro at the start that was like take number 10 or something like that but that's that's just the way that's just the way it goes sometimes I'm not I'm not a pro like you Andy I mean I know you said you had to redo one but normally your stuff's one take isn't it well yeah the Finish bit's one take like if if I do three minutes for a five minute section I mess it up I start again from the beginning but not everything is done first time that's for sure okay it looks very good because you do navigate around the screen and stuff as you're going so uh yeah is H is very good but um yeah so I mean I'm here to talk about wild cards I mean you guys can talk about whatever you want really to be honest and I need probably some helpers to to make sure that I don't go in wrong direction make sure I'm not making mistakes something I'm very good at is making mistakes in FPL so yeah I could really uh could really lean on you guys so so you pressed it the button is pressed so I should have done it on Sunday because I missed a bunch of price changes but I caught one change on Monday where I didn't lose out on Gordon going down and I gained on seeno going up that was more kind of a placeholder for now um let's see if he goes up another 0.1 and I'm kind of obviously I'm glad I kept hold of harand I'm keeping Harland until such time as I may or may not take him out because obviously he's gone up another point one so I've banked that banked that for now that's where I am that's the thing in it it's double pain it's like one you've got if you if you take him out it's like you've got no Harland and then secondly it's like oh I've also lost some money and got to get it back so hard to take him out now as well isn't it like back toback Hatt tricks you gotta be brave to to wild card and remove him well that's what I I thought about Wild Card 3 we don't need to go into gameweek three in too much detail but I think I would have taken harand out and I would have missed that and that would have been an absolute killer and I think the the more hat tricks he scores the tougher it gets already don't it you got like I said you got to be brave to do that so I'm be interested to see if you're gonna do it we'll see we'll see just when when you when you only make one or two transfers you know you've got parameters is you so when you press the big button like you you can do so much that you can't help but oh well if I take out the person that costs the most how much extra do I get and it is a lot yeah yeah yeah and these teams these teams are doing really well that have just got Salah you know what I mean it's not like teams that have just got Salah are like oh my God season over yeah I mean it's obviously very different with being able to carry the transfers through as well because it like I was speaking to a couple of other mates of mine um who I do this mini league from an old work thing and mate M messaged me and said and he's probably listening back to this and he said you don't need to wild card and I was like well yeah but he said you've got transfers I was like yeah but I'm still going to have those transfers so they still exist so for me yeah it's a change up of the team but when you know when when fixers move around in six or even eight and 12 you know I'm I'm still ready I'm still can be ready I can set up the team in a way that you know makes it easy to switch from Liverpool to Arsenal for example grab a grab bumo and get him for the fixtures even potentially double up you know I can set up because if you get boomo on wild card then you can use a transfer to get whis and you can you know if you start with sacka then you don't have to bring him in in six and if you start with hav you don't have to bring him in in six and you know little things like that you can make work and you know by the time I come to game week six I'll have four transfers so I'm just I don't feel like it's I don't feel like it's a big thing I I mean as I said on Sunday I think I guess psychologically I was kind of hit with the 59 pointer and that's kind of hit me and you I'll always play the old my team my emotion type Vibes so you know it's just I I felt like it was a good time to to try and consolidate the position and just get back into a position of strength after I felt like it just dropped away a touch yeah I I think I think the um the the new rules around banking transfers is quite nice because I don't think anyone really knows exactly what the best way is to play it like again not to keep going back to the conversation with Luke but I was saying like if this was last shot I know exactly what I'm doing in five because there's no way I'm going to burn a transfer before a wild card it's so obvious but now the thinking is well actually maybe I just roll and I hope I get away with it and then I've got transfers coming out the back of it so like if I look at my team now I can't wild card and I've got no transfers banked so whatever I do on wild card would have to stick for a while but you're in a better position that you can go all in on Liverpool maybe less so on Arsenal knowing that you can easily get there and obviously because you're wild carding the hope would be as long as you go for some safe picks that outside of injuries you're going to be you're not going to be messing with with you know Quanza and Inu that some of us had to early on so I quite like the idea of going from a not a position of strength in terms of maybe the points but the transfers you've got I think could be handy yeah I I definitely lean into it more I I think anybody that's wild card in this week with free free transfers is in a really good position um orbe I think there is it does tempt you to take more sort of planned things that you might do they might do and might do you know I will um I would just say you know from scar issue that I have is the wild card in in game week five last year and I think I had something like nine injuries in five weeks ouch because hamstrings just go after first International breaks it's just it was you know for people can't remember it it's just everyone's hamstring disappeared um after you know once they started coming back and started playing European football and start playing league and um it it that things does happen um so I do think although it's really interesting that people are like yeah I've got these fre transfers and I'll do this and I'll do all these punts and so forth but you're going to be coming up against wild cards you know and and um except I learned from last year I wild carded in five I'm then having to use my transfers to concentrate on injuries and most people wild carded between eight and 10 and they had 15 fresh I mean and and um so I'd think about um some of those things and be like maybe I just pick a good pick so I think you know some interesting ones to for us to talk about today like Boos are really interesting one Way's fixtures are not so good for the next couple of games but then obviously get better and do you just think well I'll concentrate my transfer somewhere else because there there's other position where if you if you just have like a really strong team so you have like nine unbelievable players and then two that haven't got the greatest games but you kept your free transfers back then when everyone World carded you still didn't need they were World carding into the team so almost if you put the Wild Card six team in for the Wild Card 4 then potentially I think everyone said well what I'll use is I'll use my game week six to use all those transfers to keep up with them but why not almost let them play their hand keep your free transfers yeah because most of the Wild Card Sixers a lot of them haven't got them in hand I've got no transfers in hand and I will if I World carded in game week six I'd almost definitely have no transfers in same exactly 100% because I want Salah next week and it'll take me I'll have two transfers next week I want Salah it's going to cost me two transfers so yeah I'll be exactly the same so what you could do Adam is like literally match what I'm going to Wild Card in game week six you're probably still going to have a better team than me in game week four and five but then when I Wild Card you've got a similar team but you've still got those fre free transfers so rather than almost like guaranteeing that you're going to use them there's an inter we you don't plan much in yeah I would that I don't think I would like like got three transfers there's no way I'm wild carding with three book transfers like that would just be nuts and like I guess we can get into individual players in a minute but you know certain players I might be interested in Saving one for like instead of having sacka for Spurs away City away maybe you start with Palmer and then come down but I'm not I wouldn't like I don't know start on a 4.5 million Defender then I've pre-booked in two weeks it's just the chances of that coming off maybe Rico Lewis can do it right but most of the time that coming off is is not going to be worth it I don't think and so for the most for the most part I actually don't think you probably play it too differently you're just in a stronger position afterwards than you would have been in previous Seasons cool well thanks for the Pod guys that's much no but if you didn't do you think you would change what you'd do if you only had one free transfer I think I would probably be I think I would probably be I think I I I would like to be a little bit more aggressive with the wild card I think that's how I feel I want to play it and I know that kind of goes against what you guys have literally just said but it's interesting because we've got we've got we've had all the information now from from preseason come through to the end of the transfer deadline and we kind of know where the settled teams are now we are going to have a little bit of a hiccup when obviously Europe starts and we still don't know what that's going to look like because it looks like teams are playing you know tough games and then easier games and tough games and easier games and those for like pot two pot threes you know like a villa for example they're going to have pretty evenly matched games throughout and then just tough games so yeah I I kind I do kind of want to book a couple of transfers in because I think I think I can get away with it I think last year felt unusual that you got so many you specifically but generally there were so many injuries I know there's a few nigles around but last year there was just an inordinate amount of of injuries so I don't think I would hope that that doesn't repeat and I don't I don't want to hang my hat on it repeating um really in the absence the gain Advantage it might be why people my managers have been really tentative around some of these players that have come back to be fair there might be learns that we don't understand in the Sports Science World that the the the reason why people are being tentative with say you know Watkins is 60 minutes so far and foden and everybody else is that they're all like like I I I saw what happened last season and I'm going to try and protect against it now by not overexerting them in the first few weeks so the the the protection period might have already happened but um if if it happens and you can't plan for injuries but if you know injuries definitely definitely happen um it's and don't get you you will keep getting one transfer a week it's not like you got these free and then you don't get any more like is is is if you make this one so let's out well there's AB there's absolutely no reason there's absolutely no way I'm going to wild card into a team that needs a transfer next week that's like a given so I've got four transfers in gameweek six as far as I'm concerned I've got four transfers in gameweek six yeah depend well that still also depends on injuries like yeah um it's it's you know you can never guarantee these things um that those were the case but you should have you should have those many transfers yeah but i' yeah I'd also I mean you know I I would like to think I could set up the team that could handle a couple of injuries a squad I should say that could handle a couple of injuries as well so if I do get a niggle I mean look I've carried salanki for the last three weeks so it's not I don't feel like it's been a huge problem um carrying salanki for those for that for that period it hasn't like last week wasn't obviously great but you know two weeks ago it didn't affect my team whatsoever so there are there are there are still ways you can build your squad you know there there are enablers in there that that have good fixtures so I mean all you have to do is look at you know one person that's going to be in a lot of wild card teams I think is going to be Leaf Davis and I think you can play him in any week and I wouldn't maybe choose to play him in any week but I think if you can play him then fine like absolutely fine couple of Way games one of them is against Southampton four and five fine um you know others that people are looking at well I guess Southampton ones aren aren't really great but like Brighton's good for the next couple and then you want to bench him kind of anyway I guess uh Villa's good so if you're look on Morgan Rogers for example then seems fine no problem the only thing you're really going to stick is like a four million defender in I think and as long as you get one that plays I don't think it's a big deal yeah I wouldn't be particularly worried about injuries any more than I guess normal I know you got burnt last year like nine is mad like in five weeks but that doesn't tend to happen also I feel like a lot of the players that will be in our Wild Card teams like in game week four a lot of those players don't have like sacka Harland har maybe not quite so much right but Salah that they're not super injury prone players in bermo do you know what I mean so I think you'll probably be okay and you've already got three so like one or two punts is probably it's probably fine stuff can happen right that's that's always going to be the case but I don't think it would massively put me off I don't think I I guess the only other thing like maybe a slight concern is even though the transer shut I still feel like there's stuff to learn because some of those transfers went in quite late and so you don't know how it's going to affect the team even like salanki we' only seen him for one game so far and I we all we all know he's going to start but will he always playing 90 minutes who's gonna I'd love to know who's taking penalties between him and Son as well because that could have a big effect on how important sank is I still feel like there's information to learn and maybe holding back a future answers so that could be could be handy and if you Wild Card him now um would you have Holland and Salah I I think I probably would but that is it's definitely a reaction to what happened last game week because when I was putting Wild Card drafts together before gameweek 3 for like so before game week 3 happened but thinking about gameweek three and four I only had Salah and when I started looking at gameweek six it was only Harland and so the fact that I would now wild card with both that is a massive reaction and I I still think long term one or the other is is probably better because of the the rest of the squad you get but that will only come true if they stop scoring Hatt tricks or I know Salah didn't score a hat-trick but points wise it's the same same amount right you know what I mean um if that stops and will it happen probably right that we've seen that in previous years players don't just continue bang two three goals every single week even Harland right so I feel like long term but this week just it's a really annoying position I think because the fixtures in front of Liverpool I don't know how you can't go for Salah but then you've got a guy that's just called back-to-back hattricks that now has brenford at home he has Fulham at home in seven he has Southampton at home in nine so how can you not have him either so that's kind of where I'm at so I feel like in game week six I might talk myself go Salah because I'll have missed Forest at home Bournemouth at home but right now I think it's a struggle to go without both is where I'm at and with the amount of transfers you've got I guess you have got ways to spread the funds later potentially a bit easier than than I would for example if I was wild card in this week that does mean that you're essentially sacrificing son saaka son saaka Pala as a as a trio yeah I think you can still fit one in but definitely not more than one but then then how I mean yeah then then defense the defense looks really weak at that point you get you end up with like five million Defenders and four four million Defenders and stuff which and that that is why I still think long term it's not the play I think this is a really difficult week to because I feel like you if you're G to go one this week you go Salah right I think yeah yeah yeah and that feels really scary but that's not how we should play FPL but but also it's it's natural to to be worried about what's just happened and if if harand goes and bangs another hattick I know someone said to me the other day like he's got seven goals from 3xg I get it it's a bit of over points but this is also a guy that gets tons of chances most games so if he scores another hat-trick you can't really look back and say well that's a bit unlucky like you know it's possible so and that's where the that's why it's kind of it there is still I know it's it it feels like feels like Harlem would always have that share of goal for Man City it feels it it although salah's done very well in his share of goals so far the the other guys have also had loads of chances you know I mean is Diaz has had chances jot has had chances Trent's had chances you know so Li had chances they' they've all had chances so I still see a world where you could have a 3-0 and sellah is isn't involved I don't ever see a world where there's a free at Man City and Holland's not probably getting a BRAC in that world it's still feels still feels like all funnels to him yeah I think whatever you do you've just got to be able to hold your nerve for a few weeks and stick with it like you can't wild card with just one and then in game week four or five like sorry game week five or six just then Panic the other one in like you I guess you got to remember the reasons you did it right if you go Salah only and Harlem Banks hat well you knew that was possible right it shouldn't change yeah going forward but but and that's a long answer overall but I think I would go for both this week I think I would I just I think just the Arsenal and Newcastle fixes obviously are the ones I think that are going to soften the Harland train for people that are wild card in myself included definitely and just when you know the other the other sort of Premium opportunities or the premium options are have really really good fixtures so you get you could have Palmer for Bournemouth and West Ham and then you can have sacka for Leicester and Southampton and then you can flip on down to son and he's got West Ham and Palace and you know there are and then you add six million around the rest of your squad when you do that or five million around the rest of your squad and you can you can dip into all the other better fixtures as well I'm seeing that now I feel like I'm seeing feel like I'm seeing the light um on that and you know I also feel there there's an over Reliance on the premiums if you do it that way if you do it that way and you get Harland and Salah like if they if if they don't both return significantly in a week you're staring at like a 25p pointer like that's a realistic potential week yeah I think the other thing to maybe point out as well is we've only had three weeks like things are going to change it always happens in FPL and right now a lot of people with harand and Salah or or the drafts they're building with both have got like cheap players that have done well that might not continue it might be that seeno is now a breakout 5.5 million he's going to keep getting I mean he's got three returns in three right maybe he goes to a return every other game is HE capable of doing that possibly but I'm not sure people would bet that much money same with Smith roow right I think he's probably a good option and he has scored already but we haven't seen him properly regularly for like two three years right so it's great when these cheapes are doing well but as soon as hav well that he's already doing all right but hav Watkins maybe isak starts like isak's done nothing so far right well sorry he's got a goal and an assist I get that but we expected more for the fixtures they had yeah so I think you need those eight to nine million players to start doing better than they have and for the defensive picks that are also more expensive to start coming in and once that happens like you said harand and Salah don't go and score 17 points every week all of a sudden that will flip around but but I honestly think that's where you've got to hold your nerve if that's the way you go you've got to wait for that to to work out and just not panic when the cheapy start or or continue to do well I just I just wouldn't see it happening forever do you know what I mean just because it's working for the first three weeks does not mean it'll work for the next three Etc so I agree with what you're saying about the overall Squad I just don't know if I'd be brave enough to do it this week that's all yeah um if I can ask about two others that people look at Wild Card I'll ask the cheap version First Rico Lewis but uh for me for me um I I would almost want him as a fifth Defender I don't think I want to leave myself in a position where I've got to play him any higher than that maybe fourth Defender and like if you're going for a saleron draft and you've got like Trent and Robertson maybe like a por or someone maybe that would be then okay to have him as well I I I don't know what I need to see before I'm comfortable with Rico it's probably another 10 games without KY Walker but um it's looking good like you know Luke talking about on Twitter and stuff that he he thinks for Walker to come in like one or two things has to happen um system change from what they've been playing or Jon stones to invert instead of Rico Lewis and then K Walker to be basically part of a back three in possession are either those things going to happen when they're playing so well right now possibly I think I think he's a worthwhile pump because he's so cheap yeah I've got like I've got no interest in Savio or dku or anyone like that just don't think it's worth it but 4.6 million Defender for Man City that's like getting into number 10 like positions is I feel like even I could be temped to buy a punt on that you know and I wouldn't usually feels like a Golden Goose isn't it really I mean the difficult the thing is as you say like you don't want any of the other Man City players really like there's no other real options um people aren't even talking about Edison this year so you know no one's not yet not yet no one's no one's no one's going into tripling up on on City because again we just don't know what's going to happen around Europe Etc and you know we're still waiting for foden to come back we're still waiting for rodri to come back so yeah I think it's I I'm pretty comfortable in taking taking that punt um weirdly I just checked my salad team and I forgot to put him in but perfect so I'll have to I'll have to fix that um and I was going to say something else and I cannot remember so if I remember I'll say it again just to cheap I just I would he would be straight in for me I wouldn't I wouldn't I would be overthinking that that's what I was going to say I mean the only other thing maybe is around the champions league is that whether whether he looks to use Lewis Moore in the Champions League and then brings Walker in for the Premier League games you we don't know how that rotation expect the other way around though would it might be it might be the other way around it might very well be the other way around and that might be the way to keep Walker you know from in terms of getting his minutes in there I'd expect it the other way around if anything especially as in theory every almost every team that's City and to play in the Champions League are weaker than them so shouldn't be too tough just that extra leadership midweek you know all these things it's just this it it just works I think um or at Luke will always tell us that he's got specific plan so it won't be that he'll just rotate for that it will be because this suits Walker skill set and this suits Lewis's skill set he'll tell us very different in that world but hey I think I think the Arsenal game is going to be the real test but unfortunately if you're wild card and four you can't wait for that if he plays that game I think he'll be in on my wild C six like absolutely no no question absolutely I don't think you play him in that g in that week anyway like if you've got him you don't play him in that week anyway so I don't think it's not it's not a huge huge issue no more that if he plays in such a big game then he's there locked in for the future yeah yeah but not for the whole season because he's a man City player but you know what I mean enough that I'd be confident to go for him yeah yeah Fair yeah he'd be he'd be in um and then the other one because you know one of the one of the ways that you potentially afford a Harland and um Salah draft is maybe not having Trent but um is Trent just essential well I've got him right now on my actual team not wild card and I'm very glad about that and again Liverpool next two fixtures it feels pretty again it feels crazy like it's such a tough time to wild card and not go for the best options from those teams but on a harand Salah draft it's very difficult to fit them in like it just is like for me e and Burma are just Nob brainers so they would definitely be in you've got Salah anyway so you've only got two more Midfield spots like I said I I would want to try and fit someone like sakur in as well or Palmer and at that point Trent's not getting in as well so I think he is great and I would definitely have him I think if I was going for one or the other or at least I'd try and fit him in but I don't know if he's essential I don't know if I'd class him at that level and he keeps getting subbed early as well which is nice for clean sheets but it also kind of tells you that maybe at some point in between the Champions League game Conor Bradley might get a start possibly I don't think that's necessarily going to happen soon but I think he's good enough I don't don't think he's got any problems no no problems chucking him in there like there's a drop off obviously every right back is a drop off pretty much from Trent but it's not it's not you're worried about it's not like Simas on the other side like I think Conor Bradley's a you know a step up um level wise so that wouldn't stop me buying Trent by the way but it's in the back of my mind that maybe that could happen at some point I've got a hope that lot I don't own Trent um it's absolutely horrific watching every game not only Trent so just for anyone who's doing it and not going is horrible um but um and you know I've heard I've heard nothing but from Trent owners oh God we've been so unlucky should be 15 20 points everyone's completely ignoring the fact that they've got three cleans in a row that had eight cleans in the whole of last season yeah they've conceded minus 2.2 XG which is good which is unbelievable but still free cleans is unbelievably lucky when you've conceded minus 2.2 XG there's never any balance on that there's only that um is so in terms of terms of points that have been seed it's probably about right he should have some attacking returns but he also shouldn't have as many clean as he's had um the the bit you're buying into if you get him now or the next few games is there's definitely a chance he could get a 15 20 pointer in the next two games yeah is he's you know a few millimeters away from that in the last game even with being subbed off um that's definitely the bit but I have people been hard done by on it really mate you got 20 points yeah I don't feel hard done by with Trent I know I know he's put up the numbers to maybe get an attacking return but I think he's done just fine we just know there's the capability of doing more don't we I mean what do you think of I don't know if you've looked at like Liverpool's longer term fixtures because after the two home games it's then two away games wolves and Palace then it's Chelsea at home Arsenal away then then even the two home games after that of Brighton and Villa who we'd probably have down as pretty decent attacking sides but I also there's another angle which makes you look at them think they're actually all right if they're going to be this good defensively and but they've not they've not been tested that much so far but if they're going to be this good defensively and we know what his attacking output is maybe those pictures aren't as bad as they potentially look on paper don't what you guys think about them I don't think they I don't think you're bang on I don't think they're that bad at all I think they are good I think that obviously that Arsenal away game is a tough game but city is at home in 13 that'll be that's not going to be a game for a clean sheet but it's going to be a game for for fun and the rest of them I think absolutely fine I think they're all good fixtures I don't think there's a need so there's a lot of people that are going to be forcing theel there will be people that will be forcing themselves to go from Salah to sacka in seven around there I think that's feels like a mistake I think I feel like to plan it just a hattick just goes well hard scores a hat trick and he's only like whoa well he's going to you know if Sal scores hat tricks against forest bmer from wolves taking him out yeah no no he's not going to go anywhere no chance um I don't right now I don't see me having Salah on wild card and six but again if he gets back toback hat tricks like Harland has the conversation might be a bit different yeah yeah it'd be difficult probably to have obviously we know it's difficult we literally talked about it to have harand to have Salah to have Trent and to have a 10 million is tough not un impossible to do it you end up with um a lot of pain um in other areas you know a lot of sacrifice in other areas um can you imagine that in the previous season the previous season so equating that can you imagine last season or the season before saying I'm going to have four 11.5 million pound players you'd be like what the what the hell are you doing surely you've got to surely one of those has got to be an 8 million a 9 million like it just it just is too much money I guess the only potential is though is that all teams are scoring we're just literally seeing one week where only one team kept to clean so everyone's scoring mhm and we have got these groups of teams that have lovely fixture runs that are quite cheap you know Villa assets obviously bar Watkins are cheap since why people look at their Defenders and look at Rogers you've got obviously Brighton into this um situation we've had Forest um and forest Run gets good again in about week eight onwards it starts getting really really good again wolves have got an incredible run coming like three or four weeks and then everyone's going to be like nor please right umuna is obviously real cheap um even bizarrely like I I've looked potentially if I was wanting to go cheap on it is I actually don't think Jamie vardy is the most horrific pick on Earth if you could bench him occasionally like there is in amongst the horribleness for it he did still manage to just play 90 minutes which is it's quite impressive from J Mardy but you've got some some biggies like Bournemouth um at home I think it's seven is it and then Forest at home in nine and even ipswitch away and you got Chelsea at home West Ham at home Brighton at home walls at home these are all in the first half of the season I was going to say that that run of six games that run of six games Everton home then then arsenal when you just benched yeah Bournemouth Southampton Forest hips which is a run of four games is about as good as you want yeah Leaf Davis wha you know what I mean these guys and so there are there are a load of good Chief players and we haven't me you know literally wax lyrical about SEO but at 5 and a half but that run gets good it might be that you know we've said these these first few weeks is like wow Salah and harling have done amazing um and stuff but it may be as much as we say they probably won't continue these five and a halfs they might they might and there's enough of them you're right especially cheap forwards there are a ton of options that are playing and you know like this Burma is the penalty taker right we know that but Visa just keeps scoring he did at the end of last season I believe as well he's an option vardy you've mentioned CA you said I'm sure like even calv lein I've I've looked at as well who you know what I mean he'll come in play a little bit even Bowen's not expensive I mean he's definitely not expensive um C just keep going D McNeil put in now we've gone too far yeah too far too far um but there there is there is an array of them so you might find that if you went on wild card with both the big boys you might find there is always an option out for you I mean and kka would be five and a half by the time he starts starting it's weird because we've always like in the past as well we talking about rotating premiums and I think two years ago we were talking about rotating 8 million mids and now now we've evolved to rotating five and a half million players we just slowly getting cheaper maybe that's maybe that's the way maybe that's the good are that good do you know I mean like if you if you just literally said right I've never T taken out Harland sacka Paul harand sacka Salah and Trent let's just say those four so never just they'll sit there those four players are do pretty well for the season and you always kept one of them I I to be honest at least for probably the next 10 12 game weeks I I also see e and Burma in that same category that once they're in you're just not messing with them unless they get injured which could happen I think a missed a few good few games last year but I I honestly see them say like anyone that wild CS this week of har and salad you're keeping them for ages and you're keeping a and Burma as well and then okay maybe if you start with a Liverpool Defender you might switch to an Arsenal one but I know it always sounds good in theory right that's great you just put your team together and you just don't ever have to worry about it of course stuff will happen but in theory there are a lot of players that you could just hold on to and actually the the the transferring cheapes if you've got the the spare um Bank transfers it could be could be the way to go team should have a look at a couple well let's start with the let's start with harand and Salah well let's start no yeah let's start with harand and Salah so not these are very much draft uh draft teams but you know there's some there's definitely some strengths in them um so for those listening I've got Martinez in goal just think Villa's fixtures for the next X week are are very good and then a back three are Robinson Dunc and Lewis and then my other Defenders are porro and Harwood Bellis it's basically porro plus a 4 million um and to say my other keeper is going to be a 4 million I I would pray caution on um fabianski I don't think there's anything really wrong with arola and plus if people Pile in on him the next thing you know he' be 3.9 so I wouldn't go there Midfield Salah e Bruno Rogers and bumo um and then jaal Pedro and Harland and then Ross Stewart on the bench four and a half million could be whoever to be honest I think that's a way to make it work I think this one had about point six in the bank for what I've got but obviously everyone's team value is different I the the player that does worry me in this one is is really just Rogers and then the fact that I've got basically two players on my bench that I just don't want to play um on Keepers although let's just say fabianski is your reserve keeper and he drops to two and a half million does it matter you you might not change him again for 30 for the rest of the season so even if he loses man he does it but the only thing with arola is like do you not think when he when he went off the other day he's like it he doesn't play 38 games it does happen yeah it's not the first time he's been subbed off all that to do stuff with it um if anyone's likely to potentially get injured in terms of if you offer me like bets on a first team keeper to get injured arola would probably be my first bet if I was looking at it w like the last man standing and you who do I think who do I think like first man out type things I'd probably bet on arola he does seem to find ways for it so I I wouldn't care if fabianski drops because next time you're going to change your kit your reserve keeper is going to be you're not going to care by then yeah maybe like it's only ever change they change once isn't it if if if that yeah um I don't think we need to spend too much time talking about it well are you gonna tell me that you think arola is a good pick then from W Cott no I think a good pick but but I was going to suggest a rotation a rotation well I just think we've got a couple of gifts in that we've had a couple of Keepers transfer which means that we get a couple of Keepers that have already dropped that are now First Choice so we obviously we get Rams out and we get Johnston um now if John I'm I'm not going to say ramsdale I don't think Southampton is a keeper that I kind of want in my life um but on Johnston the reason apparently he didn't play was to do with zy links and all those type stuff by the time the game comes around to play again we might know that Jose s's not at the club and then you've got 4.4 ramsdale sorry 4.4 Johnston as your backup keeper um and you know if you go to um walls as I said from 10 uh is it 10 yeah Crystal Palace at home Southampton at home Fulham away Bournemouth at home Everton away West Ham away I switch home leester away man united home Tottenham away Forest at home it's it's an unbelievable run the later wild carders I think they all going to be like oh I've got 4.4 keeper um that sits there but you can save just a bit of money so if you can find a four and a half that you like then I I don't mind it and I think with dunk for example we've seen so far the he he's nowhere near and I can't see a world unless he scores that he's ever near the bonus because you've got Pedro as a penalty taker so and you've got well backck you've got two Strikers that are on the pitch you've got Wingers that are really tricky they get fouled a lot so if they score they're both Baseline is pretty good M has been really good then you've got all action blind next to him in Van heck who always TRS his M bonus so he's never going to beat him and then you've got potentially k oglo and a Stan all those guys it's like and then their Baseline for their keeper is always and has been for years now steel or Bren if they keep it they're they're like 1819 on their Baseline that I'm like I think I would potentially take a punt on ver buen and Johnston and it's like make saves like 0.1 million or whatever than what Martinez does but gives me two playing keepers two long-term options um not the the world's greatest fixtures for either team in that sort of like seven to nine bracket but if I was looking at a pair they'd probably be the pair that I'd look at I think only sorry I was gonna say I think and don't quote me on this it would be the same price I believe fleing and ver Bren also rotate really nicely but I know guys don't like fleing that much but that's s like yeah but but brenford and Brighton I think rotate pretty good as well so it could be another one four home games straight out the bat from the wild card with that rotation just sucks though they're like it it does of course it sucks by the way we should we should treat go is like any other player like when dunk plays terrible fixtures you're going to bring in a different 4.5 with your bench right but for goalkeepers there's just this psychological thing that they will go and haul in a bad fixture and it's going to kill you when they when it happens but that's not how we should think about it but we do my only thing on Emmy right is that since the start of last season they've kept eight cleans a five million count ban keeper that's kept eight cleans in 41 games feels it then when you look at the cleans that he's kept so twice against Arsenal once against City Once against Chelsea he's like such a big game player like they actually quite often concede against their easier fixtures you know know the basically Sheffield United and Everton are the only teams really that then else have kept them giving them cleans you know so um the the big positive because he keeps those cleans then in big games of course he makes loads of saves so in like the eight cleans he's had he's got 16 bonus of those and in those and he gets sa points in all of them so he does have that propensity that they keep cleans but it's like what we're really looking at is we want to pick him now because he's got those easier fixtures and you're like well yeah one it's really annoying if you're paid 5 million he gets a two pointer but two he's kind of little bit less likely to get those those um the the bonus and the saves from these ones that makes me think like is it does it look really good but doesn't actually play out that way one one of the things I think is a big positive though is Anana um we're already starting to see that so they were pretty much the worst setpiece team in the world last season you know is is they conceded 109 shots from set pieces 14 XG from set pieces I think 18 goals it was in the end it's more than Tottenham and we are literally horrific this season they've only conceded four chances from set plays .14 XG from set plays and they've played Arsenal like Anana is so big the the I spent all summer telling every Spurs fan that listen we just got to sign onano because it just fixes everything he literally fixes everything in set plays so if I'm like well yes they've been rubbish but it could be okay it's all AR and aror um I would suggest that's there but um is that set p is that set piece coach they've got is he new as well because obviously they scor the set piece I think they might I mean yeah they've been working on Z Poli you get double benefit from that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't mind the Martinez pick to be honest I quite it's just a fixes play is it one this question does relate to the goalkeeper even though it's a completely different position what's with this draft what's the gameweek six plan to get sacker in in particular or or or you going to go without that uh yeah it's a challenge to get sacker in because you're not going to want to take Salah out are you not really not really um it's probably a harand sale oh before F at in game seven at seven justes it just makes no sense like they say this this was thrown together last minute because I've been focusing primarily on no Harland yeah um and more on just Salah on his own so the reason I ask is because I put a a team together very similar to this but it does have sacker instead instead of Bruno Fernandez because I'm just sick of the sight of him already um and I guess that's where like a cheap like forget the 4.5 rotations just a 4.5 would free up 0.5 then you've got 6 in the banks that's one and then I guess it depends how tired you are to Pedro parro just reminding myself now let me just let me remind myself how much is in the bank here let me just refresh I'm pretty sure it's similar to the what like if you if you drop parro to another 4.5 and then so for me there's 1.1 in the bank on this one oh really wow even better so you could just drop Martinez to a 4.5 keep por and you still have enough money to get sacka yeah just go direct Bruno to sacka so this exact team as well you could put you could to put Tren in I could just put Trent in yeah instead of robber you could just put Trent in so people were looking at it and thinking you can't T well you could just SW that in um but do you not like do you not think okay let's let's just say you go for the 4.5 keeper whoever it is like at that point and then it comes down to combination thing Trent and Fernandez or Robertson and sacka I know it's not quite the same difference but when you put it like that I think it gets a lot harder to justify Trent yeah that does just that I love this is why people listen to you is that you're looking at all these you're looking at the proper players I'm like 4.5 I was about to say also 4.0 Defender you got to go moscara moscara because again that W you're not you're not doing a 4.0 for the next few weeks you don't care about it for the next few weeks so do it when the later so moso is playing every minute he's 4.0 he's he's your Chuck in nailed on 4.0 Defender for me definitely that that's why I said earlier that Trent is brilliant but he's just not an essential status for me because when you try fitting in everyone else like something has to give and I think in certain situations he's the one to give like in in this case I would definitely rather have Robertson and sacka than Fernandez and Trent and again there's 0. five left over for the Fernandez um Trent one but I still think it's worth just spending it and just getting s you like you will want sacker in gameweek six I feel that there's no doubt about that like odard maybe he turns things around by them but even if he does he's still not as good a sacker um I just don't think you can go through Leicester at home and Southampton at home without him just I am actually 0 one short so I'll be01 short point one short how how tired are you to parro that's true like parro could be parro could be different yeah probably could be different so then that then that just makes the money happen yeah so I I the team I built is got a 4.5 fleen it could be anyone else I've got Minter instead of Rogers but to fund that I've got mikeno instead of par so that's the 0. one saving there and obviously Rico Lewis has gone up I didn't have him in my team so I know Everton have been terrible so far but the fixtures aren't that bad and he's like a fifth Defender I don't know yeah you still got to just keep playing yeah I think you're right you still got keep playing the fixtures yeah absolutely but yeah I think sack is a big consideration for me for sure well then let's have a look at this obviously it doesn't have uh it doesn't have earling so this is just Mo well I say just Mo like he has some friends um but this one's got 4.5 uh well got Henderson and Martinez together this is just throwing money around cuz you got so much you in the bank as well just for banter ridicul so the defense is dunk Trent and Robo and then porro and leaf Davis on the bench and then I've got E sacka Bruno Salah and M just because you know that ipswitch have conceded down that flank every single game and that and they've conceded from the right midfielder or the right forward every single game they've they've had returns so um being termism like I am m in there and then Xiao Pedro Watkins and then and then Ross Stewart again so I know I know you don't like the Watkins well I don't know whether you don't like the Watkins because you you gave me a little comment on Twitter last night I don't know what you were trying to what you were trying to say on Twitter I was just jabbing you on Twitter basically because it was like it's the same old thing that everyone will always use is the is the a person pulls out of an international break like fixes fake injury it's a fake injuries that's a positive for my team and it's like but he's not been playing like he's not been playing so if you want him in your team you're going to be like well what I'm going to do now is be like there's no objectivity whatsoever it's just my subjective is this fits my budget so what I will do is just say that that's going to be okay whereas I'm like Hey listen for it to be okay it could be yeah yeah but let's not pretend it's okay it's definitely it's never going to be good the best news was that he went away with England he played 90 minutes England that was that's that's the only positive that could happen in terms of Watkins in the international Break um everything else is bad like it it's it's it's always it's not even bad it creates more questions and we will get less answers because Em's never going to say oh yeah by the way yeah he going to play 60 minutes again this week I'm going to take him off for 30 minutes he he might does is Emory the kind of got I mean I don't know what she's press as normally is he kind of guy he's been saying it every week so far is he well not he's going to play 60 minutes but if he's asked whether 's ready is he gonna say yes or no I mean I'm I'm definitely paraphrasing I can't remember exactly what he said but I'm pretty sure he said before the third game that now after the first two games his minutes will be better and actually they were the worst of the the first three games so like International break injuries that they're usually rubbish and I look at the three that England have had like Cole Palmer I'm sure he's absolutely fine Phil foden there's definitely something wrong there because he's been ill right so even if it's not major maybe there is reason they've kept him behind Watkins could be good if it's just a small thing that he needs recovery time rather than playing time but you're not going to get that info obviously like you said but it would worry the Watkins one worries me the most out of the three because he hasn't played that much yeah there's something there there's something there now would it put me off buying him probably not if we know him he says he's fine because the fixures are so good but but I am I'm not as confident about buying Watkins right now as I would have been if you'd asked me in preseason what my gameweek four wild card team was going to look like and it would have definitely had Watkins I think everyone was talking about him right isaach to Watkins easy move all of a sudden it just doesn't look as good because he's he's just not getting the minutes Duran keeps scoring it's not helping and not that he's going to get replaced right but it just means you can make those substitutions with the confidence that the guy coming on is playing all right and also we don't know how champions league is going to affect Viller like I I'm not sure if Watkins is going to be a 90 minute man every week around Champions League so I my thinking is with Watkins is his minutes will go up from where they've been because it's very difficult for them not to but they may come down from where they were last year yeah is kind of what my thinking is right now but I agree that the England thing is probably with him more of a worry than like if I own Cole palman I would not be worried whatsoever but Watkins I'd be a little bit I would still have him though do I mean if I was in this draft and you ask me who I'm going to put in there I still would I would have Watkin but if I knew that he was training on the week leading up because if he's not training you would OB wouldn't bother but but if you knew he was training would I think he loses his place no do I think the worst case situation is he comes off 65 second minutes yes do I think the best Cas situation is he's got amazing pictur he plays United yes so therefore is um is I would definitely he would definitely be in my team um but I would still also have that worry like even more even stupid stuff like you've got the Vice Captain on this I know you wouldn't know but I'll be like not doing that um like he suddenly I don't think he could possibly be a captain option for example um yeah in games yeah and and obviously obviously he sits here as like the still sits here as a second most expensive Striker so he is kind of just he's there if emry says no he's not ready he becomes whoever he needs to be I don't I don't feel across the Midfield like there's anybody that I would I mean I would probably just come down in price on him and that would make getting to bumo easier well and you need to have a conversation about Bruno Fernandez you're the man united fan here yeah I'll I'll ask the question first I would ask you is do you think if you hadn't had Bruno Fernandez for game weeks one to three you would have him in your gameweek four wild card no probably not because a bit like Harlem right like as much as we shouldn't be affected by points scored we are like we we all are and like yeah and also I know it happens all the time where man united fans over at massively after games even I had a slight dig at ten hog afterwards on Twitter about the exx players and stuff but but they are not good still I don't think and it's like okay wellar is coming in so that would be good garro is starting out to that would be good holand might be back but it's all miks and ifs and I don't know I just Southampton always fine I I'm I'm happy to have him this week I think that's fine but I don't think Crystal Palace away is gonna be that easy I think your boys won't be easy like if you're on it and you're pressing as high and there's no like Martinez was just he had no one to pass to half the time it's not that he can't do it he just didn't have anyone to pass it and Spurs will not let that up Viller away is not that easy either the fixures after that get pretty good yeah I I I don't know I part of it's a man united thing but I just find it very frustrating with him when he's not there's certain players when they don't return like e for example first two games didn't care keeping him great great option going forward Fernandez is just you always want to get rid of him because he's that little bit more expensive so he's got to deliver a bit more so there there is a bit of bias there but I'd find it he's not in my gameweek six plans put it that way not right now and I know I know Adam will beat himself up if he doesn't have Fernandez having had in for three weeks and then he hammers it versus sampton yeah it will make him Furious I can say I be angry I will be angry be real real angry I feel like you've got I feel like you got to have him [ __ ] I I you trans later I guess yeah yeah game six like without Shadow but I just don't I can't see a world where I choose to make a transfer to bring him in so I feel like I need to have him in now and then when I get to game week nine I've got the I've got him uh sorry game week yeah eight game week eight yeah for the brenford game I've I've got him and he's in place and you know as you say hopefully I guess um like hope dropped in price another half million there's that but hopefully like hopefully from an FPL perspective you know United are up to speed and they're actually yeah they're actually starting to generate some proper chances and he invariably has to be involved like it has to be well it has to be either him or gacho really that's creating for United I can't see it coming from anywhere else yeah I I yeah I wouldn't I don't know like I don't think he's a bad pick I just don't and you know again one of those chances goes in against Fulham and all of a sudden the narrative changes while he was a bit unlucky against Brighton with the xery knee and then okay well he played Liverpool that can happen and the narrative is a bit different it's just what but then everything's different if if players score points right so yeah I don't know I I like I've just that's what I've been doing in the background I've been putting that team into the FPL page just to see how the money goes and it's quite a lot of like you could have him Burma in that spot ready to go and then suddenly you got like over two million to spend elsewhere maybe then Stewart goes up to someone else you don't have to playing bermo this week but where but Stuart goes well Stuart goes up to the only player that's I would want around 6 million is is wher and he's got the same problem as in Burma with the fixture so I just don't know where that money would go unless it went into defense or unless Watkins comes down but then the only way Watkins comes down and then Bruno comes down and I go up somewhere else because then I can take him up rather than down or I can take Min up rather than down for example is to is if sank is fit but then there's it's it's Arsenal so the problem the thing with salanki obviously is beyond that like fixtures for Spurs are really really good so brenford United Brighton West Ham Palace Villa like that's that's a decent run of fixtures and there's going to be a lot of people in gameweek six looking at that and going well that's that I'll get salanki and thanks very much um and like even I I feel like I can't get in on Arsenal now because of the fixtures for the next two games there's little things that I just can't quite get my head straight on how much money did you say you got in the bank for this half a million so if if you were even if you were keeping Bruno but you wanted Mente to go to um bumo you need one and a half million yeah so million well again there's also parro to look at whoever I do I do think the Brighton triple up as in dunk m you know I just literally just looked on the old it's a bit Fierce um Hub ticker and and went I just I just went started at week six and just put a random week in which was 24 I put it to um and Brighton were the bottom out of all 20 teams as a fix around that's bottom like like so very quick like so I'm like do I see Dunc and M on any game week six wild cards like none any they're now and they're good fixtures that's why a lot of people had them on gameing one and why they're good then but do I think there'll be in any teams post those two players no I think a lot of people will carry J Pedro just cuz he's just comfortably an unbelievable asset for for what he is and he's he'll become like brilliant eth stroke seventh for tacka that you rotate with somebody else um or be it'll be really hard to bench him as people found out last weekend um but yeah I think I think I think the only way this really changed is like I mean could and I'm could could would you would you go like Luca Dean over dunk no no no we can't be LCA Dean fixtures are there you can't be L Dean you can hide a Defender easy though can't you it's the midfielders you're almost like saying well I need to transfer I feel like that's why that's why I feel like I'd like to have M and get the fixtures and then just go CAU him out after that get bumo and be moving on because so as you say I need to find a million quid which I don't think is unreasonable well that means you need two million two transfers just to get buo in I mean and then when it becomes two I don't know the thing for in bumo for me is like I'd happily play him against Spurs away so it's only really this week you're worried about so like like is the player you're getting in instead like Minter is really good for the next two weeks but I still don't know if it's worth like in Burma 90 minutes penalty Spurs away like it's not a fix you would Target but it's also probably not one you're particularly worried about either like he probably will get a chance in that game so tough tough tough crowd for that for that argument mate this I know I know I'm speaking to the wrong people but like you I mean you're not the greatest defense out there they the other teams usually get some CH I think you've played well I think you've been a little bit unlucky with the results to be fair but there's still always the there's always a chance against your defense I think you're right I love the I love the robo Trent Sal I I love it I think it's the WR one but if I'm looking at this team and you said to me I changed Robertson Gabrielle and just have still some Arsenal defender in in place and then look at who I play off Off the Bench uh so in this one you haven't got Rico Lewis so if you swapped correct if you swapped Davis and Rico Lewis or you swapped PA Rico Lewis either way doesn't matter um then you can play Rico Lewis in this and then you've got Dunc Trent Rico I'm like really happy um and stash Gabrielle better for game week six you move Bruno to Diaz gives you a million take a half million you could have M and buo yeah though because you got three Liverpool no but you no if you changed Robertson to Gabrielle oh sorry sorry sorry yeah yeah there's Robertson with Gabrielle and there bmo's Diaz and and M's bumo um I mean why would Bruno just be bumo just because I mean like Diaz is gonna just make Bruno buo and work working out from there because Diaz is Diaz is is yes cool he's got and then you said people being convinced by points and whatever but he's he's not a 90-minute guy I gotta be honest I got I've got almost it's easy to say because I I just haven't got them and I know I'm not going to get them but I've got very little interest in Diaz and jot right now I feel like people got on them early with three pretty good fixtures when Darwin and and gapo were back late Diaz was back quite late as well so it's not the only reason that Darwin and G aren't playing but you're right they're not 90 minute men and that could get even worse over the next few weeks and like Midfield spots there's a lot of valy there they're quite precious yeah like in in this draft you're not dropping Salah or saaka or E and we're and we're already trying to figure out how we get in burm that's four spots like there's only one left and Diaz is good but I don't know if he's worth forcing in to be honest so we keep we keeping Tren and Robo because it is the best free in it Tren Robo I think most people would do that if they were wild card in this week and look we we could we could be wrong about jotter and Diaz maybe they just keep starting forever but J surely du an injury soon he usually gets injured at some point so I I I I don't think I would go there on Wild Card think I'd want to play a little bit safe which is very boring to say I realize but that is that's just how I would play it the other option just to give you more of a headache to think about is you could just drop Watkins not just down to a salanki but to someone really cheap and go three cheap forwards and then spread the money elsewhere so for example I it doesn't have to be the these players but like Xiao Pedro calv lein vissa then gives you Fernandez as a Salah and buros sacka yeah and then you still got Trent Robertson and dunk and then you put Lewis back in instead of Davis so you could even play 442 and get rid of him Burma or yeah 442 or 343 whichever when you want it no you wouldn't do that sorry because you you'd bench vissa ahead of in Burma but you could play 442 and bench both the Branford players yeah I could just take Martinez to a 4.0 everything solve well well or or Henderson yeah I would I definitely I I don't get the Henderson Martinez thing a money thing just fun yeah yeah you had too much money yeah you wouldn't because you just you'd just be happy playing Martinez this week wouldn't you I think yeah Watkins could be Kai yes saves a million gets him in place gets a little bit more yeah again what we what we're really doing here is we're building a game we six Wild Card aren't ex this is this is the thing we just game W card and I'm gonna have five transfers and everyone's going to make it make the team that I've got and I'm like well now I've got to burn [ __ ] transfers because I don't need to do anything but perfect but but you'll have five transfers and you'll have my wild card but what I'm saying is I will go into this game week without E I will go into this game week without J Pedro I'm going to go into this week with without Bruno away at Southampton which is the good fixure I'm going to go without M I'm going away with it at Trent and I and there yeah well you're all right you're fine um but I got but I got mland that pretty nice yeah yeah yeah so so in order for me you know for me I've banked on I'll have both of them but I've got loads of holes of stuff where I've made other decisions that have not worked out at all um you're still your team in gameweek four even if you protect a little bit towards gameweek six would still be in a really strong position but you all in go week six as I said not only will you gain over these next two weeks but you'll be in a better position than say I would if I wild card in game week six because I have no transfers yeah no true and that brings us all the way back I think that's a good place to finish mate to be honest cuz that's brought us all the way back to the to the almost the opening remarks I like that yeah I like that so lots to be lots to think about over the next couple of weeks but you guys so Baker you were you said you know things would have to go wrong and you might click the button how do you feel about that now are you still are you still teering so fragile like my team is so unbelievably fragile it's it's because I've got because I've moved early and I moved sacka to Sala um because I had the money to do so I've got 0.4 million um but I'm already you know I'm going into it with double Newcastle attack still which is okay at wols yeah fine as long as there's no International injuries and so forth um I've got Muniz who's got home to West Ham which again is okay it could these guys could do okay but you know Gordon and moonz could outscore Pedro and as will I'll be absolutely petrified yes Isa could outscore Wat but will I be petrified yes the bits probably that I don't like is that I'm I'm playing par and Gabrielle and there's people for the same money that are playing Trent and Rico Lewis yeah and if you said north London Derby parro and Gabrielle or home to brenford home to Forest yeah you you look at it and think I could give away 20 points just on those two those two Defenders let alone I need the other stuff to go well um and I've got no real options on the bench because I've got leis Hall who hey who knows Johnson who we don't know he's going to play now because i' got Ben um and say got ra my other midfielder so I am no bench Ed my transfer 10 days to go feet up yeah I have to put my feet up delete the app and hope that by the time that the um press conferences come around that I don't need to wild card cuz if I did suddenly need to Wild card I wouldn't have got any of the gains so I'd then be in a position where I've got none of the price changes and I've not got any transfers in the bank so I would be playing a really defensive Wild Card suddenly if I needed to do it um so I'm hopeful that I don't need to um but yeah like I say it wouldn't take it wouldn't take much it wouldn't take much um orbe it obviously when you've got Gabrielle and parro in five parro's kick suddenly gets a bit better in six Suddenly It's nice having Gabrielle in place and so forth so there is a there is a world where I continually mudle through on these ones um and never quite have the optimal team and wild card a little bit later than some others but I think every week from now I'm going to be going into it going it's probably wild God what about you Andy you must be in a better stable position than this um I think that yeah the team looks fine apart from having no Liverpool attack which you could say means it's not fine but that that is the only concern I could get Salah in two moves and just take a hit but given that I'm just going to Captain Haren anyway I'm just going to try and get away with it for one more week and just hope for the best and then my plan in game week five will be to use my two transfer SK saler and Captain him so it' be the original plan was to get rid of harand to do it U and go for like a Watkins or a Salan and then do sacka to Salah and just get rid of both the players in the City Arsenal fixture but given how well he's done and it's a home game it'll probably be Fernandez and sacka in game week five to Mina and Salah and I've got the money I got like 1.1 million spare to do that so I'm not going to get priced out um and yeah like obviously if I tinkered with a wild card for the next week it might look a bit different but the the Wild Card draft I put together with Haren and Salah the differences are basically I'd put in Robertson instead of Trent like you don't want a wild card to get rid of Trent so that doesn't feel great it would be instead of Rogers and Fernandez it's Minter and Salah which is obviously nice and then to bench and burmar i' play dunk and so essentially it's EAC to dunk so Robertson dunk Minter and Salah and right now I've got isach Trent Fernandez and Rogers like it just doesn't that doesn't scream wild card to me um and I can have Trent and Salah next week and then I can wild card in gameweek six and put whoever I want in the only thing I would say is I've looked a little bit at gameweek six wild cart like again chatting from Luke earlier he's looked into it even more than me and like there is a chance that I just still stick with Robertson and Trent in game week six because they're just so attacking and if I go without Salah I'll have the money to do that so actually the team in six might not look variously different I think the Arsenal players are the key ones like it's it's a bit it's difficult to have three Arsenal players in Wild Card 4 you'll definitely want them in game week six and it might even be that I go to reyer possibly but I'm not sure I'd want to put ryer in right now I mean you could like yes it's two bad fixtures but after that he's just in your team to your wild card again so it's not wouldn't be the worst Choice it just doesn't feel great to put someone in with back toback away games yeah so yeah short short answer I'm probably not wild card I'm just going to go about Salah J and Diaz for one more week and pray basically I think I think the rest of the team looks great so I'm happy enough of it cool it's the rightful position that that not wild carding should pray I think that's just I think that's a bit that everyone sort of like loses in the sort of emotion every season they forget it like I think I saw Johnny did a poll um and there was you know a couple of thousand people on it um and 25% of them said they're wild carding this week so if you ain't wild carding the get green arrow but you get a green arrow this week like and you're not wild carding you've done bloody well like there are sometimes where you just got a l me okay I hope for the best you can't win every week 100% got a couple of quick questions just from Discord just to just to sort of round it off if we have covered it then then cool um just a question to you Andy with the with the new thing about being able to roll transfers through has that affected the way you've planned your sort of wild card strategy at all uh no but how burnt I got for game week one with picks like Quanza and that will make me go a bit safer on wild card because I do think it's a it's a big Advantage if you can roll a few transfers even just three not even talking four or five like three leaves you very fle think how many times in the past you've had two and you've talked about well I just do a mini wild card for a minus four like three is quite nice because sometimes you need that third one to to shift funds from you I mean you might you might want to do two moves to get salary in for Harlem but you need to shift Trend just to get the money so I don't think it has changed I don't know we kind of discussed earlier maybe if I had three transfers right now possibly I'd be pushed into it a bit more because I know I've got the flexibility later but I don't think it's massively changed to be honest but I will play a bit safer probably next when I walk up cool you've already leaned into how much longer you're holding the faith in Bruno I guess obviously just Southampton and then and then look to move him on in five probably yeah I still think he's I don't think he's a terrible pick right people like to write players off so quickly especially at the start of the Season like he's just not he's always going to play you don't have to worry about him but it is annoying when there's so many players cheaper that are doing well um and then you always feel like he's the one that's restricting you Cashwise and he's also the type of player that people will get frustrated with very quickly and will go down and price more like he probably will be 8.3 by the time we get to the next deadline blanks again against Southampton he's going down again so I think he's fine if you if you can with withstand the the price drops but I don't think I would include him on wild card unless I was going super cheap up front cool yeah I mean If he if he did blank at that Southampton game i' me Jesus that'd be final straw for a lot of people yeah that'd be like Reas yeah it be it'd be a point two loss in a week yeah easy um I think we've touched on Liverpool mainly just we we're all kind of in agreement that two Liverpool Defenders are better than two Liverpool attackers because we been asked about whether who's the best second Liverpool attacker in your opinion would it be Diaz jot or would you even consider s um s saas like he's probably fine for his price but I just think when you start looking at other Midfield options from other teams then you got to sacrifice a spot for him and I just it's a bit like rice and rodri they will score a bunch of points this year but do I really want to put one of them in instead of one of the many other great midfielders probably not um I guess if I was going now I'd probably still go jot because he's playing number nine but there is part of me that thinks long-term Diaz minutes might be slightly better but it's just a gut feeling more than anything um but yeah I mean we we've talked about so many midfielders in this in this pod and it just feels difficult to fit them in now I think there's so many good options that's all right we've said we've said already Baker's got about 15 in his team already after suay I mean there some I me we haven't talk about madai I still actually like for the next four weeks like I think madai at 6 and a half is unb if I was going to punt on someone like Bruno for example in that in that let's take a B I like I like his fixtures but again would you would you do it so the same price as sasl if you off be mad or or S I'd go mad um but I probably would too I think but I'm not sure I'd do either or any most like if I couldn't afford Palmer I think I'd be more tempted maybe to look at something like him um but yeah no not me uh well there's a questions here saying the best four five Defender is who would you who could you trust as a four five Defender as your third playing Defender third playing third playing yeah others are 4.0 apparently I I mean it probably would be someone like cono or Pal Torres I think like off top I'd have to go and research a bit more there there's may be someone better but I just they got like one two four home games in the next six Everton malls United Bournemouth the two away games which and for him he's going to play um like around Champions League we'll see how they cope might not be great and like you said earlier they haven't kept a huge amount of clean sheets there is worry that like he's not exciting but he's going to play yeah so if you if you need someone that's safe maybe someone like him possibly possibly Robinson I just don't I don't really rate ful and defense that much and I know he's got two assists last two games but that's going to slow down eventually and they ain't going to get clean sheets I don't think not many fix still good though like f fixes are still good they they're all I think they're all right like West Ham and Newcastle I could see both of those teams scoring then it's an away game then it's City away then it's Villa at home is tough then it's another away game against Everton I think I think their fixtures are worse than they look I don't mind the away games apart from obviously City yeah you don't expect the clean though you're just thinking he's so attacking leave Davis and Robinson's the same deal is is that they're so attacking and so integral to the attack that there's there's a really good chance that they score goals they involved um but playing them every week is is difficult you ideally want tool them I do think they're great options if you've got Rico Lewis like having one of those two because if they because they could even if they have got a bad fixture and they come in for Rico they can still Jam a 10-pointer you know D has got seven points when they conceded um yeah and Robinson got four you know is they can still Jam something yeah cool I think we're good plenty to think about see Sunday yeah we're back on Sunday so we are speaking to John McKenzie and we need to give him something to talk about so we'll be working on that in the next few days and um as always Andy thank you very much for coming on been a really really good chat if you haven't done so already uh please make sure you drop a like on the video and if you want to see more from us hit subscribe if you're not subscribed to Andy go over to let's talk FPL and drop him a follow any last words mate are you're all good all good cool man right thanks guys see you later [Music] a [Music],16072,three game weeks in and were now into the first international break some people have absolutely smashed it whether you had harland whether you had salah and especially if you have both now we got to start looking at the wild card windows and i think that my team needs a little bit of tlc so ive got baker and weve got a very special guest to come and help me with it right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my name is adam and as always joined by baker afternoon mate how you doing im good international break pressure is off couple of weeks fpl cant hurt you i feel like its weird the very first couple of days is weird as well with no football whatsoever it feels like everyone just goes into this weird lull like were going to be talking about wild cards today but everyone was like the first couple of days it was like wild card wild card and then like its wednesday and everyones like ah well just need to calm down a little bit now and you see that in like the prices more than anything right so the prices changed sunday monday and and now its next to nothing its just those those bits and bobs going down but international break so we have to get a guest on and for anyone thats watching you can already see so weve got andy mir lets talk lets talk fpl how you doing andy right doing good thanks very impressed you nailed that intro first time i did a i did a video with luke earlier and i messed it up first time even though ive done my intro like a million times so yes well if anybody watched the recording of the intro at the start that was like take number 10 like that but thats thats just the way thats just the way it goes sometimes im not im not a pro like you andy i know you said you had to redo one but normally your stuffs one take isnt it well the finish bits one take like if i do three minutes for a five minute section i mess it up i start again from the beginning but not everything is done first time thats for sure okay it looks very good because you do navigate around the screen and stuff as youre going so is h is very good but so im here to talk about wild cards you guys can talk about whatever you want to be honest and i need probably some helpers to make sure that i dont go in wrong direction make sure im not making mistakes something im very good at is making mistakes in fpl so i could could lean on you guys so you pressed it the button is pressed so i should have done it on sunday because i missed a bunch of price changes but i caught one change on monday where i didnt lose out on gordon going down and i gained on seeno going up that was more a placeholder for now lets see if he goes up another 01 and im im glad i kept hold of harand im keeping harland until such time as i may or may not take him out because hes gone up another point one so ive banked that banked that for now thats where i am thats the thing in its double pain its like one youve got if you if you take him out its like youve got no harland and then secondly its like ive also lost some money and got to get it back so hard to take him out now as well isnt it like back toback hatt tricks you gotta be brave to wild card and remove him well thats what i thought about wild card 3 we dont need to go into gw three in too much detail but i think i would have taken harand out and i would have missed that and that would have been an absolute killer and i think the more hat tricks he scores the tougher it gets already dont it you got like i said you got to be brave to do that so im be interested to see if youre gonna do it well see well see just when you when you only make one or two transfers youve got parameters is you so when you press the big button like you can do so much that you cant help but well if i take out the person that costs the most how much extra do i get and it is a lot and these teams these teams are doing well that have just got salah what its not like teams that have just got salah are like my god season over its very different with being able to carry the transfers through as well because it like i was speaking to a couple of other mates of mine who i do this mini league from an old work thing and mate m messaged me and said and hes probably listening back to this and he said you dont need to wild card and i was like well but he said youve got transfers i was like but im still going to have those transfers so they still exist so for me its a change up of the team but when when fixers move around in six or even eight and 12 im im still ready im still can be ready i can set up the team in a way that makes it easy to switch from liverpool to arsenal for example grab a grab bumo and get him for the fixtures even potentially double up i can set up because if you get boomo on wild card then you can use a transfer to get whis and you can if you start with sacka then you dont have to bring him in six and if you start with hav you dont have to bring him in six and little things like that you can make work and by the time i come to game week six ill have four transfers so im just i dont feel like its i dont feel like its a big thing i as i said on sunday i think psychologically i was hit with the 59 pointer and thats hit me and you ill always play the old my team my emotion type vibes so its just i felt like it was a good time to try and consolidate the position and just get back into a position of strength after i felt like it just dropped away a touch i think i think the the new rules around banking transfers is quite nice because i dont think anyone knows exactly what the best way is to play it like again not to keep going back to the conversation with luke but i was saying like if this was last shot i know exactly what im doing in five because theres no way im going to burn a transfer before a wild card its so obvious but now the thinking is well maybe i just roll and i hope i get away with it and then ive got transfers coming out the back of it so like if i look at my team now i cant wild card and ive got no transfers banked so whatever i do on wild card would have to stick for a while but youre in a better position that you can go all in on liverpool maybe less so on arsenal knowing that you can easily get there and because youre wild carding the hope would be as long as you go for some safe picks that outside of injuries youre going to be youre not going to be messing with quanza and inu that some of us had to early on so i quite like the idea of going from a not a position of strength in terms of maybe the points but the transfers youve got i think could be handy i definitely lean into it more i think anybody thats wild card in this week with free transfers is in a good position orbe i think there is it does tempt you to take more planned things that you might do they might do and might do i will i would just say from scar issue that i have is the wild card in game week five last year and i think i had something like nine injuries in five weeks ouch because hamstrings just go after first international breaks its just it was for people cant remember its just everyones hamstring disappeared after once they started coming back and started playing european football and start playing league and it that things does happen so i do think although its interesting that people are like ive got these fre transfers and ill do this and ill do all these punts and so forth but youre going to be coming up against wild cards and except i learned from last year i wild carded in five im then having to use my transfers to concentrate on injuries and most people wild carded between eight and 10 and they had 15 fresh and so id think about some of those things and be like maybe i just pick a good pick so i think some interesting ones to for us to talk about today like boos are interesting one ways fixtures are not so good for the next couple of games but then get better and do you just think well ill concentrate my transfer somewhere else because theres other position where if you if you just have like a strong team so you have like nine unbelievable players and then two that havent got the greatest games but you kept your free transfers back then when everyone world carded you still didnt need they were world carding into the team so almost if you put the wild card six team in for the wild card 4 then potentially i think everyone said well what ill use is ill use my game week six to use all those transfers to keep up with them but why not almost let them play their hand keep your free transfers because most of the wild card sixers a lot of them havent got them in hand ive got no transfers in hand and i will if i world carded in game week six id almost definitely have no transfers in same exactly 100 because i want salah next week and itll take me ill have two transfers next week i want salah its going to cost me two transfers so ill be exactly the same so what you could do adam is like match what im going to wild card in game week six youre probably still going to have a better team than me in game week four and five but then when i wild card youve got a similar team but youve still got those fre free transfers so rather than almost like guaranteeing that youre going to use them theres an inter we you dont plan much in i would that i dont think i would like got three transfers theres no way im wild carding with three book transfers like that would just be nuts and like we can get into individual players in a minute certain players i might be interested in saving one for like instead of having sacka for spurs away city away maybe you start with palmer and then come down but im not i wouldnt like i dont know start on a 45m defender then ive prebooked in two weeks its just the chances of that coming off maybe rico lewis can do it right but most of the time that coming off is not going to be worth it i dont think and so for the most for the most part i dont think you probably play it too differently youre just in a stronger position afterwards than you would have been in previous seasons cool well thanks for the pod guys thats much no but if you didnt do you think you would change what youd do if you only had one free transfer i think i would probably be i think i would probably be i think i would like to be a little bit more aggressive with the wild card i think thats how i feel i want to play it and i know that goes against what you guys have just said but its interesting because weve got weve got weve had all the information now from preseason come through to the end of the transfer deadline and we know where the settled teams are now we are going to have a little bit of a hiccup when europe starts and we still dont know what thats going to look like because it looks like teams are playing tough games and then easier games and tough games and easier games and those for like pot two pot threes like a villa for example theyre going to have pretty evenly matched games throughout and then just tough games so i kind i do want to book a couple of transfers in because i think i think i can get away with it i think last year felt unusual that you got so many you specifically but generally there were so many injuries i know theres a few nigles around but last year there was just an inordinate amount of injuries so i dont think i would hope that doesnt repeat and i dont i dont want to hang my hat on it repeating in the absence the gain advantage it might be why people my managers have been tentative around some of these players that have come back to be fair there might be learns that we dont understand in the sports science world that the reason why people are being tentative with say watkins is 60 minutes so far and foden and everybody else is that theyre all like i saw what happened last season and im going to try and protect against it now by not overexerting them in the first few weeks so the protection period might have already happened but if it happens and you cant plan for injuries but if injuries definitely happen its and dont get you will keep getting one transfer a week its not like you got these free and then you dont get any more like is if you make this one so lets out well theres ab theres absolutely no reason theres absolutely no way im going to wild card into a team that needs a transfer next week thats like a given so ive got four transfers in gw six as far as im concerned ive got four transfers in gw six depend well that still also depends on injuries like its its you can never guarantee these things that those were the case but you should have you should have those many transfers but i id also i would like to think i could set up the team that could handle a couple of injuries a squad i should say that could handle a couple of injuries as well so if i do get a niggle look ive carried salanki for the last three weeks so its not i dont feel like its been a huge problem carrying salanki for those for that for that period it hasnt like last week wasnt great two weeks ago it didnt affect my team whatsoever so there are there are there are still ways you can build your squad there are enablers in there that have good fixtures so all you have to do is look at one person thats going to be in a lot of wild card teams i think is going to be leaf davis and i think you can play him in any week and i wouldnt maybe choose to play him in any week but i think if you can play him then fine like absolutely fine couple of way games one of them is against southampton four and five fine others that people are looking at well southampton ones arent great but like brightons good for the next couple and then you want to bench him anyway villas good so if youre look on morgan rogers for example then seems fine no problem the only thing youre going to stick is like a four million defender in i think and as long as you get one that plays i dont think its a big deal i wouldnt be particularly worried about injuries any more than normal i know you got burnt last year like nine is mad like in five weeks but that doesnt tend to happen also i feel like a lot of the players that will be in our wild card teams like in game week four a lot of those players dont have like sacka harland har maybe not quite so much right but salah that theyre not super injury prone players in bermo do what so i think youll probably be okay and youve already got three so like one or two punts is probably its probably fine stuff can happen right thats thats always going to be the case but i dont think it would massively put me off i dont think i the only other thing like maybe a slight concern is even though the transer shut i still feel like theres stuff to learn because some of those transfers went in quite late and so you dont know how its going to affect the team even like salanki we only seen him for one game so far and i we all we all know hes going to start but will he always playing 90 minutes whos gonna id love to know whos taking penalties between him and son as well because that could have a big effect on how important sank is i still feel like theres information to learn and maybe holding back a future answers so that could be could be handy and if you wild card him now would you have holland and salah i think i probably would but that is its definitely a reaction to what happened last game week because when i was putting wild card drafts together before gw 3 for like so before game week 3 happened but thinking about gw three and four i only had salah and when i started looking at gw six it was only harland and so the fact that i would now wild card with both that is a massive reaction and i still think long term one or the other is probably better because of the rest of the squad you get but that will only come true if they stop scoring hatt tricks or i know salah didnt score a hattrick but points wise its the same amount right what if that stops and will it happen probably right that weve seen that in previous years players dont just continue bang two three goals every single week even harland right so i feel like long term but this week just its a annoying position i think because the fixtures in front of liverpool i dont know how you cant go for salah but then youve got a guy thats just called backtoback hattricks that now has brenford at home he has fulham at home in seven he has southampton at home in nine so how can you not have him either so thats where im at so i feel like in game week six i might talk myself go salah because ill have missed forest at home bournemouth at home but right now i think its a struggle to go without both is where im at and with the amount of transfers youve got you have got ways to spread the funds later potentially a bit easier than i would for example if i was wild card in this week that does mean that youre essentially sacrificing son saaka son saaka pala as a as a trio i think you can still fit one in but definitely not more than one but then how then defense the defense looks weak at that point you get you end up with like five million defenders and four million defenders and stuff which and that is why i still think long term its not the play i think this is a difficult week to because i feel like you if youre g to go one this week you go salah right i think and that feels scary but thats not how we should play fpl but also its its natural to be worried about whats just happened and if harand goes and bangs another hattick i know someone said to me the other day like hes got seven goals from 3xg i get its a bit of over points but this is also a guy that gets tons of chances most games so if he scores another hattrick you cant look back and say well thats a bit unlucky like its possible so and thats where the thats why its it there is still i know its it feels like feels like harlem would always have that share of goal for man city it feels it although salahs done very well in his share of goals so far the other guys have also had loads of chances is diaz has had chances jot has had chances trents had chances so li had chances they theyve all had chances so i still see a world where you could have a 30 and sellah is isnt involved i dont ever see a world where theres a free at man city and hollands not probably getting a brac in that world its still feels still feels like all funnels to him i think whatever you do youve just got to be able to hold your nerve for a few weeks and stick with it like you cant wild card with just one and then in game week four or five like sorry game week five or six just then panic the other one in like you you got to remember the reasons you did it right if you go salah only and harlem banks hat well you knew that was possible right it shouldnt change going forward but and thats a long answer overall but i think i would go for both this week i think i would i just i think just the arsenal and newcastle fixes are the ones i think that are going to soften the harland train for people that are wild card in myself included definitely and just when the other the other premium opportunities or the premium options are have good fixtures so you get you could have palmer for bournemouth and west ham and then you can have sacka for leicester and southampton and then you can flip on down to son and hes got west ham and palace and there are and then you add six million around the rest of your squad when you do that or five million around the rest of your squad and you can you can dip into all the other better fixtures as well im seeing that now i feel like im seeing feel like im seeing the light on that and i also feel theres an over reliance on the premiums if you do it that way if you do it that way and you get harland and salah like if they if they dont both return significantly in a week youre staring at like a 25p pointer like thats a realistic potential week i think the other thing to maybe point out as well is weve only had three weeks like things are going to change it always happens in fpl and right now a lot of people with harand and salah or the drafts theyre building with both have got like cheap players that have done well that might not continue it might be that seeno is now a breakout 55m hes going to keep getting hes got three returns in three right maybe he goes to a return every other game is he capable of doing that possibly but im not sure people would bet that much money same with smith roow right i think hes probably a good option and he has scored already but we havent seen him properly regularly for like two three years right so its great when these cheapes are doing well but as soon as hav well that hes already doing all right but hav watkins maybe isak starts like isaks done nothing so far right well sorry hes got a goal and an assist i get that but we expected more for the fixtures they had so i think you need those eight to nine million players to start doing better than they have and for the defensive picks that are also more expensive to start coming in and once that happens like you said harand and salah dont go and score 17 points every week all of a sudden that will flip around but i honestly think thats where youve got to hold your nerve if thats the way you go youve got to wait for that to work out and just not panic when the cheapy start or continue to do well i just i just wouldnt see it happening forever do what just because its working for the first three weeks does not mean itll work for the next three etc so i agree with what youre saying about the overall squad i just dont know if id be brave enough to do it this week thats all if i can ask about two others that people look at wild card ill ask the cheap version first rico lewis but for me for me i would almost want him as a fifth defender i dont think i want to leave myself in a position where ive got to play him any higher than that maybe fourth defender and like if youre going for a saleron draft and youve got like trent and robertson maybe like a por or someone maybe that would be then okay to have him as well i dont know what i need to see before im comfortable with rico its probably another 10 games without ky walker but its looking good like luke talking about on twitter and stuff that he thinks for walker to come in like one or two things has to happen system change from what theyve been playing or jon stones to invert instead of rico lewis and then k walker to be part of a back three in possession are either those things going to happen when theyre playing so well right now possibly i think i think hes a worthwhile pump because hes so cheap ive got like ive got no interest in savio or dku or anyone like that just dont think its worth it but 46m defender for man city thats like getting into number 10 like positions is i feel like even i could be temped to buy a punt on that and i wouldnt usually feels like a golden goose isnt it the difficult the thing is as you say like you dont want any of the other man city players like theres no other real options people arent even talking about edison this year so no ones not yet not yet no ones no ones no ones going into tripling up on city because again we just dont know whats going to happen around europe etc and were still waiting for foden to come back were still waiting for rodri to come back so i think its im pretty comfortable in taking that punt weirdly i just checked my salad team and i forgot to put him in but perfect so ill have to ill have to fix that and i was going to say something else and i cannot remember so if i remember ill say it again just to cheap i just i would he would be straight in for me i wouldnt i wouldnt i would be overthinking thats what i was going to say the only other thing maybe is around the champions league is that whether he looks to use lewis moore in the champions league and then brings walker in for the premier league games you we dont know how that rotation expect the other way around though would it might be it might be the other way around it might very well be the other way around and that might be the way to keep walker from in terms of getting his minutes in there id expect it the other way around if anything especially as in theory every almost every team thats city and to play in the champions league are weaker than them so shouldnt be too tough just that extra leadership midweek all these things its just this it just works i think or at luke will always tell us that hes got specific plan so it wont be that hell just rotate for that it will be because this suits walker skill set and this suits lewiss skill set hell tell us very different in that world but hey i think i think the arsenal game is going to be the real test but unfortunately if youre wild card and four you cant wait for that if he plays that game i think hell be in on my wild c six like absolutely no question absolutely i dont think you play him in that g in that week anyway like if youve got him you dont play him in that week anyway so i dont think its not its not a huge issue no more that if he plays in such a big game then hes there locked in for the future but not for the whole season because hes a man city player what enough that id be confident to go for him fair hed be hed be in and then the other one because one of the one of the ways that you potentially afford a harland and salah draft is maybe not having trent but is trent just essential well ive got him right now on my actual team not wild card and im very glad about that and again liverpool next two fixtures it feels pretty again it feels crazy like its such a tough time to wild card and not go for the best options from those teams but on a harand salah draft its very difficult to fit them in like it just is like for me e and burma are just nob brainers so they would definitely be in youve got salah anyway so youve only got two more midfield spots like i said i would want to try and fit someone like sakur in as well or palmer and at that point trents not getting in as well so i think he is great and i would definitely have him i think if i was going for one or the other or at least id try and fit him in but i dont know if hes essential i dont know if id class him at that level and he keeps getting subbed early as well which is nice for clean sheets but it also tells you that maybe at some point in between the champions league game conor bradley might get a start possibly i dont think thats necessarily going to happen soon but i think hes good enough i dont dont think hes got any problems no problems chucking him in there like theres a drop off every right back is a drop off pretty much from trent but its not its not youre worried about its not like simas on the other side like i think conor bradleys a a step up level wise so that wouldnt stop me buying trent by the way but its in the back of my mind that maybe that could happen at some point ive got a hope that lot i dont own trent its absolutely horrific watching every game not only trent so just for anyone whos doing it and not going is horrible but and ive heard ive heard nothing but from trent owners god weve been so unlucky should be 15 20 points everyones completely ignoring the fact that theyve got three cleans in a row that had eight cleans in the whole of last season theyve conceded minus 22 xg which is good which is unbelievable but still free cleans is unbelievably lucky when youve conceded minus 22 xg theres never any balance on that theres only that is so in terms of terms of points that have been seed its probably about right he should have some attacking returns but he also shouldnt have as many clean as hes had the bit youre buying into if you get him now or the next few games is theres definitely a chance he could get a 15 20 pointer in the next two games is hes a few millimeters away from that in the last game even with being subbed off thats definitely the bit but i have people been hard done by on it mate you got 20 points i dont feel hard done by with trent i know i know hes put up the numbers to maybe get an attacking return but i think hes done just fine we just know theres the capability of doing more dont we what do you think of i dont know if youve looked at like liverpools longer term fixtures because after the two home games its then two away games wolves and palace then its chelsea at home arsenal away then even the two home games after that of brighton and villa who wed probably have down as pretty decent attacking sides but i also theres another angle which makes you look at them think theyre all right if theyre going to be this good defensively and but theyve not theyve not been tested that much so far but if theyre going to be this good defensively and we know what his attacking output is maybe those pictures arent as bad as they potentially look on paper dont what you guys think about them i dont think they i dont think youre bang on i dont think theyre that bad at all i think they are good i think that that arsenal away game is a tough game but city is at home in 13 thatll be thats not going to be a game for a clean sheet but its going to be a game for fun and the rest of them i think absolutely fine i think theyre all good fixtures i dont think theres a need so theres a lot of people that are going to be forcing theel there will be people that will be forcing themselves to go from salah to sacka in seven around there i think thats feels like a mistake i think i feel like to plan it just a hattick just goes well hard scores a hat trick and hes only like whoa well hes going to if sal scores hat tricks against forest bmer from wolves taking him out no hes not going to go anywhere no chance i dont right now i dont see me having salah on wild card and six but again if he gets back toback hat tricks like harland has the conversation might be a bit different itd be difficult probably to have we know its difficult we talked about it to have harand to have salah to have trent and to have a 10m is tough not un impossible to do it you end up with a lot of pain in other areas a lot of sacrifice in other areas can you imagine that in the previous season the previous season so equating that can you imagine last season or the season before saying im going to have four 115m pound players youd be like what the what the hell are you doing surely youve got to surely one of those has got to be an 8m a 9m like it just it just is too much money the only potential is though is that all teams are scoring were just seeing one week where only one team kept to clean so everyones scoring mhm and we have got these groups of teams that have lovely fixture runs that are quite cheap villa assets bar watkins are cheap since why people look at their defenders and look at rogers youve got brighton into this situation weve had forest and forest run gets good again in about week eight onwards it starts getting good again wolves have got an incredible run coming like three or four weeks and then everyones going to be like nor please right umuna is real cheap even bizarrely like ive looked potentially if i was wanting to go cheap on it is i dont think jamie vardy is the most horrific pick on earth if you could bench him occasionally like there is in amongst the horribleness for it he did still manage to just play 90 minutes which is its quite impressive from j mardy but youve got some biggies like bournemouth at home i think its seven is it and then forest at home in nine and even ipswitch away and you got chelsea at home west ham at home brighton at home walls at home these are all in the first half of the season i was going to say that run of six games that run of six games everton home then arsenal when you just benched bournemouth southampton forest hips which is a run of four games is about as good as you want leaf davis wha what these guys and so there are there are a load of good chief players and we havent me wax lyrical about seo but at 5 and a half but that run gets good it might be that weve said these first few weeks is like wow salah and harling have done amazing and stuff but it may be as much as we say they probably wont continue these five and a halfs they might they might and theres enough of them youre right especially cheap forwards there are a ton of options that are playing and like this burma is the penalty taker right we know that but visa just keeps scoring he did at the end of last season i believe as well hes an option vardy youve mentioned ca you said im sure like even calv lein ive ive looked at as well who what hell come in play a little bit even bowens not expensive hes definitely not expensive c just keep going d mcneil put in now weve gone too far too far too far but there is there is an array of them so you might find that if you went on wild card with both the big boys you might find there is always an option out for you and kka would be five and a half by the time he starts starting its weird because weve always like in the past as well we talking about rotating premiums and i think two years ago we were talking about rotating 8m mids and now weve evolved to rotating five and a half million players we just slowly getting cheaper maybe thats maybe thats the way maybe thats the good are that good do like if you if you just said right ive never t taken out harland sacka paul harand sacka salah and trent lets just say those four so never just theyll sit there those four players are do pretty well for the season and you always kept one of them i to be honest at least for probably the next 10 12 game weeks i also see e and burma in that same category that once theyre in youre just not messing with them unless they get injured which could happen i think a missed a few good few games last year but i honestly see them say like anyone that wild cs this week of har and salad youre keeping them for ages and youre keeping a and burma as well and then okay maybe if you start with a liverpool defender you might switch to an arsenal one but i know it always sounds good in theory right thats great you just put your team together and you just dont ever have to worry about it of course stuff will happen but in theory there are a lot of players that you could just hold on to and the transferring cheapes if youve got the spare bank transfers it could be could be the way to go team should have a look at a couple well lets start with the lets start with harand and salah well lets start no lets start with harand and salah so not these are draft draft teams theres some theres definitely some strengths in them so for those listening ive got martinez in goal just think villas fixtures for the next x week are very good and then a back three are robinson dunc and lewis and then my other defenders are porro and harwood bellis its porro plus a 4m and to say my other keeper is going to be a 4m i would pray caution on fabianski i dont think theres anything wrong with arola and plus if people pile in on him the next thing he be 39 so i wouldnt go there midfield salah e bruno rogers and bumo and then jaal pedro and harland and then ross stewart on the bench four and a half million could be whoever to be honest i think thats a way to make it work i think this one had about point six in the bank for what ive got but everyones team value is different i the player that does worry me in this one is just rogers and then the fact that ive got two players on my bench that i just dont want to play on keepers although lets just say fabianski is your reserve keeper and he drops to two and a half million does it matter you might not change him again for 30 for the rest of the season so even if he loses man he does it but the only thing with arola is like do you not think when he when he went off the other day hes like it he doesnt play 38 games it does happen its not the first time hes been subbed off all that to do stuff with it if anyones likely to potentially get injured in terms of if you offer me like bets on a first team keeper to get injured arola would probably be my first bet if i was looking at it w like the last man standing and you who do i think who do i think like first man out type things id probably bet on arola he does seem to find ways for it so i wouldnt care if fabianski drops because next time youre going to change your kit your reserve keeper is going to be youre not going to care by then maybe like its only ever change they change once isnt it if that i dont think we need to spend too much time talking about it well are you gonna tell me that you think arola is a good pick then from w cott no i think a good pick but i was going to suggest a rotation a rotation well i just think weve got a couple of gifts in that weve had a couple of keepers transfer which means that we get a couple of keepers that have already dropped that are now first choice so we we get rams out and we get johnston now if john im im not going to say ramsdale i dont think southampton is a keeper that i want in my life but on johnston the reason apparently he didnt play was to do with zy links and all those type stuff by the time the game comes around to play again we might know that jose ss not at the club and then youve got 44 ramsdale sorry 44 johnston as your backup keeper and if you go to walls as i said from 10 is it 10 crystal palace at home southampton at home fulham away bournemouth at home everton away west ham away i switch home leester away man united home tottenham away forest at home its its an unbelievable run the later wild carders i think they all going to be like ive got 44 keeper that sits there but you can save just a bit of money so if you can find a four and a half that you like then i dont mind it and i think with dunk for example weve seen so far the hes nowhere near and i cant see a world unless he scores that hes ever near the bonus because youve got pedro as a penalty taker so and youve got well backck youve got two strikers that are on the pitch youve got wingers that are tricky they get fouled a lot so if they score theyre both baseline is pretty good m has been good then youve got all action blind next to him in van heck who always trs his m bonus so hes never going to beat him and then youve got potentially k oglo and a stan all those guys its like and then their baseline for their keeper is always and has been for years now steel or bren if they keep it theyre theyre like 1819 on their baseline that im like i think i would potentially take a punt on ver buen and johnston and its like make saves like 01m or whatever than what martinez does but gives me two playing keepers two longterm options not the worlds greatest fixtures for either team in that like seven to nine bracket but if i was looking at a pair theyd probably be the pair that id look at i think only sorry i was gonna say i think and dont quote me on this it would be the same price i believe fleing and ver bren also rotate nicely but i know guys dont like fleing that much but thats like but brenford and brighton i think rotate pretty good as well so it could be another one four home games straight out the bat from the wild card with that rotation just sucks though theyre like it does of course it sucks by the way we should we should treat go is like any other player like when dunk plays terrible fixtures youre going to bring in a different 45 with your bench right but for goalkeepers theres just this psychological thing that they will go and haul in a bad fixture and its going to kill you when they when it happens but thats not how we should think about it but we do my only thing on emmy right is that since the start of last season theyve kept eight cleans a five million count ban keeper thats kept eight cleans in 41 games feels it then when you look at the cleans that hes kept so twice against arsenal once against city once against chelsea hes like such a big game player like they quite often concede against their easier fixtures know the sheffield united and everton are the only teams that then else have kept them giving them cleans so the big positive because he keeps those cleans then in big games of course he makes loads of saves so in like the eight cleans hes had hes got 16 bonus of those and in those and he gets sa points in all of them so he does have that propensity that they keep cleans but its like what were looking at is we want to pick him now because hes got those easier fixtures and youre like well one its annoying if youre paid 5m he gets a two pointer but two hes little bit less likely to get those the bonus and the saves from these ones that makes me think like is it does it look good but doesnt play out that way one of the things i think is a big positive though is anana were already starting to see that so they were pretty much the worst setpiece team in the world last season is they conceded 109 shots from set pieces 14 xg from set pieces i think 18 goals it was in the end its more than tottenham and we are horrific this season theyve only conceded four chances from set plays 14 xg from set plays and theyve played arsenal like anana is so big the i spent all summer telling every spurs fan that listen we just got to sign onano because it just fixes everything he fixes everything in set plays so if im like well yes theyve been rubbish but it could be okay its all ar and aror i would suggest thats there but is that set p is that set piece coach theyve got is he new as well because they scor the set piece i think they might theyve been working on z poli you get double benefit from that i dont mind the martinez pick to be honest i quite its just a fixes play is it one this question does relate to the goalkeeper even though its a completely different position whats with this draft whats the gw six plan to get sacker in particular or you going to go without that its a challenge to get sacker in because youre not going to want to take salah out are you not not its probably a harand sale before f at in game seven at seven justes it just makes no sense like they say this was thrown together last minute because ive been focusing primarily on no harland and more on just salah on his own so the reason i ask is because i put a team together very similar to this but it does have sacker instead of bruno fernandez because im just sick of the sight of him already and thats where like a cheap like forget the 45 rotations just a 45 would free up 05 then youve got 6 in the banks thats one and then it depends how tired you are to pedro parro just reminding myself now let me just let me remind myself how much is in the bank here let me just refresh im pretty sure its similar to the what like if you if you drop parro to another 45 and then so for me theres 11 in the bank on this one wow even better so you could just drop martinez to a 45 keep por and you still have enough money to get sacka just go direct bruno to sacka so this exact team as well you could put you could to put tren in i could just put trent in instead of robber you could just put trent in so people were looking at it and thinking you cant well you could just sw that in but do you not like do you not think okay lets lets just say you go for the 45 keeper whoever it is like at that point and then it comes down to combination thing trent and fernandez or robertson and sacka i know its not quite the same difference but when you put it like that i think it gets a lot harder to justify trent that does just that i love this is why people listen to you is that youre looking at all these youre looking at the proper players im like 45 i was about to say also 40 defender you got to go moscara because again that w youre not youre not doing a 40 for the next few weeks you dont care about it for the next few weeks so do it when the later so moso is playing every minute hes 40 hes hes your chuck in nailed on 40 defender for me definitely thats why i said earlier that trent is brilliant but hes just not an essential status for me because when you try fitting in everyone else like something has to give and i think in certain situations hes the one to give like in this case i would definitely rather have robertson and sacka than fernandez and trent and again theres 0 five left over for the fernandez trent one but i still think its worth just spending it and just getting s you like you will want sacker in gw six i feel that theres no doubt about that like odard maybe he turns things around by them but even if he does hes still not as good a sacker i just dont think you can go through leicester at home and southampton at home without him just i am 0 one short so ill be01 short point one short how tired are you to parro thats true like parro could be parro could be different probably could be different so then that then that just makes the money happen so i the team i built is got a 45 fleen it could be anyone else ive got minter instead of rogers but to fund that ive got mikeno instead of par so thats the 0 one saving there and rico lewis has gone up i didnt have him in my team so i know everton have been terrible so far but the fixtures arent that bad and hes like a fifth defender i dont know you still got to just keep playing i think youre right you still got keep playing the fixtures absolutely but i think sack is a big consideration for me for sure well then lets have a look at this it doesnt have it doesnt have earling so this is just mo well i say just mo like he has some friends but this ones got 45 well got henderson and martinez together this is just throwing money around cuz you got so much you in the bank as well just for banter ridicul so the defense is dunk trent and robo and then porro and leaf davis on the bench and then ive got e sacka bruno salah and m just because that ipswitch have conceded down that flank every single game and that and theyve conceded from the right midfielder or the right forward every single game theyve theyve had returns so being termism like i am m in there and then xiao pedro watkins and then and then ross stewart again so i know i know you dont like the watkins well i dont know whether you dont like the watkins because you gave me a little comment on twitter last night i dont know what you were trying to what you were trying to say on twitter i was just jabbing you on twitter because it was like its the same old thing that everyone will always use is the is the a person pulls out of an international break like fixes fake injury its a fake injuries thats a positive for my team and its like but hes not been playing like hes not been playing so if you want him in your team youre going to be like well what im going to do now is be like theres no objectivity whatsoever its just my subjective is this fits my budget so what i will do is just say thats going to be okay whereas im like hey listen for it to be okay it could be but lets not pretend its okay its definitely its never going to be good the best news was that he went away with england he played 90 minutes england that was thats thats the only positive that could happen in terms of watkins in the international break everything else is bad like its its its always its not even bad it creates more questions and we will get less answers because ems never going to say by the way he going to play 60 minutes again this week im going to take him off for 30 minutes he might does is emory the got i dont know what shes press as normally is he guy hes been saying it every week so far is he well not hes going to play 60 minutes but if hes asked whether s ready is he gonna say yes or no im im definitely paraphrasing i cant remember exactly what he said but im pretty sure he said before the third game that now after the first two games his minutes will be better and they were the worst of the first three games so like international break injuries that theyre usually rubbish and i look at the three that england have had like cole palmer im sure hes absolutely fine phil foden theres definitely something wrong there because hes been ill right so even if its not major maybe there is reason theyve kept him behind watkins could be good if its just a small thing that he needs recovery time rather than playing time but youre not going to get that info like you said but it would worry the watkins one worries me the most out of the three because he hasnt played that much theres something theres something there now would it put me off buying him probably not if we know him he says hes fine because the fixures are so good but i am im not as confident about buying watkins right now as i would have been if youd asked me in preseason what my gw four wild card team was going to look like and it would have definitely had watkins i think everyone was talking about him right isaach to watkins easy move all of a sudden it just doesnt look as good because hes hes just not getting the minutes duran keeps scoring its not helping and not that hes going to get replaced right but it just means you can make those substitutions with the confidence that the guy coming on is playing all right and also we dont know how champions league is going to affect viller like im not sure if watkins is going to be a 90 minute man every week around champions league so i my thinking is with watkins is his minutes will go up from where theyve been because its very difficult for them not to but they may come down from where they were last year is what my thinking is right now but i agree that the england thing is probably with him more of a worry than like if i own cole palman i would not be worried whatsoever but watkins id be a little bit i would still have him though do if i was in this draft and you ask me who im going to put in there i still would i would have watkin but if i knew that he was training on the week leading up because if hes not training you would ob wouldnt bother but if you knew he was training would i think he loses his place no do i think the worst case situation is he comes off 65 second minutes yes do i think the best cas situation is hes got amazing pictur he plays united yes so therefore is is i would definitely he would definitely be in my team but i would still also have that worry like even more even stupid stuff like youve got the vice captain on this i know you wouldnt know but ill be like not doing that like he suddenly i dont think he could possibly be a captain option for example in games and he sits here as like the still sits here as a second most expensive striker so he is just hes there if emry says no hes not ready he becomes whoever he needs to be i dont i dont feel across the midfield like theres anybody that i would i would probably just come down in price on him and that would make getting to bumo easier well and you need to have a conversation about bruno fernandez youre the man united fan here ill ill ask the question first i would ask you is do you think if you hadnt had bruno fernandez for game weeks one to three you would have him in your gw four wild card no probably not because a bit like harlem right like as much as we shouldnt be affected by points scored we are like we all are and like and also i know it happens all the time where man united fans over at massively after games even i had a slight dig at ten hog afterwards on twitter about the exx players and stuff but they are not good still i dont think and its like okay wellar is coming in so that would be good garro is starting out to that would be good holand might be back but its all miks and ifs and i dont know i just southampton always fine im im happy to have him this week i think thats fine but i dont think crystal palace away is gonna be that easy i think your boys wont be easy like if youre on it and youre pressing as high and theres no like martinez was just he had no one to pass to half the time its not that he cant do it he just didnt have anyone to pass it and spurs will not let that up viller away is not that easy either the fixures after that get pretty good i dont know i part of its a man united thing but i just find it very frustrating with him when hes not theres certain players when they dont return like e for example first two games didnt care keeping him great option going forward fernandez is just you always want to get rid of him because hes that little bit more expensive so hes got to deliver a bit more so there is a bit of bias there but id find it hes not in my gw six plans put it that way not right now and i know i know adam will beat himself up if he doesnt have fernandez having had in for three weeks and then he hammers it versus sampton it will make him furious i can say i be angry i will be angry be real angry i feel like youve got i feel like you got to have him i you trans later game six like without shadow but i just dont i cant see a world where i choose to make a transfer to bring him in so i feel like i need to have him in now and then when i get to game week nine ive got the ive got him sorry game week eight game week eight for the brenford game ive ive got him and hes in place and as you say hopefully like hope dropped in price another half million theres that but hopefully like hopefully from an fpl perspective united are up to speed and theyre theyre starting to generate some proper chances and he invariably has to be involved like it has to be well it has to be either him or gacho thats creating for united i cant see it coming from anywhere else i i wouldnt i dont know like i dont think hes a bad pick i just dont and again one of those chances goes in against fulham and all of a sudden the narrative changes while he was a bit unlucky against brighton with the xery knee and then okay well he played liverpool that can happen and the narrative is a bit different its just what but then everythings different if players score points right so i dont know i like ive just thats what ive been doing in the background ive been putting that team into the fpl page just to see how the money goes and its quite a lot of like you could have him burma in that spot ready to go and then suddenly you got like over two million to spend elsewhere maybe then stewart goes up to someone else you dont have to playing bermo this week but where but stuart goes well stuart goes up to the only player thats i would want around 6m is wher and hes got the same problem as in burma with the fixture so i just dont know where that money would go unless it went into defense or unless watkins comes down but then the only way watkins comes down and then bruno comes down and i go up somewhere else because then i can take him up rather than down or i can take min up rather than down for example is to is if sank is fit but then theres its its arsenal so the problem the thing with salanki is beyond that like fixtures for spurs are good so brenford united brighton west ham palace villa like thats thats a decent run of fixtures and theres going to be a lot of people in gw six looking at that and going well thats that ill get salanki and thanks and like even i feel like i cant get in on arsenal now because of the fixtures for the next two games theres little things that i just cant quite get my head straight on how much money did you say you got in the bank for this half a million so if you were even if you were keeping bruno but you wanted mente to go to bumo you need one and a half million so million well again theres also parro to look at whoever i do i do think the brighton triple up as in dunk m i just just looked on the old its a bit fierce hub ticker and went i just i just went started at week six and just put a random week in which was 24 i put it to and brighton were the bottom out of all 20 teams as a fix around thats bottom like so very quick like so im like do i see dunc and m on any game week six wild cards like none any theyre now and theyre good fixtures thats why a lot of people had them on gameing one and why theyre good then but do i think therell be in any teams post those two players no i think a lot of people will carry j pedro just cuz hes just comfortably an unbelievable asset for what he is and hes hell become like brilliant eth stroke seventh for tacka that you rotate with somebody else or be itll be hard to bench him as people found out last weekend but i think i think i think the only way this changed is like could and im could would you would you go like luca dean over dunk no we cant be lca dean fixtures are there you cant be l dean you can hide a defender easy though cant you its the midfielders youre almost like saying well i need to transfer i feel like thats why thats why i feel like id like to have m and get the fixtures and then just go cau him out after that get bumo and be moving on because so as you say i need to find a million quid which i dont think is unreasonable well that means you need two million two transfers just to get buo in and then when it becomes two i dont know the thing for in bumo for me is like id happily play him against spurs away so its only this week youre worried about so like is the player youre getting in instead like minter is good for the next two weeks but i still dont know if its worth like in burma 90 minutes penalty spurs away like its not a fix you would target but its also probably not one youre particularly worried about either like he probably will get a chance in that game so tough crowd for that for that argument mate this i know i know im speaking to the wrong people but like you youre not the greatest defense out there they the other teams usually get some ch i think youve played well i think youve been a little bit unlucky with the results to be fair but theres still always the theres always a chance against your defense i think youre right i love the i love the robo trent sal i love it i think its the wr one but if im looking at this team and you said to me i changed robertson gabrielle and just have still some arsenal defender in place and then look at who i play off the bench so in this one you havent got rico lewis so if you swapped correct if you swapped davis and rico lewis or you swapped pa rico lewis either way doesnt matter then you can play rico lewis in this and then youve got dunc trent rico im like happy and stash gabrielle better for game week six you move bruno to diaz gives you a million take a half million you could have m and buo though because you got three liverpool no but you no if you changed robertson to gabrielle sorry theres robertson with gabrielle and there bmos diaz and ms bumo why would bruno just be bumo just because like diaz is gonna just make bruno buo and work working out from there because diaz is diaz is yes cool hes got and then you said people being convinced by points and whatever but hes hes not a 90minute guy i gotta be honest i got ive got almost its easy to say because i just havent got them and i know im not going to get them but ive got very little interest in diaz and jot right now i feel like people got on them early with three pretty good fixtures when darwin and gapo were back late diaz was back quite late as well so its not the only reason that darwin and g arent playing but youre right theyre not 90 minute men and that could get even worse over the next few weeks and like midfield spots theres a lot of valy there theyre quite precious like in this draft youre not dropping salah or saaka or e and were and were already trying to figure out how we get in burm thats four spots like theres only one left and diaz is good but i dont know if hes worth forcing in to be honest so we keep we keeping tren and robo because it is the best free in it tren robo i think most people would do that if they were wild card in this week and look we could we could be wrong about jotter and diaz maybe they just keep starting forever but j surely du an injury soon he usually gets injured at some point so i dont think i would go there on wild card think id want to play a little bit safe which is very boring to say i realize but that is thats just how i would play it the other option just to give you more of a headache to think about is you could just drop watkins not just down to a salanki but to someone cheap and go three cheap forwards and then spread the money elsewhere so for example i it doesnt have to be the these players but like xiao pedro calv lein vissa then gives you fernandez as a salah and buros sacka and then you still got trent robertson and dunk and then you put lewis back in instead of davis so you could even play 442 and get rid of him burma or 442 or 343 whichever when you want it no you wouldnt do that sorry because youd bench vissa ahead of in burma but you could play 442 and bench both the branford players i could just take martinez to a 40 everything solve well or henderson i would i definitely i dont get the henderson martinez thing a money thing just fun you had too much money you wouldnt because you just youd just be happy playing martinez this week wouldnt you i think watkins could be kai yes saves a million gets him in place gets a little bit more again what we what were doing here is were building a game we six wild card arent ex this is this is the thing we just game w card and im gonna have five transfers and everyones going to make it make the team that ive got and im like well now ive got to burn transfers because i dont need to do anything but perfect but youll have five transfers and youll have my wild card but what im saying is i will go into this game week without e i will go into this game week without j pedro im going to go into this week with without bruno away at southampton which is the good fixure im going to go without m im going away with it at trent and i and there well youre all right youre fine but i got but i got mland that pretty nice so in order for me for me ive banked on ill have both of them but ive got loads of holes of stuff where ive made other decisions that have not worked out at all youre still your team in gw four even if you protect a little bit towards gw six would still be in a strong position but you all in go week six as i said not only will you gain over these next two weeks but youll be in a better position than say i would if i wild card in game week six because i have no transfers no true and that brings us all the way back i think thats a good place to finish mate to be honest cuz thats brought us all the way back to the to the almost the opening remarks i like that i like that so lots to be lots to think about over the next couple of weeks but you guys so baker you were you said things would have to go wrong and you might click the button how do you feel about that now are you still are you still teering so fragile like my team is so unbelievably fragile its its because ive got because ive moved early and i moved sacka to sala because i had the money to do so ive got 04m but im already im going into it with double newcastle attack still which is okay at wols fine as long as theres no international injuries and so forth ive got muniz whos got home to west ham which again is okay it could these guys could do okay gordon and moonz could outscore pedro and as will ill be absolutely petrified yes isa could outscore wat but will i be petrified yes the bits probably that i dont like is that im im playing par and gabrielle and theres people for the same money that are playing trent and rico lewis and if you said north london derby parro and gabrielle or home to brenford home to forest you look at it and think i could give away 20 points just on those two those two defenders let alone i need the other stuff to go well and ive got no real options on the bench because ive got leis hall who hey who knows johnson who we dont know hes going to play now because i got ben and say got ra my other midfielder so i am no bench ed my transfer 10 days to go feet up i have to put my feet up delete the app and hope that by the time that the press conferences come around that i dont need to wild card cuz if i did suddenly need to wild card i wouldnt have got any of the gains so id then be in a position where ive got none of the price changes and ive not got any transfers in the bank so i would be playing a defensive wild card suddenly if i needed to do it so im hopeful that i dont need to but like i say it wouldnt take it wouldnt take much it wouldnt take much orbe it when youve got gabrielle and parro in five parros kick suddenly gets a bit better in six suddenly its nice having gabrielle in place and so forth so there is a there is a world where i continually mudle through on these ones and never quite have the optimal team and wild card a little bit later than some others but i think every week from now im going to be going into it going its probably wild god what about you andy you must be in a better stable position than this i think that the team looks fine apart from having no liverpool attack which you could say means its not fine but that is the only concern i could get salah in two moves and just take a hit but given that im just going to captain haren anyway im just going to try and get away with it for one more week and just hope for the best and then my plan in game week five will be to use my two transfer sk saler and captain him so it be the original plan was to get rid of harand to do it u and go for like a watkins or a salan and then do sacka to salah and just get rid of both the players in the city arsenal fixture but given how well hes done and its a home game itll probably be fernandez and sacka in game week five to mina and salah and ive got the money i got like 11m spare to do that so im not going to get priced out and like if i tinkered with a wild card for the next week it might look a bit different but the wild card draft i put together with haren and salah the differences are id put in robertson instead of trent like you dont want a wild card to get rid of trent so that doesnt feel great it would be instead of rogers and fernandez its minter and salah which is nice and then to bench and burmar i play dunk and so essentially its eac to dunk so robertson dunk minter and salah and right now ive got isach trent fernandez and rogers like it just doesnt that doesnt scream wild card to me and i can have trent and salah next week and then i can wild card in gw six and put whoever i want in the only thing i would say is ive looked a little bit at gw six wild cart like again chatting from luke earlier hes looked into it even more than me and like there is a chance that i just still stick with robertson and trent in game week six because theyre just so attacking and if i go without salah ill have the money to do that so the team in six might not look variously different i think the arsenal players are the key ones like its its a bit its difficult to have three arsenal players in wild card 4 youll definitely want them in game week six and it might even be that i go to reyer possibly but im not sure id want to put ryer in right now you could like yes its two bad fixtures but after that hes just in your team to your wild card again so its not wouldnt be the worst choice it just doesnt feel great to put someone in with back toback away games so short answer im probably not wild card im just going to go about salah j and diaz for one more week and pray i think i think the rest of the team looks great so im happy enough of it cool its the rightful position that not wild carding should pray i think thats just i think thats a bit that everyone like loses in the emotion every season they forget it like i think i saw johnny did a poll and there was a couple of thousand people on it and 25 of them said theyre wild carding this week so if you aint wild carding the get green arrow but you get a green arrow this week like and youre not wild carding youve done bloody well like there are sometimes where you just got a l me okay i hope for the best you cant win every week 100 got a couple of quick questions just from discord just to just to round it off if we have covered it then cool just a question to you andy with the with the new thing about being able to roll transfers through has that affected the way youve planned your wild card strategy at all no but how burnt i got for game week one with picks like quanza and that will make me go a bit safer on wild card because i do think its a its a big advantage if you can roll a few transfers even just three not even talking four or five like three leaves you very fle think how many times in the past youve had two and youve talked about well i just do a mini wild card for a minus four like three is quite nice because sometimes you need that third one to shift funds from you you might you might want to do two moves to get salary in for harlem but you need to shift trend just to get the money so i dont think it has changed i dont know we discussed earlier maybe if i had three transfers right now possibly id be pushed into it a bit more because i know ive got the flexibility later but i dont think its massively changed to be honest but i will play a bit safer probably next when i walk up cool youve already leaned into how much longer youre holding the faith in bruno just southampton and then and then look to move him on in five probably i still think hes i dont think hes a terrible pick right people like to write players off so quickly especially at the start of the season like hes just not hes always going to play you dont have to worry about him but it is annoying when theres so many players cheaper that are doing well and then you always feel like hes the one thats restricting you cashwise and hes also the type of player that people will get frustrated with very quickly and will go down and price more like he probably will be 83 by the time we get to the next deadline blanks again against southampton hes going down again so i think hes fine if you if you can with withstand the price drops but i dont think i would include him on wild card unless i was going super cheap up front cool if he if he did blank at that southampton game i me jesus thatd be final straw for a lot of people thatd be like reas it be itd be a point two loss in a week easy i think weve touched on liverpool mainly just were all in agreement that two liverpool defenders are better than two liverpool attackers because we been asked about whether whos the best second liverpool attacker in your opinion would it be diaz jot or would you even consider s s saas like hes probably fine for his price but i just think when you start looking at other midfield options from other teams then you got to sacrifice a spot for him and i just its a bit like rice and rodri they will score a bunch of points this year but do i want to put one of them in instead of one of the many other great midfielders probably not if i was going now id probably still go jot because hes playing number nine but there is part of me that thinks longterm diaz minutes might be slightly better but its just a gut feeling more than anything but weve talked about so many midfielders in this in this pod and it just feels difficult to fit them in now i think theres so many good options thats all right weve said weve said already bakers got about 15 in his team already after suay there some i me we havent talk about madai i still like for the next four weeks like i think madai at 6 and a half is unb if i was going to punt on someone like bruno for example in that in that lets take a b i like i like his fixtures but again would you would you do it so the same price as sasl if you off be mad or s id go mad but i probably would too i think but im not sure id do either or any most like if i couldnt afford palmer i think id be more tempted maybe to look at something like him but no not me well theres a questions here saying the best four five defender is who would you who could you trust as a four five defender as your third playing defender third playing third playing others are 40 apparently i it probably would be someone like cono or pal torres i think like off top id have to go and research a bit more theres may be someone better but i just they got like one two four home games in the next six everton malls united bournemouth the two away games which and for him hes going to play like around champions league well see how they cope might not be great and like you said earlier they havent kept a huge amount of clean sheets there is worry that like hes not exciting but hes going to play so if you if you need someone thats safe maybe someone like him possibly robinson i just dont i dont rate ful and defense that much and i know hes got two assists last two games but thats going to slow down eventually and they aint going to get clean sheets i dont think not many fix still good though like f fixes are still good theyre all i think theyre all right like west ham and newcastle i could see both of those teams scoring then its an away game then its city away then its villa at home is tough then its another away game against everton i think i think their fixtures are worse than they look i dont mind the away games apart from city you dont expect the clean though youre just thinking hes so attacking leave davis and robinsons the same deal is that theyre so attacking and so integral to the attack that theres theres a good chance that they score goals they involved but playing them every week is difficult you ideally want tool them i do think theyre great options if youve got rico lewis like having one of those two because if they because they could even if they have got a bad fixture and they come in for rico they can still jam a 10pointer d has got seven points when they conceded and robinson got four is they can still jam something cool i think were good plenty to think about see sunday were back on sunday so we are speaking to john mckenzie and we need to give him something to talk about so well be working on that in the next few days and as always andy thank you for

not going to score at this pace the entire season can't keep this up famous yeah Famous Last WS Famous Last w i mean they're not going to get double digit HS every single week man oh I'm just going to cut all these courts keep going keep going oh this a thing hello everyone and welcome back to the F Banger show my name is civa I'm joined by Sam game week for Sam but you know we don't like to talk so much about what's going on in our lives and our teams and I really don't like it when people start off like that um so let's not talk about my amazing game week three let's not talk about my just just just tell us how many points you got don't need to tell how and you know how many points each play got just tell us how many points he got and we'll leave you at that I mean 98 points um I I don't want to I don't want to say that I told you so say that going for a walk yeah one week ahead of international Break Even though everyone said you shouldn't do that I don't want to say that I was right about all those things I mean I was right um and I'm I'm now way ahead of all the people who try to walk out without Pand I'm ahead of the people who like you Sam thought they could get away without one of Salah harand h basically I I accepted that I I could win FPL this season so enough about me Sam let's talk about you for sorry I'm rooting for you C I hope you win then at least we can tell people that at least one half of this part is good at F he he hey you know 35 weeks to go and all that but I'm very happy and I suppose this because you're on Wildcard this week right s mhm yeah yeah so with your wildcard active I suppose this is a really fascinating question about I went for the Salah and harand thing very early we talked about it in the last episode right because I wanted to afford a team with both of them but a lot of people who are listening are on W cart this week because people did want to wait for the break so tell me about how does that make you feel like are you off the doubles haland Salah thing do you think it's now too expensive if you didn't have them at the start or do you think it's still possible to build a team with the both of them I think it's still possible it's still possible well there do seem to be some gems here and there that you can you know you can UNF cheap gems so I think it's possible but definitely you have to make some sacrifices because I think you'll probably be like five lower in value compared to if you do it you did it like when you did it you know because it's not only harand and Salah who went up the enablers have gone up as well so a little 0.1 here 0.1 there yeah possible but harder definitely harder let's talk about some of these enablers right as we go along because we've got some some data that we've stolen SL borrowed from Reddit which I thought might be interesting it's only three weeks right but this one of the things we have up on screen now is attack positioning which I thought is it's kind of a cheat code if you don't watch games but although of course we do but for those who haven't you look at this chart and this is for Defenders who's at the top of the chart by a massive mile it's not a pre some some kind of some kind of glitch or wrong data or something man I don't believe man that's just facts that's Rico Lewis that's Rico Lewis basically turning into I don't know Kevin De bruy but for 4.6 million yeah let's see um he's attacking positioning from the bench in the next game okay but but you know it could be cuz we are recording this on Tuesday and England due to play Finland tonight and apparently Rico Lewis is starting so I'm sure pep will reward him appropriately over the weekend but something you know just cute for you to sort of look at this data I think moving on to midfielders and as you can see some interesting names here of course you see The Usual Suspects right this is attack positioning for mids and forwards salah's near the top harland's doing quite well J Diaz but then some people who maybe we're not giving enough respect to YN with Nicholas Jackson antoan SEO Marcus we've mentioned we've C respect to S I think in this part I mean we have but you know people who listen to Andy and all the other template you know boring template people who have Bruno a unu the same L you know same 11 players no offense all thas very high up surprisingly there you go so Brandon Johnson as well although not very high XG but lots of touches yeah and so maybe of course yes enablers have risen in price SE meno is up to 5.6 Morgan Rogers has gone up but maybe to your point set maybe there are more people out there we just need to open our minds you know you don't need to have Alexander isak if you could have Nicholas [Music] Jackson yes I guess so sound of all remaining listeners turning off the phones and watching but to be fair Lads of people are selling isak this week we'll probably get to that later on yeah yeah I mean Isa spoke about it uh he had an interview uh yesterday for Swedish TV and he said you know I hope people sell me because I'm going to score two goals against wolves but then he also did say if you play FPL you must own Holland so I I think he recognizes some some Scandinavian Nordic connection there that's well there must be right uh and speaking of harand and a lot of stuff about wild cards I me I'm guessing you you're facing the same issue is that I see a lot of people say he can't keep this up there's no way he can score this many goals forever if he keeps scoring he'll score 80 goals this season which will never happen so therefore he's due some sort of regression right and look at we've got a chart here most productive players in premier league history I thought this is really cool I saw this on Twitter this week and Holland not even on this chart that's how bad he is Sam as in he's so high that you can't even see him I mean yeah that's that's the point for those who are watching this video he's so he's if you look at this at First Class oh how didn't even make it he's so far ahead of anybody he's basically scoring a goal a game he actually no he's scoring more than a goal a game he's got like 70 goals in 69 games at this stage yep so my qu question to Someone Like You Sam and perhaps everybody in general is why can't he why can't he keep this up what if he keeps doing this what if he maybe not a hatrick every week but what if he keeps scoring a goal every week are you prepared to go without him well The Logical answer would be you should try to fit Harem in your team because he'll probably be the highest scoring player this year that would be the logical answer uh that's say he's not in my world cut team so I was waiting for the illogical part but it also comes back to that you know because I I know Sam you're not the only one a lot of people don't want to have him on wild cut because he's still really expensive and this is kind of a popular thing to still try and go against him and to be fair I think Salah keeping Pace has made everyone feel confident oh I can still try and do this without him some people are still getting green arrows without harand if you get your captains right but that's something that's so hard to do we spoke about it last week right when you try and Captain other guys a lot of people went for Saka last week and yes unlucky red card Brighton and all that for there you go yeah fair play to you worked for about two hours until the city game came on yeah and and the Liverpool game on but the point I guess is that yes you can try to be to get lucky that your non Harland Captain will outscore him but you know seven times out 10 harand will outscore that guy so it's it's a tough game to play but it's more fun that's my point um the proper way to play FPL is to get howand in because he will buy far be you know the best player now whether you want to double up halan and Salah that's a different story like that one I think it's still debatable but logically you should try and get Haren in I'm just you know I decided I decided at the start of the Season SAA that I'm going to try a whole season without Holland no matter what and I'm going to stick to it just for fun I guess guess makes things more fun um I don't know Sam I feel points are fun uh let's talk about okay so in your influ you know your decision not to go Harland I guess is largely also going to have to mean you have to address captaincy right and so we've got a chart on the screen which I very did some very basic work here just sort of setting out who would be the most common captains and again this is I guess if you're not going to go with harand now is the time to sell because yes brenford this week but then Arsenal Newcastle five and six so that's the I guess the hard fixtures if you have Harland why would you sell him like that's illogical if you went without Harland the whole time there still an argument that okay you want to try and make this right and you're confident that over a course of 10 games yes the first three games didn't work out the way you planned it but over the course of 10 games the savings that you made from Harland bought into the rest of your squad will prove worth it that I mean that's the that's the argument I guess but if you really have Holland to take him out now there that's that's that's crazy I'm pretty sure there are some people doing this I mean to your point right there are some people who are not going to go with him this week there are some people who didn't have him to begin with who are going to keep keep holding on just like you and that's not I don't think they're trying to be different like these people feel like they've done the math and they can work it out so I guess my question to those people is are you comfortable sort of moving captaincy around every week because as you can see in this chart right you got a captain Salah maybe in four and five if you don't have harand you probably have to go with Saka six and seven and I mean at some point harland's going to score another hattick in this run right y that's for sure and even you Sam surely at game that gaming n that gaming nine home game against Southampton looks and smell like a hatrick four goals maybe yes I mean even use Sam right I mean I know you want to make it fun but surely The Logical approach even if we try to take your your starting point which is you can get a better team without Haren you can have an amazing Midfield Palmer Saka Salah all those people is that maybe in game week eight you flip it and maybe you sell Salah ahead of Chelsea and arsal and you sell Palmer and then you get harand back in Sur that is probably the if you're going to try and do this thing where you rotate premiums yeah is that a more viable way yeah that would be the proper way I would say but that's just that would be a pure fixture player I guess you know you're hoping that with their favorable next three fixtures over Harland that they can outscore him and then you switch it back um yeah it's it's a possible option but I would say it's a high risk um it's a highrisk option highest ceiling for points definitely but you know if it doesn't go well then you're kind of screwed so I guess let me try and put it to you another way would you rather swap your premiums or would you rather spend transfers on swapping your budget guys because I think you you kind of have to choose you can't really do both I don't think you'll have enough transfers no matter how much you've rolled to do this premium hokey kooki as well as moving your Morgan Rogers to yagu and your Smith Rose to SOS like you got to have to pick what's your priority here so what do you think is more important that's a good point I guess the optimal way to play FPL will we to just keep Highland in you know switching captains switching premiums generally um doesn't really work out like you plann and I think the appeel of premiums themselves is that they are kind of fixture proof right you're paying that much because you know Highland can back against anyone um so that's why but like I said this is a it's a very risky move I would you know you have a higher chance of it not working out than it working out but if it does workout then you're ahead of the Highland captain and you know people have Highland so I feel like Holland and Salah again this is recency bias or whatever you want to call it but I feel Holland and Salah look like they have started on a slightly different level compared to the rest of these guys we're looking at and so I think for them the fixture proof argument applies whereas uh so har and Saka both uh you would have seen the news today have lost ODOT right arel have lost odard to injury might looks like he'll miss B probably miss City that immediately makes me feel far less confident in either Harvard Saka for the next two weeks it was already tough fixtures but I feel like they're not going to be fixture proof for that run Co Palmer I don't know Co Palmer you tell me because I was not impressed by Chelsea against Palace yeah but Palmer you know he still has his thing right just like the whole of last season I was not impressed by Chelsea at all but Palmer was basically fixer proof scoring and assist whenever he wants and he's not in the Europe Squad so it's fresh every game for the Premier League I guess but would you ever feel okay maybe I'm sort of bringing back his old price but would you ever feel comfortable captaining Palmer in any of these weeks I think if you if you look at it individually right um in a vacuum Palmer is definitely Captain aable home fixture against you know Brighton Forest that game Weck six game seven yeah is captain of if you look at him at a vacuum now is he the best Captain if you compare to Saka and Kai who have more favorable fixtures or you know Salah and harand then that's a different story yeah that's that's my thing like he's still he's still a captain asset that's what I'm saying I mean he's like but he's never I mean this is gami 4 to 12 we have on the screen I don't think in any of these weeks maybe 12 and even then it's debatable I say Salah as a clearer captain I don't think I want to Captain this guy between four to 12 y fair fair I think I would Captain Salah you know um four five six even maybe yeah so then BS the question why do you have coama I mean you're spending 10.6 you still have points I mean that's the same argument like if you have hen and Salah you know why you spending so much if you're not going to Captain him but I feel like those are the best two Captain SE like Palmer doesn't crack the top two in any of these weeks except for maybe game week 12 like you could just get Nicholas Jackson if you're going to do this you still get some goals Jackson has what two goals one assist I don't know maybe it's recency bias from you because you know I mean he has been performing well he has how many points has year he was only blanked in the first game week with second week or call Triple assist yeah but it's just I think Halen and Salah has warped our possession our perception of what a good asset is now um purely because of the start they made and who could have predicted it because um they are both on how 41 am I right right which is the most any player has ever scored in FPL in the first three weeks you know um so it's an anomaly I feel it will even not they're still going to be great assets but they're not going to score at this pace the entire season can't keep this famous yeah Famous Last WS famous last I mean they're not going to get double digit HS every single week man oh I'm just going to cut all these courts keep going keep going but yeah yeah so I mean as they regress a bit as is expected statistically you know then they'll come closer tow what bmer and Saka I people are transferring out Saka because they've been disappointed with his points and he's been he's been scoring so I think our perception of you know how many points a player should get in three weeks have been you know totally skewed by Haren and Salah start okay okay uh very reasonable take Sam I must say it it's I think if roles have come full circle here I'm the one who's no I mean it's okay if you want to fit both of them in but I think it's also okay to go without one and spread try and spread the funds around because spammer itself is already like two me cheaper than Salah you know and two can go a long way in your defense or upgrading your 5.0 Morgan Rogers to to a 7.0 someone okay fair enough um I included son just for argument sake but um as I included him I just thought would I I don't even want son like I had him for those first two weeks I was happy to get the hall against Everton but I sold him immediately and I think not going to look back I thought Spurs were bad against Newcastle and Sun's just not he's not worth 10 yeah I think Spurs just as a whole doesn't really look as impressive um as his points would suggest I guess it feels like they've just C carried on where they left off last season you know some good moments but then one one pass through the defense and then all just falls apart doesn't seem like they progressed in any way yep agreed agreed okay so as we GE up to your wild card reveal Sam because obviously at the end of this we're going to show your mind blowing wild card so stay tuned for that like uh like this will change everything so let's let's talk about fixtures so we can try and figure out where you got to on your wild card uh I guess biggest target here for you is what I don't know Brighton maybe yeah yeah I think in the immediate next two games no team has it better than Brighton that's what two home games against uh it switch against Forest doesn't get any better than that so which Brighton assets are we talking Welbeck Pedro Min H I have stats from FB ref so the Brighton player with the most go involement is mtoa who is in my team I wi for M very well balanced um 1.0 XG 1.0 XA a nice 2.0 goal involvement uh one goal and assist already so far so everything looks out well right one XC one goal one XA one assist balance as all things should be now m is not that far behind you know and he's he's one whole meal cheaper so if you you I inclined to go that way and there's been a lot of talk on how um they are weak on his side right um because Li Davis is very attacking so they tend to leave space there space that me can very well exploit so he's not that far behind only 1.8 um expected gold involvement which is really good more XA than XG though which is why it went for M I think yes I I feel MTO has a higher ceiling and possibly more nailed to play throughout the whole match I think fair and then behind him you have well back you have J Pedro well at 1.6 and Jed is down at one so those are the four options I think you look for in the team I I'm really happy with mtoa I think it's a big differential as well not many people have gone mtoa so I'm I'm happy with mtoa yeah I think a lot of people just can't make the I mean especially people want to have both Hala and Salah so that's your benefit if you're going to go without one of the premiums you can afford Moma over M talk to me about Welbeck and Pedro because I went Pedro just okay that I must say I sort of uh went with the template pick right he's boring he's on pens but I he does play really deep and obviously if you're going in this week he's in the Brazil squad late call up which is really annoying um so I guess if you're on wild cut this week do you not gamble with Welbeck I think it's a really tough um decision because wellb has shown you know we the the good thing of wellbank is we have loads of data from his past seasons and he shown that he can't keep this he can't keep SC like this uh he'll be good in Bates but you know he's not going to score 10 goals I think he's never scored more than 12 goals in a season or something like that right maybe lower I can't remember what's the stat so I guess J Pedro would be a safer pick long term mostly because of pants you know and if I'm not mistaken last week he played 90 minutes so his play seems even more secure than it should be of course of course this week in particular he's a risk you know may come on late may not play at all may start we we don't know but over a long term I think Xiao Pedro would be the better pick over wellbe so if I were to W cut and I wanted Brighton's you know forward I would still go ja Pedro and just take the risk you know he might come on in the last 20 minutes which possible that he can still score you know coming on and just take the the so-called hit this week I guess um take that City but then be secured for the next few weeks I think in the priz bracket there are no other forwards better than both of them and I would pick Pedro over wellbe in the long like for season I think your kid heard you [ __ ] talking Danny Welbeck and said no this got to stop man I mean United Legend Arsenal Legend Danny Welbeck although I did check you are right never Brighton Legend he's never scored 10 goals in a season that's crazy because he's so injury Pro His Highest nine three times with United um but one thing about wellbe and you talked about price ranges why not just have both on wild card I know yes it sounds crazy double Brighton attack why but they're both 5.7 you have no decent forwards under six you barely have any decent forwards above six right people have Adam Armstrong okay Chris Wood being the exception uh chriswood obviously worldclass player um I'm surpassing all expectations uh I suppose if you can bench Chris Wood then chriswood is the guy to have at Wild cut because Forest fixture still look great right um and yeah first choice but yeah why not just have Welbeck and Pedro run with it for a few weeks good fixtures what's the big deal here 5.7 million rather than people like you Sam I know you're going to be cheap and put a 4.5 million forward on your bench who's never going to play um and so you're exactly and so you're one injury away from being in trouble why not 1.2 million don't tell me you don't have 1.2 million are you saying to play one and bench one no just have both for these next two play both and at the end of that process Play 3 43 yeah because what I feel about Welbeck is we are doing that classic thing of you and I we have seen Welbeck we know who Welbeck is therefore we're not going to go for him because we know too much but I spoke to my so so my my brother-in-law is the most casual person that's ever lived and and talk is oh I got well back he's scoring points right so I got well back and the the average FPL dude is just going to be like this dude scoring goals he's getting minutes he is well played what almost 90 minutes in gaming two he's not fluking these goals so and he's 5.7 I mean when it goes wrong you don't care because there's nobody at his price who's doing this anyway so just have him and treat him as your eighth attacker it's possible I guess the argument then would be when you go for a 5.56 s midfielder versus you know a well back so it's es ESR and play 352 versus well back and play 343 kind of exactly arent we're talking about how brittle Welbeck is I mean no offense I love Smith row but I mean all these assle players are made of glass anyway so it's if it's between Welbeck and Smith R surely back is comparable no maybe I guess most people are just kind of worried about having two players from the same team who are not if they're not a big team but that's not how you should think about these things right it's not about they individually decent assets on their own you don't care whether you have two of the same team fa I appreciate your point sa it's just it just feels wrong to both them it just feels so wrong but perhaps so wrong that right and I think once again I think this is a classic case of people have never watched Brighton this season Danny wel is playing number nine ja Pedro's playing number 10 if this were any other team you'd be talking about the forward but because we are all FPL people who have played for so many years we know who Welbeck is we're like I'm never going to want Danny Welbeck I would never go near him and I don't think that's I I think that is not how you look at this you're bringing your your pass buers into it yeah maybe which is why I went me over all of them I don't trust other guys I trust M Japan Jersey on for him today oh Fair fa Fair okay uh okay so speaking of uh less templ picks I I want to try and put something crazy to you Sam because I feel like no one's taking me seriously on this so maybe I can try and convince you because I'm in the market for a forward uh and I've been looking at somebody who has scored during the during the international break he plays a promoted team this week weak very leaky defense he's nailed to start um very good on XG like I think he had point8 XG last in game week three I like him affordable all the good things that I I know who you're talking about yeah so I me who who who am I talking about um can you give me a Joshua zi yeah Josh zi so I I don't get why I feel like the all the push back on Joshua Z because again too many content creators all fans and so they bring in all this you know or this is the worst Club ever because you all lost the game which you were always going to lose anyway which to be fair I'm going to push a little bit of United agenda here but I felt that the loss the score line was worse than how it looked we had we just did not have Salah at the end of those chances we had rash you had zy and zuky yeah which comes back to my point I I mean he did really well over the international break I'm op cautiously optimistic for United's prospects over the next few weeks but I feel the best asset you the best United asset to have which I already said last week is Alejandro gacho not even nailed mate I mean zi is safer than this guy no no no gacho will start he he he's in my team this team I I respect you Sam but gachu would be lucky to reach Southampton in time for this fixture he will play He's our best attacker I think um D can see that now he's second highest in X Spector involvement highest in XG despite only starting one game 1.4 XG so all the stats all the signs the it test the stats All Points towards Alejandro gacho I'm so not feeling this okay I I'll I'll let you have your gacho thing if he's minutes to a nailed I would be more interested I don't think he's minil I don't know why uh he seems to like giving Dio starts and mixing it with rashford uh but humor me on zi because I really feel like people are missing out here you have a nailed forward 90 minutes against I think we all agree Southampton is the worst team in the league right yeah MH they've got this Kami Kazi where defending where they just pass it around their box until somebody takes it from them and scores and I think J zi yes he's had misses but again we we like forward to get to scoring positions right we don't mind if they miss a few chances uh he's obviously not had preseason so he's not sharp but as you saw in international break very good improvised finish I think that's confidence right he scores a backwards header which M seems impressive to me Southampton Palace Spurs three decent enough fixtures if you have to hold 7 mil what what's what's the big deal here why are people so reluctant I would rather have other players than zi name I think that's the argument at 7.0 I would rather have well back I would rather have wha despite the bad fixtures you don't want wi City mate come on let's be real I think I don't think brenford are going to win but can they score one possible against city has an exactly look water typ but I mean if you're not talking about just this one fixture talking about the next you know five fixture oriv I just don't have very much confidence in United but perhaps United bias you can say that sure sure but I've said it you know I said it last week as well the only player I see for United that worth having is G I'm just not keen on the rest okay all right I talk to me about uh Bruno because a lot of people are considering selling Bruno this week for Salah so how do you feel about that I did the same thing on my wild cut of course but yeah scored International break is he not back I think um gacho is better if you're going to have one that that's my argument I mean the fixture look looks good I I can see points coming from here I'm not saying he's going to blank although you know he probably will I'm just saying that I think ghu is a better asset to have so if you're on wild card and you have you know um you have the opportunity to shift your funds around I would take the savings I get by getting gacho instead and then use the extra money somewhere else you you're going to tell me that the guy who's not nailed to start who's in Argentina to day is better than the guy who is nailed to start will play 90 minutes and is on penalties yeah yes that is what I'm saying SAA take it from United fan and I would think a lot of United fans would Echo this sentiment that um gacho looks like our most dangerous player and therefore the biggest source of points no I think I think a lot of United fans want gacha to be their most dangerous player because they look they watch him play and think this guy is so exciting why we aren't we playing him every every game and for 90 minutes but your where your it All Falls Down is your manager is a ball guy who's really boring and he's not GNA play gacho every week he will play Bruno every week he will keep Bruno on for the most of the game and Bruno is the guy on penalties and I'm surprised Sam because you had Bruno to start the season and I feel like this is surviv what is it survivors bias survivors trauma I don't know PTSD because you've owned him for his blanks which we all agree have been unlucky you are now not going to own him for his points and I can already picture you coming back in game five to tell me oh I sold Bruno just before his 17p point Hall yeah it's possible although he hasn't really had a big Point hall for some time you know yeah but Sur even even last season right I his points has been more spread he hasn't been the Bruno as when he first came with a very high ceiling and scoring every game by the way SAA it's not just it test okay or not just United wishing the stats say that gacho is almost dangerous player so he is he is like that that is the fact now his nness is an issue is a point of concern if you don't want to go gacho because you're worried that he might not start then that's a valid point but don't come and tell me that he's not our most dangerous player you know he has the highest of second highest expected goal involement but think a lot less minutes so if you account for the minutes then he is definitely well according to FB ref if I count for the minutes play our most dous play is Anthony who created 0.1 XG in one minute of play so he expected going bolman per minute is through the roof but below him is gacho so I will stand I'll stand by it that Gano is the best United asset to have okay we spent too much time talking about a mtable team let's try and move on uh other teams are wild cart Sam I guess that you are looking at Villa is really tricky because they have such a nice run of fixtures but everyone it's kind of traumatized because you know Bailey hasn't returned Watkins hasn't returned Morgan Rogers has not returned that's say they all link to each other right if if Walkins has scor Morgan Rogers have written so we have got an assist I am half tempted to go for Watkins in this fixure R because if you apply that same logic to Bruno SAA oh he's just unlucky it's the same for wkins right now he's not nailed I mean he should be nailed he came off early in the last game but I mean it's Watkins and his Villa right he there's no way that he'll be dropped probably just still building up Fitness I know you're looking at me just why is it because John Duran has scor like how how can Watkins possibly be nail for the guy who comes on and scores within 10 seconds I mean yeah but it's Watkins come on I mean Perhaps Perhaps again this is yeah fast biases Perhaps Perhaps a part of me wants to take that risk because his XG has been great you know 1.6 XG ific one of the highest in the league aside from a few super humans like like hen Salah amongst humans yeah sure amongst humans one of the highest although yon Visa is doing really well as well but anyway still point is he's getting into good position CS has not been scoring if he gets back to his old self you could see him scoring quite a lot of points in this you know this fixture run four very nice fixtures Everton woles at home one game away against iswitch and then another home game against United away against Fulham home game against bonth like those are all very scorable fixtures I like the Watkins Pi more than the gacha one I think I can grant you I think Watkins as you say unlucky and even though his minutes have been bad um this is a good week because Duran is again in Colombia and they come back later so if Watkins was ever going to get 90 and Watkins didn't go with away with England right he stayed back so this is as good a chance as any need to try and get 90 minutes and Everton suck basically so yeah I mean I that's a good differential I think because start the season I think a lot of people had Watkins but most people have sold him already by now yeah so I I don't mind the Watkins uh move as much you take it because you and I suspect this is a byproduct of you having so much cash Morgan Rogers is not in your consideration yeah it's not because I don't need a 5.0 enabler but if you do I think he still still the best option in that price range yeah underlying stats have been poor but I'm I'm P to keep obviously I feel I scored for the under 21s yesterday two goals yeah you I feel like it's coming you just want you want to be patient I think yeah I mean if he comes for Walkins then he will come for Rogers right it's all linked so I guess either way we can't lose okay so Villa aside I suppose Villa defend is nothing much to talk about either you'll flip a coin between pow and conza you're not going anywhere right yeah even then they haven't really been solid defensively yeah so you might want one just for the fixtures and because it's Skip and maybe just put on the bench if you have three other starting Defenders okay fair any other teams worth speaking about I think that's it right team wise fixture wise at least e let's talk about a for a bit right I be interested to know if he makes your wild card team go 6.9 now so cheaper and Palace have had a strong end to the window I feel like they've kind of remedied a lot of the issues yeah obviously as was brilliant against chelse see so not tempted tempted but there are only so few Midfield slots I guess he would be my I don't know sixth or seventh best Midfield pick I would say again I guess because you've got the budget right so you're not tempted by 6.9 yeah yeah yeah I'll go g over inexplicable GH love yeah I just hope ten hog feels it as much as you do mate uh in terms of uh for for those who don't have your your funds okay you really didn't seem sold on Nicholas Jackson so I won't push that with you but back to a though I just want to say that if you do have a he is definitely a longterm ho you know I know quite a few people sold him after the first two weeks only for him to return but maybe again past bias maybe but you could also consider history as data right and the data has shown that he's his points are usually spread out over a long period of time he's not really a streaky player return you know like in big points in five games or three games so thing right so points will be spread out but it's definitely a good asset to have that's for sure yeah I think if I was going on a wild card again this week i' definitely just have embo and a and just like leave them there season Keepers similar prices on pant Talisman you don't ever think about it again the B's a tough one because brenford has really I mean they have City away this week and then Spurs away as well so two tough away games so if you're on wild cut like me I'm this decision has been really hard for me um do I just keep Amo despite the two tough fixtures to save me from a transfer in later on because then they have two nice home fixtures I think longterm is a good pick it's just can I do that the Hokey pokei you know out in you know maybe um mtoa for the the next two fixtures and then transfer in foro you know just playing the fixtures kind of thing or is it not worth the trouble and then just leaving in them there so that is a debate that I'm having I still don't have an answer for that S I guess also I mean consideration is because you got him in at seven both of us did right and now he's up to 7.1 which and that makes a difference we had two questions about in bore basic and THS 798 asking walk out questions B basically do you go Saka and Wisa or harvon and bore I have Harton and bomo but I think in view of the Ard injury I'd actually just say drop the Arsenal attackers completely on wot and I actually wouldn't mind getting embo and WIA again um huh interesting interesting Z and you know they have the exact same fixtures in the next two yep true so if you take fixture out the equation pure points potential Che you think so yeah no I mean if if you were set on having one from each team I don't know man I think you just find the budget and get Saka and Saka Ando I mean you forward slot if they want you know answer the questions if you had to pick one of the two options it's very disingenous because I have havs and WIA but yeah obviously today if you ask me I'll pick Saka and B just I mean Saka WIA for the fact that Sak's role is safer and even though I think Harvard is much better as a nine I think the odard injury forces forces him back into Midfield whereas Saka will still play wherever he plays and will just be a safer pick fair I think plus UMO has been doing really well stats wise I mean sorry UMO WIA has been doing really well sawi so and ultimately no Tony right so that helps with so much yeah okay I'm with you I'm with you with a question from Ignatius finishing up uh with terms of fixtures Bowen and a 4.5 defender or Trent and a 5 million mid I mean basically Tren and Rogers versus J even talk about West Ham Oren does that yeah feel unfair maybe I think their fixtures has not turned enough yet for us to fully consider although Bowen has been quietly doing the business right as expected I think I did shout out Jared Bowen a few weeks back um I predict him to have a really good season yeah yeah scor g no he didn't score in gimick one he scored gimick two assist in game three so two go involement in the past three games and one of them was against City I think Bowen will be a really good asset to have he only 7.5 it's just finding that that point to jump in you know where's that the nice entry point because there are so many other midfielders you can get for example you know we already mentioned Brighton next two fixures definitely better than West Ham who so the next two fures fullam away Chelsea home then brenford away also a pretty tough fixture so where is that nice jumping on point you have to decide that yourself I guess but in a vacuum J great asset I would love to have Jo my team yeah so I think I guess is just a safer pick than a lot of these 7 million mids right and probably even you can even say 8 million Ms but I guess let's wrap up wild cart chat about Liverpool cuz that's going to be hardest decision this week surely you are tempted I know logically lot of people are saying Trent Robo Salah safe boring you know what you're getting Liverpool haven't conceded a goal yet so look really solid I can see from your eye you're not sold I'm not so on double double Liverpool defense because I think they have been you going to say somewhat lucky somewhat lucky to have kept three CLE sheets back to back because they they have been conceding chances especially against United you know they considered an X of 1.3 so they were lucky in that sense that United was just so bad at finishing United's a good team buddy I mean surprising to as it may be to United fans see again I feel like you're mentally downgrading this actually no United is a good team they've been playing well in fact I think that we played aside from the mistakes we play as well as Liverpool we just the players were failing at the final you know we at the final ball so it's getting the ball to R and seeing what he does versus getting the ball to Salah and seeing what he does one results in a goal one results in a Mis chance but do you not so okay so fair right so United a good team and therefore XG being put up against Liverpool's right whereas now now lipol play what Forest Bou wolves Palace could probably keep for clean sheets back to back I don't know first of all that's Chris Wood I don't see a clinch in that match now what I'm saying is that I I don't think they are the best defensive team in the league despite the fact that the only want who kep CLE three clean sheets again very small sample size how many times in F have we Seena in history that I think he clean three clean sheits in a row and then proceeds to not clean she for the next 10 very possible yeah but I say this time fixtures right we're not just banking on them being a good defense per se so I I would get one of Tren and Robo I think two getting both of is just too much money spending in like Robertson six you could get m in Midfield I would be fairly confident that M can match or maybe has a higher ceiling over the next two games in particular you know I like how you lost confidence in that sentence yeah okay okay so I will go two forwards cuz I think Liverpool will look much more exciting attacking wise rather than defensively so I will go for two Liverpool attackers and one Defender I really like yes but it does concern me that he's flying back so late and the fact they have capable Replacements so and the fact that he keeps getting subed off no yeah yeah like this man has no respect for hatrick rules he just keeps taking him off yeah so it's been you know I think a few people have spoke about the fact that he likes to bring off his Wingers and so far we've seen that it's true he does he really does like to bring off his Wingers at 60 70 minutes he does seem to be the one you know benefiting the most I guess from um of course two goals against United so maybe that skewes it a bit I think there's very little to separate between jot and DS so I'm happy still keeping J in the team although if you were in cl to go DS I think it's a good option as well don't don't don't give me that answer pick one you know gun you're on W no no you're on wut M you got to pick one so who who you going with J okay so purely because of Colombia basically um yeah I think so yes okay let me bring up the stats and let's see who has been getting more you know XT and stuff like that almost dead even I I mean I've already looked at this oh yeah okay so 1.8 XT Diaz 1.8 jota 1.6 so really close not much to separate between them yeah all right fair I think what helps jot is replacement is Da and yunes and DS's replacement is gakpo and I think I know which one I would rather which I don't know I I I think D is definitely not slot's favorite player I think I think the early indications would suggest that okay I think slot wants less chaos and he wants a lot more control that's true that's a good point yeah yeah I think he wants a control to press he doesn't like this thing where I think da and Bruno you know some of these guys like to press without just sort of like hold the R2 button and run around a lot yeah slots a bit more measured okay fair okay uh all right I think we've spent a lot of time let's let's go to the reveal I was going to do this like position by position but Life's Too Short let's let's let's crack on right uh this is y WKA team as of yesterday so presumably this is 10 drafts ago um already out of I've only changed one play in the no in the my wild cut team okay let's introduce it for the podcast listeners first okay so you got Rya and go Anthony Robinson Trent Lewis uh in Midfield you got jot Salah embo mtoa Palmer up top you have isak and bench of 4.0 keeper coner Greaves and a 4.5 forward who no longer plays in the Premier League so talk to me um I I still think Rya is worth getting purely a long term because you know you you can do the hok Ki with your other positions but keeper is one that I think you just just get one that you're happy to leave long term Rya is the cheapest um Arsenal Defender that you can get Arsenal still one of the best defensive teams in the Premier League maybe the yes so right at this I I don't see you know saliva and Gabrielle really outscoring him that much that that proves worth the outlay the trend yeah sorry go ahead with the injuries right to rise guard I think this just makes ARA way more defensive already we're quite defensive team we have five center backs six center backs each is going to be more defensive so I think we discussed this at start of the Season Aral and tough fix is actually not a bad idea for defense because they will play for in and take it quite happily mhm yeah so Tren don't I don't think you need to explain Tren Robinson as well the best five 4.5 is he still 4.5 4.6 now 4.6 yeah the best um defended G that range zero clean shits but you know sary game or something like that so it's fine it's fine for 4.5 we talked about louw has to be in your team I think yeah I mean if people who don't want him you're scared of one occasional benching you'll be my guest mate but this guy's levels pep just is going to keep saying it every week best player I've ever seen oh my God he's amazing just just accept it yeah and I mean if you're on Wild Card just make sure you have a good bench so I have coner on my bench so if L really gets you know dropped cons comes in that's fine right I'm happy with that so that's the benefit of being on wild cut I guess Midfield again don't really need to explain J Salah we already talked about it again I already talked about me Tom I'm still thinking UMO so I I've changed UMO to gacho in my actual one that I have not sent to use but I'm not 100% sold on that because again I definitely will wanto in so this is just purely a fixture play mtoa next to moves too do we want to plan in a transfer like that or should we just leave him in and save those transfers I'm still debating on that and the debate will probably go on all the way to deadline so don't have an answer for your listeners same with Palmer as well uh with a brandley carrying a minor knock although fix just look good so I probably will still keep Palmer in the team Harvard's is a point of debate as well so like we discussed earlier with the injury to Ard how much of that will affect I've seen some talk that he might be moved deeper hav it to accommodate for other got um cuz you don't do you have another player I think Fab via is out who used to be the replacement right out on loan yeah yeah so you don't really have an AM to fit to play in ard's position but nobody exactly I'm a bit put off by havitz you know you can take him out and then again you're doing the hok Ki but then two weeks later when they have good fixtures OD theat probably will be back by then hopefully rise as well then you can bring your Arsenal players back in again you are planning transfers which I don't necessarily like because things never work out as it planed when it comes to transfers but yeah it's an option and isak I'm happy is I'm keeping isak again like I mentioned last week he returns when he's fit if he's fit have isak I I think isach I'm fine with I guess this is I guess my question to you and this is see you don't have harand but you have Harvard and Palmer and I suppose a non a team with Harland would lose Palmer probably for Rogers and that's where the difference comes so I I guess my question to you is what do you doing know because your Harvard's position is quite crucial because that's your big differentiating point from a Salah team where what do you do because there aren't that many good forwards in this game yeah so like I mentioned Watkins is an option although you know he's significantly more expensive so I will have to move some funds around here and there you could go down yeah possibly possibly you could go down um drop har to a Pedro uh well back or something like that it's possible so I guess the fun thing about not having Highland is this challenge of okay because I don't have Highland I need to spread it out how there are many combinations in which I can do it whereas if you have hland you're kind of stuck like I need to have Morgan Rogers and that's it so it does makes it more fun in that sense you know I relented and got Salah in because U I don't know I feel like you still you still can have fun with Salah there's still enough money going around that I can you know I can have this nice debate throughout the week in my head should I get this PA this play is it worth it where if you're Highland your so your team is kind of stuck so I'm doing it purely for vipes definitely not the optimal way to play FPL lers do not follow what I'm doing say it properly it's not it's not a bad team I mean like I said it's probably just two players off a harand Salah optimal team so and like you said You' got way more flexibility so whereas I have next to no flexibility my transfer this week is going to be either M or Welbeck and you are picking from the likes of Moma and Watkins so there are different there are levels to this yeah yeah and I guess the idea is that over a longer fixture run yes the first three fixtures have been a disaster if you went without Harland but over the cost of 10 games because you would expect your your you know the likes of mtoa to outscore Morgan Rogers especially over a 10 game run right so then that's where the idea is that that's when you really see the value of going without harand so let's see let's see let's see how it goes okay all good points uh I think we're done right sir yep I think so longer episode than I thought we would but it's been it's been good s your wild card was mildly interesting I must say I think it's mild because I mean it's a it's taking a lot of let's say you know balls basically to activate the the biggest chip in the game and still not go with the guy who SC the most points debatable I mean if he blanks this week you're you're in heaven right you're just betting on one guy to blank so you never know yep in the in the three weeks in a season where he blanks I'll be on Heaven [Laughter] 35 to be fair it's not even blanking right you just you're fine if he scores one goal that's all you really want you know just stop scoring hat tricks basically yeah stop doing it every week colen okay all right okay so I think we're done but we'll see you in time for game week five but in the meantime sir yeah get your green arrows guys have a good week [Music],10304,so its an anomaly i feel it will even out theyre still going to be great assets but theyre not going to score at this pace the entire season cant keep this up famous famous last ws famous last w theyre not going to get double digit hs every single week man im just going to cut all these courts keep going keep going this a thing hello everyone and welcome back to the f banger show my name is civa im joined by sam game week for sam we dont like to talk so much about whats going on in our lives and our teams and i dont like it when people start off like that so lets not talk about my amazing game week three lets not talk about my just tell us how many points you got dont need to tell how and how many points each play got just tell us how many points he got and well leave you at that 98 points i dont want to i dont want to say that i told you so say that going for a walk one week ahead of international break even though everyone said you shouldnt do that i dont want to say that i was right about all those things i was right and im im now way ahead of all the people who try to walk out without pand im ahead of the people who like you sam thought they could get away without one of salah harand h i accepted that i could win fpl this season so enough about me sam lets talk about you for sorry im rooting for you c i hope you win then at least we can tell people that at least one half of this part is good at f he hey 35 weeks to go and all that but im very happy and this because youre on wildcard this week right s mhm so with your wildcard active this is a fascinating question about i went for the salah and harand thing very early we talked about it in the last episode right because i wanted to afford a team with both of them but a lot of people who are listening are on w cart this week because people did want to wait for the break so tell me about how does that make you feel like are you off the doubles haland salah thing do you think its now too expensive if you didnt have them at the start or do you think its still possible to build a team with the both of them i think its still possible its still possible well there do seem to be some gems here and there that you can you can unf cheap gems so i think its possible but definitely you have to make some sacrifices because i think youll probably be like five lower in value compared to if you do it you did it like when you did it because its not only harand and salah who went up the enablers have gone up as well so a little 01 here 01 there possible but harder definitely harder lets talk about some of these enablers right as we go along because weve got some data that weve stolen sl borrowed from reddit which i thought might be interesting its only three weeks right but this one of the things we have up on screen now is attack positioning which i thought is its a cheat code if you dont watch games but although of course we do but for those who havent you look at this chart and this is for defenders whos at the top of the chart by a massive mile its not a pre some some glitch or wrong data man i dont believe man thats just facts thats rico lewis thats rico lewis turning into i dont know kevin de bruy but for 46m lets see hes attacking positioning from the bench in the next game okay but it could be cuz we are recording this on tuesday and england due to play finland tonight and apparently rico lewis is starting so im sure pep will reward him appropriately over the weekend but something just cute for you to look at this data i think moving on to midfielders and as you can see some interesting names here of course you see the usual suspects right this is attack positioning for mids and forwards salahs near the top harlands doing quite well j diaz but then some people who maybe were not giving enough respect to yn with nicholas jackson antoan seo marcus weve mentioned weve c respect to s i think in this part we have people who listen to andy and all the other template boring template people who have bruno a unu the same l same 11 players no offense all thas very high up surprisingly there you go so brandon johnson as well although not very high xg but lots of touches and so maybe of course yes enablers have risen in price se meno is up to 56 morgan rogers has gone up but maybe to your point set maybe there are more people out there we just need to open our minds you dont need to have alexander isak if you could have nicholas jackson yes so sound of all remaining listeners turning off the phones and watching but to be fair lads of people are selling isak this week well probably get to that later on isa spoke about it he had an interview yesterday for swedish tv and he said i hope people sell me because im going to score two goals against wolves but then he also did say if you play fpl you must own holland so i think he recognizes some scandinavian nordic connection there thats well there must be right and speaking of harand and a lot of stuff about wild cards i me im guessing youre facing the same issue is that i see a lot of people say he cant keep this up theres no way he can score this many goals forever if he keeps scoring hell score 80 goals this season which will never happen so therefore hes due some regression right and look at weve got a chart here most productive players in premier league history i thought this is cool i saw this on twitter this week and holland not even on this chart thats how bad he is sam as in hes so high that you cant even see him thats thats the point for those who are watching this video hes so hes if you look at this at first class how didnt even make it hes so far ahead of anybody hes scoring a goal a game he no hes scoring more than a goal a game hes got like 70 goals in 69 games at this stage yep so my qu question to someone like you sam and perhaps everybody in general is why cant he why cant he keep this up what if he keeps doing this what if he maybe not a hatrick every week but what if he keeps scoring a goal every week are you prepared to go without him well the logical answer would be you should try to fit harem in your team because hell probably be the highest scoring player this year that would be the logical answer thats say hes not in my world cut team so i was waiting for the illogical part but it also comes back to that because i know sam youre not the only one a lot of people dont want to have him on wild cut because hes still expensive and this is a popular thing to still try and go against him and to be fair i think salah keeping pace has made everyone feel confident i can still try and do this without him some people are still getting green arrows without harand if you get your captains right but thats something thats so hard to do we spoke about it last week right when you try and captain other guys a lot of people went for saka last week and yes unlucky red card brighton and all that for there you go fair play to you worked for about two hours until the city game came on and the liverpool game on but the point is that yes you can try to be to get lucky that your non harland captain will outscore him seven times out 10 harand will outscore that guy so its its a tough game to play but its more fun thats my point the proper way to play fpl is to get howand in because he will buy far be the best player now whether you want to double up halan and salah thats a different story like that one i think its still debatable but logically you should try and get haren in im just i decided i decided at the start of the season saa that im going to try a whole season without holland no matter what and im going to stick to it just for fun guess makes things more fun i dont know sam i feel points are fun lets talk about okay so in your influ your decision not to go harland is largely also going to have to mean you have to address captaincy right and so weve got a chart on the screen which i very did some very basic work here just setting out who would be the most common captains and again this is if youre not going to go with harand now is the time to sell because yes brenford this week but then arsenal newcastle five and six so thats the the hard fixtures if you have harland why would you sell him like thats illogical if you went without harland the whole time there still an argument that okay you want to try and make this right and youre confident that over a course of 10 games yes the first three games didnt work out the way you planned it but over the course of 10 games the savings that you made from harland bought into the rest of your squad will prove worth it that thats the thats the argument but if you have holland to take him out now there thats thats thats crazy im pretty sure there are some people doing this to your point right there are some people who are not going to go with him this week there are some people who didnt have him to begin with who are going to keep holding on just like you and thats not i dont think theyre trying to be different like these people feel like theyve done the math and they can work it out so my question to those people is are you comfortable moving captaincy around every week because as you can see in this chart right you got a captain salah maybe in four and five if you dont have harand you probably have to go with saka six and seven and at some point harlands going to score another hattick in this run right y thats for sure and even you sam surely at game that gaming n that gaming nine home game against southampton looks and smell like a hatrick four goals maybe yes even use sam right i know you want to make it fun but surely the logical approach even if we try to take your starting point which is you can get a better team without haren you can have an amazing midfield palmer saka salah all those people is that maybe in game week eight you flip it and maybe you sell salah ahead of chelsea and arsal and you sell palmer and then you get harand back in sur that is probably the if youre going to try and do this thing where you rotate premiums is that a more viable way that would be the proper way i would say but thats just that would be a pure fixture player youre hoping that with their favorable next three fixtures over harland that they can outscore him and then you switch it back its its a possible option but i would say its a high risk its a highrisk option highest ceiling for points definitely if it doesnt go well then youre screwed so let me try and put it to you another way would you rather swap your premiums or would you rather spend transfers on swapping your budget guys because i think you have to choose you cant do both i dont think youll have enough transfers no matter how much youve rolled to do this premium hokey kooki as well as moving your morgan rogers to yagu and your smith rose to sos like you got to have to pick whats your priority here so what do you think is more important thats a good point the optimal way to play fpl will we to just keep highland in switching captains switching premiums generally doesnt work out like you plann and i think the appeel of premiums themselves is that they are fixture proof right youre paying that much because highland can back against anyone so thats why but like i said this is a its a very risky move i would you have a higher chance of it not working out than it working out but if it does workout then youre ahead of the highland captain and people have highland so i feel like holland and salah again this is recency bias or whatever you want to call it but i feel holland and salah look like they have started on a slightly different level compared to the rest of these guys were looking at and so i think for them the fixture proof argument applies whereas so har and saka both you would have seen the news today have lost odot right arel have lost odard to injury might looks like hell miss b probably miss city that immediately makes me feel far less confident in either harvard saka for the next two weeks it was already tough fixtures but i feel like theyre not going to be fixture proof for that run co palmer i dont know co palmer you tell me because i was not impressed by chelsea against palace but palmer he still has his thing right just like the whole of last season i was not impressed by chelsea at all but palmer was fixer proof scoring and assist whenever he wants and hes not in the europe squad so its fresh every game for the premier league but would you ever feel okay maybe im bringing back his old price but would you ever feel comfortable captaining palmer in any of these weeks i think if you if you look at it individually right in a vacuum palmer is definitely captain aable home fixture against brighton forest that game weck six game seven is captain of if you look at him at a vacuum now is he the best captain if you compare to saka and kai who have more favorable fixtures or salah and harand then thats a different story thats thats my thing like hes still hes still a captain asset thats what im saying hes like but hes never this is gami 4 to 12 we have on the screen i dont think in any of these weeks maybe 12 and even then its debatable i say salah as a clearer captain i dont think i want to captain this guy between four to 12 y fair i think i would captain salah four five six even maybe so then bs the question why do you have coama youre spending 106 you still have points thats the same argument like if you have hen and salah why you spending so much if youre not going to captain him but i feel like those are the best two captain se like palmer doesnt crack the top two in any of these weeks except for maybe game week 12 like you could just get nicholas jackson if youre going to do this you still get some goals jackson has what two goals one assist i dont know maybe its recency bias from you because he has been performing well he has how many points has year he was only blanked in the first game week with second week or call triple assist but its just i think halen and salah has warped our possession our perception of what a good asset is now purely because of the start they made and who could have predicted it because they are both on how 41 am i right which is the most any player has ever scored in fpl in the first three weeks so its an anomaly i feel it will even not theyre still going to be great assets but theyre not going to score at this pace the entire season cant keep this famous famous last ws famous last theyre not going to get double digit hs every single week man im just going to cut all these courts keep going keep going but so as they regress a bit as is expected statistically then theyll come closer tow what bmer and saka i people are transferring out saka because theyve been disappointed with his points and hes been hes been scoring so i think our perception of how many points a player should get in three weeks have been totally skewed by haren and salah start okay very reasonable take sam i must say its i think if roles have come full circle here im the one whos no its okay if you want to fit both of them in but i think its also okay to go without one and spread try and spread the funds around because spammer itself is already like two me cheaper than salah and two can go a long way in your defense or upgrading your 50 morgan rogers to a 70 someone okay fair enough i included son just for argument sake but as i included him i just thought would i dont even want son like i had him for those first two weeks i was happy to get the hall against everton but i sold him immediately and i think not going to look back i thought spurs were bad against newcastle and suns just not hes not worth 10 i think spurs just as a whole doesnt look as impressive as his points would suggest it feels like theyve just c carried on where they left off last season some good moments but then one pass through the defense and then all just falls apart doesnt seem like they progressed in any way yep agreed okay so as we ge up to your wild card reveal sam because at the end of this were going to show your mind blowing wild card so stay tuned for that like like this will change everything so lets lets talk about fixtures so we can try and figure out where you got to on your wild card biggest target here for you is what i dont know brighton maybe i think in the immediate next two games no team has it better than brighton thats what two home games against it switch against forest doesnt get any better than that so which brighton assets are we talking welbeck pedro min h i have stats from fb ref so the brighton player with the most go involement is mtoa who is in my team i wi for m very well balanced 10 xg 10 xa a nice 20 goal involvement one goal and assist already so far so everything looks out well right one xc one goal one xa one assist balance as all things should be now m is not that far behind and hes hes one whole meal cheaper so if you i inclined to go that way and theres been a lot of talk on how they are weak on his side right because li davis is very attacking so they tend to leave space there space that me can very well exploit so hes not that far behind only 18 expected gold involvement which is good more xa than xg though which is why it went for m i think yes i feel mto has a higher ceiling and possibly more nailed to play throughout the whole match i think fair and then behind him you have well back you have j pedro well at 16 and jed is down at one so those are the four options i think you look for in the team im happy with mtoa i think its a big differential as well not many people have gone mtoa so im im happy with mtoa i think a lot of people just cant make the especially people want to have both hala and salah so thats your benefit if youre going to go without one of the premiums you can afford moma over m talk to me about welbeck and pedro because i went pedro just okay that i must say i went with the template pick right hes boring hes on pens but i he does play deep and if youre going in this week hes in the brazil squad late call up which is annoying so if youre on wild cut this week do you not gamble with welbeck i think its a tough decision because wellb has shown we the good thing of wellbank is we have loads of data from his past seasons and he shown that he cant keep this he cant keep sc like this hell be good in bates hes not going to score 10 goals i think hes never scored more than 12 goals in a season like that right maybe lower i cant remember whats the stat so j pedro would be a safer pick long term mostly because of pants and if im not mistaken last week he played 90 minutes so his play seems even more secure than it should be of course of course this week in particular hes a risk may come on late may not play at all may start we dont know but over a long term i think xiao pedro would be the better pick over wellbe so if i were to w cut and i wanted brightons forward i would still go ja pedro and just take the risk he might come on in the last 20 minutes which possible that he can still score coming on and just take the socalled hit this week take that city but then be secured for the next few weeks i think in the priz bracket there are no other forwards better than both of them and i would pick pedro over wellbe in the long like for season i think your kid heard you talking danny welbeck and said no this got to stop man united legend arsenal legend danny welbeck although i did check you are right never brighton legend hes never scored 10 goals in a season thats crazy because hes so injury pro his highest nine three times with united but one thing about wellbe and you talked about price ranges why not just have both on wild card i know yes it sounds crazy double brighton attack why but theyre both 57 you have no decent forwards under six you barely have any decent forwards above six right people have adam armstrong okay chris wood being the exception chriswood worldclass player im surpassing all expectations if you can bench chris wood then chriswood is the guy to have at wild cut because forest fixture still look great right and first choice but why not just have welbeck and pedro run with it for a few weeks good fixtures whats the big deal here 57m rather than people like you sam i know youre going to be cheap and put a 45m forward on your bench whos never going to play and so youre exactly and so youre one injury away from being in trouble why not 12m dont tell me you dont have 12m are you saying to play one and bench one no just have both for these next two play both and at the end of that process play 3 43 because what i feel about welbeck is we are doing that classic thing of you and i we have seen welbeck we know who welbeck is therefore were not going to go for him because we know too much but i spoke to my so my brotherinlaw is the most casual person thats ever lived and talk is i got well back hes scoring points right so i got well back and the average fpl dude is just going to be like this dude scoring goals hes getting minutes he is well played what almost 90 minutes in gaming two hes not fluking these goals so and hes 57 when it goes wrong you dont care because theres nobody at his price whos doing this anyway so just have him and treat him as your eighth attacker its possible the argument then would be when you go for a 556 s midfielder versus a well back so its es esr and play 352 versus well back and play 343 exactly arent were talking about how brittle welbeck is no offense i love smith row but all these assle players are made of glass anyway so its if its between welbeck and smith r surely back is comparable no maybe most people are just worried about having two players from the same team who are not if theyre not a big team but thats not how you should think about these things right its not about they individually decent assets on their own you dont care whether you have two of the same team fa i appreciate your point sa its just it just feels wrong to both them it just feels so wrong but perhaps so wrong that right and i think once again i think this is a classic case of people have never watched brighton this season danny wel is playing number nine ja pedros playing number 10 if this were any other team youd be talking about the forward but because we are all fpl people who have played for so many years we know who welbeck is were like im never going to want danny welbeck i would never go near him and i dont think thats i think that is not how you look at this youre bringing your pass buers into it maybe which is why i went me over all of them i dont trust other guys i trust m japan jersey on for him today fair fa fair okay okay so speaking of less templ picks i want to try and put something crazy to you sam because i feel like no ones taking me seriously on this so maybe i can try and convince you because im in the market for a forward and ive been looking at somebody who has scored during the during the international break he plays a promoted team this week weak very leaky defense hes nailed to start very good on xg like i think he had point8 xg last in game week three i like him affordable all the good things that i know who youre talking about so i me who am i talking about can you give me a joshua zi josh zi so i dont get why i feel like the all the push back on joshua z because again too many content creators all fans and so they bring in all this or this is the worst club ever because you all lost the game which you were always going to lose anyway which to be fair im going to push a little bit of united agenda here but i felt that the loss the score line was worse than how it looked we had we just did not have salah at the end of those chances we had rash you had zy and zuky which comes back to my point i he did well over the international break im op cautiously optimistic for uniteds prospects over the next few weeks but i feel the best asset you the best united asset to have which i already said last week is alejandro gacho not even nailed mate zi is safer than this guy no gacho will start hes in my team this team i respect you sam but gachu would be lucky to reach southampton in time for this fixture he will play hes our best attacker i think d can see that now hes second highest in x spector involvement highest in xg despite only starting one game 14 xg so all the stats all the signs the it test the stats all points towards alejandro gacho im so not feeling this okay ill ill let you have your gacho thing if hes minutes to a nailed i would be more interested i dont think hes minil i dont know why he seems to like giving dio starts and mixing it with rashford but humor me on zi because i feel like people are missing out here you have a nailed forward 90 minutes against i think we all agree southampton is the worst team in the league right mh theyve got this kami kazi where defending where they just pass it around their box until somebody takes it from them and scores and i think j zi yes hes had misses but again we like forward to get to scoring positions right we dont mind if they miss a few chances hes not had preseason so hes not sharp but as you saw in international break very good improvised finish i think thats confidence right he scores a backwards header which m seems impressive to me southampton palace spurs three decent enough fixtures if you have to hold 7 mil whats whats the big deal here why are people so reluctant i would rather have other players than zi name i think thats the argument at 70 i would rather have well back i would rather have wha despite the bad fixtures you dont want wi city mate come on lets be real i think i dont think brenford are going to win but can they score one possible against city has an exactly look water typ but if youre not talking about just this one fixture talking about the next five fixture oriv i just dont have confidence in united but perhaps united bias you can say that sure but ive said it i said it last week as well the only player i see for united that worth having is g im just not keen on the rest okay all right i talk to me about bruno because a lot of people are considering selling bruno this week for salah so how do you feel about that i did the same thing on my wild cut of course but scored international break is he not back i think gacho is better if youre going to have one thats my argument the fixture look looks good i can see points coming from here im not saying hes going to blank although he probably will im just saying that i think ghu is a better asset to have so if youre on wild card and you have you have the opportunity to shift your funds around i would take the savings i get by getting gacho instead and then use the extra money somewhere else youre going to tell me that the guy whos not nailed to start whos in argentina to day is better than the guy who is nailed to start will play 90 minutes and is on penalties yes that is what im saying saa take it from united fan and i would think a lot of united fans would echo this sentiment that gacho looks like our most dangerous player and therefore the biggest source of points no i think i think a lot of united fans want gacha to be their most dangerous player because they look they watch him play and think this guy is so exciting why we arent we playing him every game and for 90 minutes but your where your it all falls down is your manager is a ball guy whos boring and hes not gna play gacho every week he will play bruno every week he will keep bruno on for the most of the game and bruno is the guy on penalties and im surprised sam because you had bruno to start the season and i feel like this is surviv what is it survivors bias survivors trauma i dont know ptsd because youve owned him for his blanks which we all agree have been unlucky you are now not going to own him for his points and i can already picture you coming back in game five to tell me i sold bruno just before his 17p point hall its possible although he hasnt had a big point hall for some time but sur even last season right i his points has been more spread he hasnt been the bruno as when he first came with a very high ceiling and scoring every game by the way saa its not just it test okay or not just united wishing the stats say that gacho is almost dangerous player so he is he is like that is the fact now his nness is an issue is a point of concern if you dont want to go gacho because youre worried that he might not start then thats a valid point but dont come and tell me that hes not our most dangerous player he has the highest of second highest expected goal involement but think a lot less minutes so if you account for the minutes then he is definitely well according to fb ref if i count for the minutes play our most dous play is anthony who created 01 xg in one minute of play so he expected going bolman per minute is through the roof but below him is gacho so i will stand ill stand by it that gano is the best united asset to have okay we spent too much time talking about a mtable team lets try and move on other teams are wild cart sam that you are looking at villa is tricky because they have such a nice run of fixtures but everyone its traumatized because bailey hasnt returned watkins hasnt returned morgan rogers has not returned thats say they all link to each other right if walkins has scor morgan rogers have written so we have got an assist i am half tempted to go for watkins in this fixure r because if you apply that same logic to bruno saa hes just unlucky its the same for wkins right now hes not nailed he should be nailed he came off early in the last game but its watkins and his villa right he theres no way that hell be dropped probably just still building up fitness i know youre looking at me just why is it because john duran has scor like how can watkins possibly be nail for the guy who comes on and scores within 10 seconds but its watkins come on perhaps again this is fast biases perhaps a part of me wants to take that risk because his xg has been great 16 xg ific one of the highest in the league aside from a few super humans like hen salah amongst humans sure amongst humans one of the highest although yon visa is doing well as well but anyway still point is hes getting into good position cs has not been scoring if he gets back to his old self you could see him scoring quite a lot of points in this this fixture run four very nice fixtures everton woles at home one game away against iswitch and then another home game against united away against fulham home game against bonth like those are all very scorable fixtures i like the watkins pi more than the gacha one i think i can grant you i think watkins as you say unlucky and even though his minutes have been bad this is a good week because duran is again in colombia and they come back later so if watkins was ever going to get 90 and watkins didnt go with away with england right he stayed back so this is as good a chance as any need to try and get 90 minutes and everton suck so i thats a good differential i think because start the season i think a lot of people had watkins but most people have sold him already by now so i dont mind the watkins move as much you take it because you and i suspect this is a byproduct of you having so much cash morgan rogers is not in your consideration its not because i dont need a 50 enabler but if you do i think he still the best option in that price range underlying stats have been poor but im im p to keep i feel i scored for the under 21s yesterday two goals you i feel like its coming you just want you want to be patient i think if he comes for walkins then he will come for rogers right its all linked so either way we cant lose okay so villa aside villa defend is nothing much to talk about either youll flip a coin between pow and conza youre not going anywhere right even then they havent been solid defensively so you might want one just for the fixtures and because its skip and maybe just put on the bench if you have three other starting defenders okay fair any other teams worth speaking about i think thats it right team wise fixture wise at least e lets talk about a for a bit right i be interested to know if he makes your wild card team go 69 now so cheaper and palace have had a strong end to the window i feel like theyve remedied a lot of the issues as was brilliant against chelse see so not tempted but there are only so few midfield slots he would be my i dont know sixth or seventh best midfield pick i would say again because youve got the budget right so youre not tempted by 69 ill go g over inexplicable gh love i just hope ten hog feels it as much as you do mate in terms of for those who dont have your funds okay you didnt seem sold on nicholas jackson so i wont push that with you but back to a though i just want to say that if you do have a he is definitely a longterm ho i know quite a few people sold him after the first two weeks only for him to return but maybe again past bias maybe but you could also consider history as data right and the data has shown that hes his points are usually spread out over a long period of time hes not a streaky player return like in big points in five games or three games so thing right so points will be spread out but its definitely a good asset to have thats for sure i think if i was going on a wild card again this week i definitely just have embo and a and just like leave them there season keepers similar prices on pant talisman you dont ever think about it again the bs a tough one because brenford has they have city away this week and then spurs away as well so two tough away games so if youre on wild cut like me im this decision has been hard for me do i just keep amo despite the two tough fixtures to save me from a transfer in later on because then they have two nice home fixtures i think longterm is a good pick its just can i do that the hokey pokei out in maybe mtoa for the next two fixtures and then transfer in foro just playing the fixtures thing or is it not worth the trouble and then just leaving in them there so that is a debate that im having i still dont have an answer for that s also consideration is because you got him in at seven both of us did right and now hes up to 71 which and that makes a difference we had two questions about in bore basic and ths 798 asking walk out questions b do you go saka and wisa or harvon and bore i have harton and bomo but i think in view of the ard injury id just say drop the arsenal attackers completely on wot and i wouldnt mind getting embo and wia again huh interesting z and they have the exact same fixtures in the next two yep true so if you take fixture out the equation pure points potential che you think so no if you were set on having one from each team i dont know man i think you just find the budget and get saka and saka ando you forward slot if they want answer the questions if you had to pick one of the two options its very disingenous because i have havs and wia but today if you ask me ill pick saka and b just saka wia for the fact that saks role is safer and even though i think harvard is much better as a nine i think the odard injury forces him back into midfield whereas saka will still play wherever he plays and will just be a safer pick fair i think plus umo has been doing well stats wise sorry umo wia has been doing well sawi so and ultimately no tony right so that helps with so much okay im with you im with you with a question from ignatius finishing up with terms of fixtures bowen and a 45 defender or trent and a 5m mid tren and rogers versus j even talk about west ham oren does that feel unfair maybe i think their fixtures has not turned enough yet for us to fully consider although bowen has been quietly doing the business right as expected i think i did shout out jared bowen a few weeks back i predict him to have a good season scor g no he didnt score in gimick one he scored gimick two assist in game three so two go involement in the past three games and one of them was against city i think bowen will be a good asset to have he only 75 its just finding that point to jump in wheres that the nice entry point because there are so many other midfielders you can get for example we already mentioned brighton next two fixures definitely better than west ham who so the next two fures fullam away chelsea home then brenford away also a pretty tough fixture so where is that nice jumping on point you have to decide that yourself but in a vacuum j great asset i would love to have jo my team so i think is just a safer pick than a lot of these 7m mids right and probably even you can even say 8m ms but lets wrap up wild cart chat about liverpool cuz thats going to be hardest decision this week surely you are tempted i know logically lot of people are saying trent robo salah safe boring what youre getting liverpool havent conceded a goal yet so look solid i can see from your eye youre not sold im not so on double liverpool defense because i think they have been you going to say somewhat lucky somewhat lucky to have kept three cle sheets back to back because they have been conceding chances especially against united they considered an x of 13 so they were lucky in that sense that united was just so bad at finishing uniteds a good team buddy surprising to as it may be to united fans see again i feel like youre mentally downgrading this no united is a good team theyve been playing well in fact i think that we played aside from the mistakes we play as well as liverpool we just the players were failing at the final we at the final ball so its getting the ball to r and seeing what he does versus getting the ball to salah and seeing what he does one results in a goal one results in a mis chance but do you not so okay so fair right so united a good team and therefore xg being put up against liverpools right whereas now lipol play what forest bou wolves palace could probably keep for clean sheets back to back i dont know first of all thats chris wood i dont see a clinch in that match now what im saying is that i dont think they are the best defensive team in the league despite the fact that the only want who kep cle three clean sheets again very small sample size how many times in f have we seena in history that i think he clean three clean sheits in a row and then proceeds to not clean she for the next 10 very possible but i say this time fixtures right were not just banking on them being a good defense per se so i would get one of tren and robo i think two getting both of is just too much money spending in like robertson six you could get m in midfield i would be fairly confident that m can match or maybe has a higher ceiling over the next two games in particular i like how you lost confidence in that sentence okay so i will go two forwards cuz i think liverpool will look much more exciting attacking wise rather than defensively so i will go for two liverpool attackers and one defender i like yes but it does concern me that hes flying back so late and the fact they have capable replacements so and the fact that he keeps getting subed off no like this man has no respect for hatrick rules he just keeps taking him off so its been i think a few people have spoke about the fact that he likes to bring off his wingers and so far weve seen that its true he does he does like to bring off his wingers at 60 70 minutes he does seem to be the one benefiting the most from of course two goals against united so maybe that skewes it a bit i think theres very little to separate between jot and ds so im happy still keeping j in the team although if you were in cl to go ds i think its a good option as well dont dont dont give me that answer pick one gun youre on w no youre on wut m you got to pick one so who you going with j okay so purely because of colombia i think so yes okay let me bring up the stats and lets see who has been getting more xt and stuff like that almost dead even i ive already looked at this okay so 18 xt diaz 18 jota 16 so close not much to separate between them all right fair i think what helps jot is replacement is da and yunes and dss replacement is gakpo and i think i know which one i would rather which i dont know i think d is definitely not slots favorite player i think i think the early indications would suggest that okay i think slot wants less chaos and he wants a lot more control thats true thats a good point i think he wants a control to press he doesnt like this thing where i think da and bruno some of these guys like to press without just like hold the r2 button and run around a lot slots a bit more measured okay fair okay all right i think weve spent a lot of time lets lets go to the reveal i was going to do this like position by position but lifes too short lets lets lets crack on right this is y wka team as of yesterday so presumably this is 10 drafts ago already out of ive only changed one play in the no in the my wild cut team okay lets introduce it for the podcast listeners first okay so you got rya and go anthony robinson trent lewis in midfield you got jot salah embo mtoa palmer up top you have isak and bench of 40 keeper coner greaves and a 45 forward who no longer plays in the premier league so talk to me i still think rya is worth getting purely a long term because you can do the hok ki with your other positions but keeper is one that i think you just get one that youre happy to leave long term rya is the cheapest arsenal defender that you can get arsenal still one of the best defensive teams in the premier league maybe the yes so right at this i dont see saliva and gabrielle outscoring him that much that proves worth the outlay the trend sorry go ahead with the injuries right to rise guard i think this just makes ara way more defensive already were quite defensive team we have five center backs six center backs each is going to be more defensive so i think we discussed this at start of the season aral and tough fix is not a bad idea for defense because they will play for in and take it quite happily mhm so tren dont i dont think you need to explain tren robinson as well the best five 45 is he still 45 46 now 46 the best defended g that range zero clean shits sary game like that so its fine its fine for 45 we talked about louw has to be in your team i think if people who dont want him youre scared of one occasional benching youll be my guest mate but this guys levels pep just is going to keep saying it every week best player ive ever seen my god hes amazing just accept it and if youre on wild card just make sure you have a good bench so i have coner on my bench so if l gets dropped cons comes in thats fine right im happy with that so thats the benefit of being on wild cut midfield again dont need to explain j salah we already talked about it again i already talked about me tom im still thinking umo so ive changed umo to gacho in my actual one that i have not sent to use but im not 100 sold on that because again i definitely will wanto in so this is just purely a fixture play mtoa next to moves too do we want to plan in a transfer like that or should we just leave him in and save those transfers im still debating on that and the debate will probably go on all the way to deadline so dont have an answer for your listeners same with palmer as well with a brandley carrying a minor knock although fix just look good so i probably will still keep palmer in the team harvards is a point of debate as well so like we discussed earlier with the injury to ard how much of that will affect ive seen some talk that he might be moved deeper hav it to accommodate for other got cuz you dont do you have another player i think fab via is out who used to be the replacement right out on loan so you dont have an am to fit to play in ards position but nobody exactly im a bit put off by havitz you can take him out and then again youre doing the hok ki but then two weeks later when they have good fixtures od theat probably will be back by then hopefully rise as well then you can bring your arsenal players back in again you are planning transfers which i dont necessarily like because things never work out as it planed when it comes to transfers but its an option and isak im happy is im keeping isak again like i mentioned last week he returns when hes fit if hes fit have isak i think isach im fine with this is my question to you and this is see you dont have harand but you have harvard and palmer and a non a team with harland would lose palmer probably for rogers and thats where the difference comes so i my question to you is what do you doing know because your harvards position is quite crucial because thats your big differentiating point from a salah team where what do you do because there arent that many good forwards in this game so like i mentioned watkins is an option although hes significantly more expensive so i will have to move some funds around here and there you could go down possibly you could go down drop har to a pedro well back like that its possible so the fun thing about not having highland is this challenge of okay because i dont have highland i need to spread it out how there are many combinations in which i can do it whereas if you have hland youre stuck like i need to have morgan rogers and thats it so it does makes it more fun in that sense i relented and got salah in because u i dont know i feel like you still you still can have fun with salah theres still enough money going around that i can i can have this nice debate throughout the week in my head should i get this pa this play is it worth it where if youre highland your so your team is stuck so im doing it purely for vipes definitely not the optimal way to play fpl lers do not follow what im doing say it properly its not its not a bad team like i said its probably just two players off a harand salah optimal team so and like you said you got way more flexibility so whereas i have next to no flexibility my transfer this week is going to be either m or welbeck and you are picking from the likes of moma and watkins so there are different there are levels to this and the idea is that over a longer fixture run yes the first three fixtures have been a disaster if you went without harland but over the cost of 10 games because you would expect your the likes of mtoa to outscore morgan rogers especially over a 10 game run right so then thats where the idea is thats when you see the value of going without harand so lets see lets see lets see how it goes okay all good points i think were done right sir yep i think so longer episode than i thought we would but its been its been good s your wild card was mildly interesting i must say i think its mild because its a its taking a lot of lets say balls to activate the biggest chip in the game and still not go with the guy who sc the most points debatable if he blanks this week youre youre in heaven right youre just betting on one guy to blank so you never know yep in the in the three weeks in a season where he blanks ill be on heaven 35 to be fair its not even blanking right you just youre fine if he scores one goal thats all you want just stop scoring hat tricks stop doing it every week colen okay all right okay so i think were done but well see you in time for game week five but in the meantime sir get your green arrows guys have a good week,9557

because we haven't had time to sound check but I think it's all good um that we sound good loud and clear says Derek NOS hello Derek thank you for joining us n the karbers Sals is camera out is quite the you no honestly it was Nigel um did you win B mark on the toilet this time yeah I no I went in yeah I I used porcelain for sure no one will know what you're talking about there is definitely context needed but I'm not even gonna say it so no you know there's 783 watching I think the the more technical issues we have the greater the audience way yeah yeah it's always been way yeah sorry we're um 35 minutes late and two hours later than the normal time of 7 but you know we're here it's fun you got beer as well we are I've got a beer we've got lots to talk about guns out is the title of the show uh because obviously everyone selling sacker odard injury Dean rice is out um there's definitely a tide a tial wave of people moving off their Arsenal assets and I think I'm sharing the Airways with one here aren't I as you doing you are indeed and I'm I'm seeing the moves I'm planning loads of people are making making those moves now some people making them for for hits I don't feel good about them at all so I'm surprised so many people are are thinking about um sacker and isach out I'm I'm really nervous nervous about it I've already made one of the two moves so no going back now you know how it goes right you know you know in fbl one of the unwritten rules is when when a large section of of the community go with a particular opinion yeah and that opinion could be a slid IND doors crosss whatever it is you know what happens next right normally it normally blows up in our face doesn't it any any Mass decision like this that's gone well I no exactly exactly very rarely does it go called into plan um which um you know it's disconcerting for me because I'm going to end up cing sellah so if people who are selling sacka getting sah and that doesn't work out then it's still gonna hurt me because I'm probably end up Captain so there'll be some pain this side as if it does go wrong um flanny boy 1888 thank you so much for the uh Super Chat already we will get to Super chats at the end we'll probably be here till 10 to midnight or even later than that but um that's all good you know we do it that's the kind of thing we do um right let's let's get on with some stuff shall we uh but before we do we better have a word from our sponsors and my word we earn those sponsors yes oh yes well everyone by now will be familiar with with sleeper I think you know obviously a lot of content creators talking about it um a lot of people getting involved in the in the pickham league and we had our first winner um from that and a PlayStation 5 we'll be going to our monthly winner of the of the pickham uh League me and you Mark or you and I I should say took part in our first ever blackbox draft it was fun it really good yeah I loved it um it was like uh yeah it kind of revived memories of the old days um I obviously we were running the team together there was a little bit of two and thr between us you you were nay saying my picks but I think in the end we we basically got a team of 15 seven of which are all injured or suspended but you know yeah I mean our team is Palmer salanki Diaz kuna Rea Romero aangi and Bailey then it starts getting a little bit Suspect with rice caori such Anderson kadogo cliver honana and Alex Moreno but everyone's in the same boat the first sort of eight or nine picks were fine and then it was a bit um yeah it got a bit ropey after that I think we're in a pretty good pretty good position against the others I I think so once we get K Galo play in and califur I can't why have we got why have we got these players I can't pronounce you idiot um once we get them back from injury any players it would have really limited us we were that was our policy yeah that's absolutely true um yeah so yeah I'm gonna love doing that and um I'm looking forward to it really looking forward and the sleeper app was good the interface was good it didn't crash no issues very smooth experience so get involved get involved if you fancy having a that is the message yeah get involved uh try out the draft use the um QR code on the screen give that a scan uh you know just just give it go let us know what you think think of it I thought it was a great um I thought it was a great great interface and and the draft was fun and yeah anyone asking where they can watch it there are I'm hoping there's going to be more Clips like the ones they posted um coming soon so yeah if not we'll publish the whole thing arguments and the bit the bit when GI kept signing injured players and we were like it would you say he's gonna need a good physio or something like that yeah no I said he's goingon to need Jesus Christ as a physio to revive them from the dead Bailey is injured I know David yes Bailey is injured we we have picked some injured players as well but we haven't got Reese James how have we got on and Alex Moreno all right that be fine right fbl let's get on to that sh we uh let's look at our game weeks first of all shall we uh you did all right you know yeah 73 got some points from Henderson finally four points for him Trent porro and Robinson another assist from Robinson he's he's done right in the first in the first few weeks pretty happy that for four five uh jotter Gordon and Rogers that was all a bit of a disaster one assist from sacka nothing from the other three uh attackers despite all you know all scoring goals nothing from jot is really disappointing when de's got the brace and Salah got what 17p pointer um so yeah that was that was annoying uh harand and isach harand with a hattick captain basically carrying the team as usual isach with the goal he's been unceremoniously shipped out after his uh after his first goal of the season and beta who's blanked twice since I bought him in um now has massive threat um you know from from other signings they've made and I'm a bit worried about him and nothing much on the bench it was an okay week but yeah like one one player scoring over 10 and that was harland's Captain the rest is pretty average what you make it J because obviously um we had high expectations when we learn he'd start the season down the middle um but Diaz has been the one of the of the two S5s to come out and and and hit with big points so far J the right week one but I don't know he he does seem to be dropping deeper and letting Salah and Diaz be the ones that tuck in is that your impression yeah I mean next year I have .08 in that Manchester United game which obviously isn't ideal but 0.99 and 0.65 in the games before um and you know had had a goal and assist in though so going into the the game against manchest United I was pretty pretty conf he was going to get something and you know when the score goes to 3-0 you think he's going to be involved in some capacity but I think it's just going to be one of those is I think salah's just obviously going to consistently score points and then the other you know i' put sabosa into that bracket as well probably not as high as Diaz and J but I think they're all just going to have weeks where they score well score weeks where they don't and you can keep trying to chase it and getting Diaz but I think you just pick one and kind of stick with them and until jot loses his places I'll be I'll be sticking with him um people requesting to see how ranks I'll get I there we go they're under our names there and while they're fairly decent we'll keep them head with Noland yeah well more than that in a minute let's get to my team and go through that no Harland of course uh it was ryer two points Lewis six Trent six coner two Smith ow2 son just the three sacka Captain which was a big disappoint that in a minute Salah 17 Rogers two isach nine and wiissa who was my transfer coming in with goal and bonus um yeah 69 not great obviously didn't have Harland Captain the wrong player um and I will point out the fact that I've captain in Salah only once and got a double figure return in match of the Day game week two of Captain e gameweek one and sacka game week three what have they got in common they're both playing teams at a man sent off so on both occasions when I picked the captain other than Salah the teams I've captained a player in have been reduced to 10 men with rightfully 45 minutes to go rightfully sent off come on dear me yeah it was um it's frustrating because I think I mean saaka sh still should have got more points because he had a chance right at the end and he was oh heavily involved was I mean he had had hint you on toes didn't he in the first sort of 15 20 minutes it was very concerning um and then we started to play a bit better for I don't know it was a it was a evish game but Arsenal will feel like they should have won that especially towards the end like you say I thought I thought that was in I thought Saka was just going to bury that and it was gonna break some hearts great result for Brighton Arsenal should have won it but Brighton good account of themselves again yeah and I was disappointed with son because I really did think Spurs would get something at Newcastle um and they played well did okay uh but Newcastle kind of grounded out the result didn't they and Spurs again um liking game week one at Leicester away from home just couldn't convert their play into chances and goals and yeah some hanging on this week I don't know whether he'll go it doesn't look like it looks like I'm going to make another change but more on that at the end but wha was great I mean hoped for turn got one now he's going to be on my bench for a few game weeks until brenford run starts in game week six onwards and that's where hopefully he'll come into his own but I've noticed a lot of content creators talking about him now so good to get to him early the original the original and of course we know how it works because I got him first no one else is allowed to have him that's that's exactly the way it works right should want him it's like last season so once you get some points from him he's dead to me I'm never I'm never getting this now ever good brilliant that's that's that's fine uh let's look at Great and the good and see where we stand in that let's go this is why we have to drink the cams Harry's gone top of that Harry how does he doing yeah it's crazy isn't it because um I think he's got Salah and harand right like prazz so obviously Salah and harand teams have done very well at the start of the season and perhaps the shortcomings of going Salah and Harland don't reveal themselves over a short spell it's going to take longer so that's that's my reasoning as to why I haven't got Sal yeah but obviously you know Salah pra and and Harry have done started the season really well n 1,996 or 196,000 for Harry PR 2016 216,000 rather general just behind them and then Fran uh 584 just above me Luke's in between we've got a we got a disabled sandwich between uh between us as Luke is between us disabled just to make that clear he his he his online name good clarification yes and then Andy coming up behind you so to speak um it's all very close all very close I would just say Harry hasn't got Salah he's he's Harland was he not no he is he is Harland only um he has got the mighty chriswood though which explain will be will be happy with his nine points and E kept to favor of e as well which again just shows patience with players good good line numbers eventually they'll they'll come good so yeah um yeah it's nice we're we're we're not in the bottom the you know we're not in the trenches at the moment both in the top million I'll take that yeah yeah qualifying for Europe at the moment in the great the good which is fine we'll keep going on that um let's look at uh start looking at some data then team defense um so this is obviously caveat fre fre game weeks small sample etc etc um but you know we're looking for Trends we're looking for trends that could continue uh one thing that's unlikely to continue I'd imagine is noton Forest being the second best defense in the Premier League but um there they are at the top but of course as you see fixture difficulties yeah they had they've had the best start to the season with their first three fixtures City at the top low and um seven chances per 90 conceded the best of any team here um and what's interesting is you know one we expect City to stay in the top two uh the second Point that's interesting is Arsenal who have kept three clean sheets and well two clean sheets and were keeping one until Brighton scored and they reduced to 10 men down in seventh you know we' have thought Arsenal would be in the top two or three defenses but they're not and they're actually conceded in 14 chances per 90 which is quite a lot considering their reputation going into the season as the strongest defense well it's not a broken record but they were lucky to not concede to cabia in gameweek one and they were I don't even what you'd call it how they didn't concede toy Watkins in in game week two um and yeah like I said they they were in they were in good control of of that game um limiting Brighton to to a few chances the red card kind of changed things we had a really really good spell um when just after that red card which it's quite natural and then they started coming towards the end but luckily we managed to actually score in that in that spell where we were dominating um a bit more but yeah I mean it's it's obviously we're going to be talking about the ramifications of of odard being out havs having to drop back into into Midfield um obviously they've got lots of defensive options Timber came in um but califur is he got a knock or is he pushing he got knock an international break yeah yeah I thought so um but I mean that doesn't really change the makeup of it I mean are they going to adopt a more defensive approach now they've lost because they've lost odard and they've lost their kind of main Striker because hav is gonna have to drop back to Midfield you see hav dropping back and well no jeesus um could return um so we we'll need to get our Teta team news but the last we heard about jezus is following the international break he might have a chance so he could be back in the frame you see it then as tral out front hav dropping back do you to take OD guard's plays in Midfield probably probably because I mean who do they bring into midfield if if they keep habits up top do they bring yeah two Stoppers wouldn't they it's part still there yeah yeah he started the season yeah so if they bring him in then that's good news for the defensive but not so good news for zaka presumably um mourinho's still out isn't he so they can't they can't bring him in um yeah I don't know I think it's it's one of the reasons I mean it's been an up and down International game with with the transfers I've been looking to make you know debating whether to take sacker out or not now I've landed on sacker out and I think this news pushes me into that because I don't think it's going to affect their defense very much but really if you've got reyya CA Gabrielle you're probably not expecting a clean sheet in the next two games against Spurs and City anyway oh yeah but it has to yeah I mean I've in my predictions I've said that Spurs will score um I agree with you I think that I don't I don't think in O odard I mean we're going to look up I've got some charts and tables on odard later on in the show that we'll get to I me look at midfielders but I don't think it changes Arsenal's approach to the game um in that they are I think by their very nature defensively sound in every game they go into I don't think they go into any game um you know going all out attack they are first and foremost Resolute and then they've got quality up top to to score goals but they're not going to win games 5 six nil they they've become almost what city have become which is a side that can get results but never really takes the handbreak off and manages games out that's what they've become it's a results machine and it's no surprise that artet has followed the same path that Pep's done with with City in that respect you know of the teams at the top that are full on attack you'd have to say it was Liverpool under clop whether it is Liverpool under slot so far you'd say yes they they're the team who will go full thr and score goals but that could be changing as well Liverpool are third in this table defensively and I don't think it's a long stretch even after three games to say that we're seeing Liverpool change and they're actually now a team that are more pragmatic and defensive do you do you feel that yeah I mean there's not many managers is there that have come in and and and kept free clean sheets in the first in the first three games um I'm yeah I've been really impressive I've rewatched the the highlights of the the Liverpool Manchester United game and you know they're just leagues apart in terms of organization everything I mean it's going to be really yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really interesting know what what slot does with Trent um because there are some rumors going around aren't there that he's not totally happy with him there's always been question marks around his defensive ability well if slot wants to turn Liverpool into a more pragmatic and defensive unit what does that mean for for Trent because you could argue that he's a bit of a liability defensively but obviously makes up for it with attacking play but yeah I I don't think I don't think Liverpool are getting turned into a defensive side I'll take that back but it's more about control it's and which is what city and Arsenal are about it's about controlling the game managing the game and the result being primarily the goal rather than we're going to go all out and play like the heavy metal football that klopp used to play I think we're seeing the dial move back some notches from that they're still scoring goals but what we are seeing is suddenly rather than just being arsenal were the only team we can invest in defense for defense suddenly City are Reviving it seems maybe maybe it's too early to say but maybe City are going to be that strong defensive unit again that we can go to you know who knows who we end up picking viio or Lewis probably but Liverpool are now in that bracket as well so far it would say yeah and there are ways that we can tap into it with potentially Allison Robertson's really popular over over the break as well I've noticed there's a lot of AI recommendations for for Robertson uh going in I mean the the difficulty with that is obviously you have to then sacrifice potentially going for I mean assuming Trent and Salah are in your side you're basically having to choose between a Diaz jota or a or a Robertson and I still favor the the attack I think with the fixures the way they are but Robertson has presented himself as a as an interesting option going going forward um but yeah it's and the other and obviously the other really interesting thing is what's going with coner and canate like is canate just starting every week now because then he's an option as well I don't want to get into that because people are buy C conon their drugs and blame me for that but yeah I I I think when Europe starts we know game week four onwards that's going to answer some questions isn't it on that front um just wanted to mention and Villa defenses here they are fourth and fifth in the table the table obviously is sorted by XG conceded non penalty per 90 and we've got City top 0.68 forest second 0.70 then Liverpool 0.79 bit of a gap to Villa on 1.0 and then Chelsea 1.09 I I mentioned Villa and Chelsea because in terms of fixture difficulty they've had a a tougher start in the top three so therefore perhaps and again early days perhaps Villa and Chelsea could turn into sides that we can look at I think probably in that second tier below City Liverpool and Arsenal but perhaps Villa and Chelsea could be the teams we go to for some value in defense yeah the difficulty with vill obviously the champions league is going to start and how they're going to deal with with that with all the games that they've got to to play I mean coner is obviously really popular you've got him not K quansa the other one the K coner uh but people saw the kind of hard part of that and the reason why he got less than 100 points last season despite playing most of the game is just Villa concede stupid goals and concede goals you know and even though the stats are the underlying stats are good I still don't really trust them um in that area you lose that attacking threat that you get with with someone like Robinson for example at four five but the fixtures are nice so you are going to want to play him I just yeah I mean I'd still favor coner to like Co will though at four or five I I trust Chelsea even even less the teams just seem to be able to get at them and I'm really surprised to see them at fifth on list they seem to get carved open quite quite easily but the underlying stats aren't really supporting that no I mean 10.67 chance he's considered P90 the same as Villa um so so far we haven't seen that middle in defense emerge we're still waiting to see who it is and when we're going to get to Defenders we can see we know there's value with Robinson at Fulham and porro at Spurs or maybe Romero at Spurs what's interesting here wolves are 1.32 with some really tough fixtures they might be worth look and there's a name I want to pick out when we get to Defenders who could be a Target when the fixtures improve Brighton Middle in defense at the moment in 10th do you expect them to climb that table because I I see you as a more defensive side you know since the Zerby left right yeah there's there's more of a plan I think to deal with there's a plan B when things aren't going well to to drop back and again I think we've got players who have already bought into the system and and there seems to be like quite a lot of cohesion in the way we attack and and the way we defend the issue is a little bit that Dunc is getting on a bit kadogo is going to come in um untested in the in the Premier League I mean he's got a great reputation people seem to absolutely love him but hasn't played in the Premier League yet we've got hinwood playing a a left back his Stan should come back but he's been a bit suspect you know defensively I don't know there's there's a bit of like change and a bit of you know amendments coming to to to the Brighton backline so would I expect immediate improvements on this probably not but I think it will settle down and we will become good good value I think the ver Bren and like fleen rotation if you're on a wild card just looks so good I was gonna the end of the season let's get to Keepers save that chat till Keepers um es ban mentioning con got not playing fing he did indeed and he went off I think on about 70 minutes didn't look too serious um he wasn't going off shaking his head or head in his hands or anything like that so we we do have to wait for the presser for memory um so we have to see we have to see whether coner is going to be ready for the weekend but yeah you mentioned the fixtures let's just bring up the the the fixtures for Villa this is the long ticker showing game weeks 4 to 12 and Villa are four in that um but if we look at the shortterm pictures Everton at home Wolves at home it's Swit away doesn't really get much better than that does it it doesn't but at the same time Everton were really really impressive against Bournemouth for literally 88 minutes you know Jack Harrison was looking good Cal L had a bit about him they were attacking really well um and to lose that game is is one of the biggest like throwaways I can I can remember because I was watching it a match of today and honestly Bournemouth didn't have a highlight until 88th minute there wasn't a single attack of not for Bournemouth and then there was like six highlights in a row all Bournemouth attacks every cross seemed to cause them problems it was absolute capitulation wasn't it compl um complete I watched some Everton fan pods afterwards cuz I wallowing in other team's misy and um they were just saying you could smell it you could smell it in the ground and like the the fear in the players the minute they got one goal and it's like yeah I've been there with Forest I I've seen it I mean I remember the Sheffield United semi F in the playoffs when they pulled one back and suddenly you could just sense that all the confidence was going it was only a matter of time for more goals to consider and that's how it was in that game five minutes was crazy it was such an undy like end to the match because you know the balls were coming in and there was players unmarked on the edge of the area like Everton had a breakaway and and they actually tried to attack and then Bournemouth won the ball back and pushed and Everton weren't bringing all their men back like hurridly to defend it wasn't like they were defending with 10 men behind the ball there was like massive pockets of space for for Bournemouth to attack D must have been I was gonna say tearing his hair out he he has got much of that but he must it's worrying he worrying what's going on at EV that's for sure um let's look at some attacking data um and some ofam I just going to say quickly there's there's that game and then it's Wolves and IP switch and although I think those games look amazing from an attacking perspective and you'd expect them to score lots of goals I still think from a defensive perspective Everton wolves nips switch isn't as easy as it as it might look on paper not when we're talking about yeah Derby factor and then the nip switch I think are are G to get him because I think um uh what's his name up top dap I can never remember dap's name dap up top is going to cause them isses yeah Lively and in it switch I think of all the promoted sides are the ones that are going to pose the biggest attacking threat we haven't seen it yet which brings me to the attacking date we haven't seen it yet and it switch bottom of this table for team dat attack XG non penalty per 90 .40 the reason why they're down there though is because they've had the toughest opening three fixtures I believe I do believe that we will see more from them but having said that you know 6.33 shots per 90 is woeful um but the fixtures have been against them so I am interested to see what they do now that the fixtures ease up for them somewhat um but yeah no surprise to see it switch and leester down the bottom s anonin 14th 1.16 more favorable but um I think of the three promoter sides it's which the one I'm looking at they they've signed some smart players I think and I think they've got you know Leaf Davis someone who I I said Leaf there um a player that could offer an option in defense uh in terms of attacking returns and I think they've got a sprinkling of talent including dap like you mentioned so I expect to see yeah halfway line drove and just banged it in I mean yeah great goal not what you'd expect from a a promoted Striker but obviously he was he was in the championship last season on loan part of the city graduates um so you expect him to be quality and he's starting to show it but I think it's which will climb this table I don't think they'll climb to the Heights and at the very top we see Liverpool there who are absolutely dominant what the stat that I pick out here although it's 2.37 non penalty per 90 it's the big chances over five big chances per game crazy that I mean that is massive um and obviously we're expecting that to Plateau a little bit but the next two fixtures are are good two home games um obviously forest with good underlying numbers but you'd still expect Liverpool to to you know to have chances in that game and then Bournemouth at home when when harland's away and I think that's what kind of taking me into the Realms of thinking I want to get Salah in because that Bournemouth at home game looks great when harland's got that that tricky match and then it's who do you Captain otherwise because if if I've just got Harland and sacka as my two premiums I don't really want to Captain either of them in in that match so then I'm either taking a punt on on someone else uh in in five um but there's no one I really trust at the moment or I go for go for sell yeah what we're talking about is the Liverpool Bank of Pies which starts now which is a group of four fixtures which we always wanted to Target Forest Bournemouth wolves away and then Palace away and the reason why that's of interest is because in the middle of that Harland plays Arsenal uh and then goes to Newcastle yeah and Newcastle away traditionally one of the hardest away games and he might find it difficult there I me all at the moment he's not finding anything too difficult but you got to say if you're comparing harand to C over this next four you would say that salah's got a good chance of outscoring harand right given that he's kept pace of himself so far yeah they got they've got identical points at the moment yeah 41 points I mean that is that is that is ridiculous I wasn't expecting that the main reason why I didn't go with him I thought I thought you know the points might be shared a bit more between Liverpool and it turns out they were just all getting them except for bloody J apparently Trent I mean how Trent hasn't got an attack in return yet I I don't know because that offside was I mean Salah didn't need to touch that did he um and then and then Trent's getting a double digit in that he could have had an assist in in the first game lot of what ifs and maybees but I think he's been genuinely really unlucky not to Not to Come Away with with more points but yeah you look at this St and think yeah with two home games to come and then wolves and then Palace I mean that isn't exactly a bad game the way Palace have started you want to be trebling up I think on Liverpool in in some capacity yeah I I think we you know I mentioned that Liverpool becoming maybe more pragmatic under slot but it's not detracting from their attack and data obviously it's been the perfect start you know three wins no goal was conceded um slot looks confident and we maybe questioned some of his methods in handling man management maybe with Trent in particular but there's no there's no question he's getting results and and Liverpool are that FB points machine we needed them to be um you know with harand so dominant it would have been a pretty tedious start to the season if Salah Haden have kept pace as he has because then you know we wouldn't be sitting here even deba whether we go harand because he would be absolutely dominating but the fact that Salah with a Liverpool team that looks like they're going to be scoring goals regularly Sal is a viable option which is what we need and now we need other players to join that we need we need son to step up when he sacker to step up to rival Holland otherwise you know we just don't want that one player dominating things do we yeah I'm still I'm still I did an article um for for sports casting which you can you can see on my Twitter which was I was looking if I was going to Wild Card this week what route would I go down would I go you know Salah only well no cuz I want I don't think I'll be wild carding out Harland uh right now would I go Harland only or would I go for for both and even though I'm thinking of getting both in my team this week doing that sacker and esack move I don't really like the idea of wild carding and having both just because when you look at what it does to the rest of your side you you're basically stuck having to play three five fives every week and okay those five fives are under aren't bad because I'm looking like Min Rogers and J Pedro for example they're not a bad three but you're kind of locked in to them so what happens if like a saos light emerges and you want to move and you need to find an extra million from somewhere or you want to get Robertson or you know Arsenal's you know um fixes turns soon you want to get an Arsenal Defender you want to get sacker it's it becomes very inflexible and things change very quickly in the next few weeks so I think I would still go for just Harland if I was walk carding this week and it's what put me off doing it in this in this PR Bas it's funny actually you changed your um your your profile image on Twitter and um it's thrown me completely because I saw this article on Twitter saying oh do you want to go Sal and harand I thought well that's handy I'll have a read of that and then I realized it was written by you and I was I haven't read it you're about to pay me oh that's the best no no don't don't think there was a compliment coming because yeah I mean I think I think the biggest thing for me when I look at teams that are and this is you know one of the the big topics at the moment is about you forgoing sacka to bring in Salah is it's the fact that Arsenal's fixtures although they're really tough over the spell we're looking at here from 4 to 12 they're like third from bottom on the ticker they've got Spurs and city next and that's what's dragging it down but there's also a bad run from gameweek nine 10 and 11 when they face Liverpool at home Newcastle away Chelsea away now you know that's a tough run but in between that sandwiched in between that is in game week six Leicester at home and in game week seven s an at home those are probably the two best home fixtures you can have and they get them back to back and even without odard there if he isn't back by then you'd still back Arsenal to score goals get clean sheets and so if you're moving away from Arsenal in order to get money for sa for Salah you've got that problem of gameweek six and seven haven't you well I think it pretty much locks me into a wild card in six right doing these moves which I don't think is is the worst thing in the world because I want to be able to take advantage of that fixure anyway and probably double up triple up on on Arsenal uh over that time but I can't be going into at the moment I've got no arsal Defender and I probably well I won't have sacker if I take him out for for Salah so how am I going to move back to those for six I'm not really going to be able to so I think that's that's going to be a wild card in in six for me if and when I go ahead with it because yeah I'm I'm going to go ahead with it yeah I I think yeah I without an Arsenal Defender I can absolutely see why doing it because you're you not only are you not going to have sacker you've got to get an Aral Defender as well for that for that run um I get it I think if you did have an arsal Defender though if you were in that situation would you be thinking twice about selling sacka because you kind of you are committing the Wild Card really aren't you yeah I mean if it's just one transfer you could in theory do Salah back to sacka and would you do that though when when salah's salah's going to wolves and Palace wolvves W that's it you're going to be selling Sal is is is away at wolves I mean if I Wild Card though it's probably going to be the same boat because like I said I'm probably not going to go with harand and Salah so then I getting rid of Salah away at away at wolves um and I mean he's he's cap he's probably the best Captain option that week isn't he because like you said harland's got Newcastle Newcastle away so maybe it's a case of holding off until seven to to walk C sell out um when he plays Palace away which it's still a pretty good fixture but it's not as you can catch in saaka surely are you not going to do that you're not going to catch inaka to Leicester yeah maybe I don't really trust zaka as a captain you're not don't know well you I mean you captained him and got six points yeah yeah I mean his ceiling does feel like it's lower than harand for sure I get that but he's a consistent points machine like I I have no doubt he will get returns in those two games whether he'll get double figures that's the big issue isn't it I guess I mean you'd expect him to get at least one I mean if he doesn't get one double digit Hall against leester and Southampton at home like you said there's two best fixtures you can have um it's going to be interesting period that because you're going to want all three of those players and yeah you you can do it but like I said you're you're you're going to be massively um low in other areas of your of your team so you're not thinking of wild card into that scenario I I will I'm not ruling it out but would I wild card into Salah har and sacka and Trent and then have to with all the all the low all the other Dr that I'm going to have to have in my my side um I mean that's not even take into account you know Palmer for example who's got Brighton at home in six and then then Forest at home in seven two home games for him he's incredible at home last season it's a it's a real dilemma it is and I think we're sitting here in game week three or four and it's like are we confident enough that we know the where the value is like you know we can get to midfielders in a bit and we look at um Min seeno there are players there that you think well they can at a 55 fulfill the role of enablers to to to get me to a place where I could get those big hitters in yeah but we we're only three game weeks in and so like you say someone could yet emerge as a major bandwagon that we want to move to and then you're you're cut off from making that without making multiple transfers obviously so it is it is early yeah well the other option is you don't go for sack and you go for um have yeah up top and and if you've got um isack for example well isack in six has got Man City so that feels like a good time to he then immediately goes into Everton off the back of that um but maybe that's you know if you can't move for for sack because you don't want to lose your your C and Harland maybe that's the way you you attack those those two because yeah up up to now havs has been outscoring sea so might not happen carry on happening but at the moment you could back you could have a go but not having sacker for Leicester and Southampton at home is a worry you're going to be especially after what I saw against Brian because like you said he could have hold in that he just sometimes finds a way not to get all the points that he he deserves um but what I will say is we're gonna touch on the impact that OD guard's absence could have on Arsenal and sacka later in the show and maybe that's a factor obviously havitz has been playing up front and he's not you don't think he's going to be with odard out it's whether or not odard is back for gameweek six and seven which he could be and we just we've yet to hear the the length of the injury we're thinking three weeks could be a month right that's what that's what the talk is but not been confirmed as yet um we'll get on to that in a bit let's look at goalkeepers low so I was going to ask you about um for buan because you know we're waiting for four or five option to stand out because at the moment the heavy hit of goalkeepers and say that mildy because they're five5 so it's not a big outlay at the moment it's still Allison and ryer out on top and it looks like you know if you went and spent the money that's been well spent at the moment but we're braced for a four five to break through and when they do that could be where you save uh and when people wild card in six Maybe by then there's enough confidence in a four five to move there it could be fleen with great fixtures for brenford for example but you've also mentioned for buen and you've also mentioned the rotation between the two of them yeah put my neck on the line a little bit last last time we one of these when I said the BR was going to reclaim that spot from from still I didn't you know expecting him to get a bloody low move or something but luckily he came straight back into the side I I do really like for Bren I like him as a goalkeeper I like I said I do think Brighton's defense in the medium to long term will improve um the trouble is you want him for the next two because that's when we got two really really good home fixtures and I I'm not really sure what happens in those I think we we we should keep at least one clean sheet across those but I wouldn't be too surprised if we conceded in in both um but if you if you go over to the the fixtures quickly um I mean ver Bren and fleen have got just an unbelievable rotation um you obviously would bring in ver bran playing this week for I switch and and Forest and then you'd play fleen for West Ham and and wolves uh you can also then play him in Manchester United as well which is an awful Brighton got Newcastle away and they always find a way to beat us so I'd probably stick with fleen in that one but then you play for Bren uh with Wolves at home and then you move back to fleen and you have full Bournemouth and Everton so the toughest fixture from now right up until gameweek 12 is that decision between Manchester United or Newcastle the rest is as good as it gets I think the the only thing with that is if you're planning on doing it a bit later you don't really need for Bren because you can just keep fleen so I'm I'm seeing teams you know wild carded with just fleen F the next two are rough and you're probably not going to get clean sheet either of those but then from then you've saved the0 five and you can just play flicking across across the board but if I was doing it right now I think I'd go with both I'd counter it as well by saying you know you're spending 9 million on a keeper there you're getting two four fs and you can get for nine five for an extra not five you could get Ry or Allison right so it's like the degrees of savings you're getting then goes down and then you've always got to get the rotation right whereas you can just stick Ry and Allison in and then forget about it so it's whether that not five is going to be worth it um and it I'm you know I'm a big advocate of saving money and team value so yeah there's no question it could be at some point I think at the moment again it's it's too early for us to know which is the best route to go but flecken from six looks very good and um he will be the go-to for wild cards at that point there's no question just because of the fixtures but also yeah 17 saves made so far um he hasn't kept the clean sheet they've conceded four goals in three games which isn't terrible but 17 saves is by far in away the most saves on show here so flein is what we knew he was um you know some someone who makes saves a lot of saves in a game as a result any bonus yet because what's interesting is no Keepers kept no Keepers got any bonus without keeping a clean sheet as yet which is what we expected because of the anywh near nowhere near no so you're not I mean fleen might get you save points but don't expect that to be coupled with a bonus Point here and there because it doesn't look like it's going to happen this season um and obviously the flip side of that is that Ray has been fortunate in that they have conceded shots he's made 10 saves and in the two clean sheets that he's kept he's got an average of two bonus points so yeah you've got to keep clean sheets to get bonus as a keeper it seems yeah um I mean the boat it's still cheaper to go with the two four FS than go for for Ray and and a four so you're still saving a bit of money there and obviously You' then pair it with a Gabrielle or a CBA to to cover the the Arsenal defense um and you could bench them for the next two if you don't think they're going to keep you know if if you think they're going to concede and then bring them in I mean I think Allison's at still a nogo though because I still think you want to keep that third Liverpool spot yeah available so it's Ray it's Ray or well it's Ray the rotation or just flecken I think they're your three options I wouldn't be going near anyone else yeah and I think we're going to see the the movement towards fleen but I I don't I mean I'm not going to sell rare I don't think maybe I might do on the Wild Card depending on when that comes out but um at the moment I'm going to hold tight and see if a 4 five really a strong four five really does a m so it's questionable whether brenford Ed those fixtures it is an incredible run though and so fleen I'd expect fleen to emerge but we'll see we'll see how it turns out pford miserable 24th look at that yeah I mean it's just been 10 goals conceded he has made nine saves so he could yet be a four well he could yet be I was goingon to say 4 five he's not he was five million which obviously he stacked against him he's gone down to 49 as a result of the start he's had don't see him being a factor um in our season at all Grog day isn't it from last season exactly what we said last year you know they conceded loads of goals in the first few weeks he looked absolutely Dreadful people wild carded him out got rid of him and then D got them playing and you know turn turned around um but I mean they there's nothing positive really the only thing positive about Evon was that they should have been outside they honestly should have been five nil up I think in that game against Bournemouth I thought they were brilliant particularly in the first half but then PF pford made a mistake he's I think that might even be the second one he's he's been he's um because it was against Spurs wasn't it he he did the clanger for for son yeah just took off his T knocked him yeah another one in this and you know when you've got you know one of your star players doing that you've you just ask him for trouble um so they need to massively turn it around but I just don't see it for now D has either got well it will turn i d would be gone because um you know he can't keep losing games by this margin so he's got a turn for them I me you know we'll see maybe pitford can do what he did last season it should help us yes absolutely I mean he's a key player isn't he uh Defenders uh Trent reigning Supreme 0.67 next y on penalty per 90 ahead of the pack I mean the chasing pack as it stands here are Coleman milinkovic and uh sigar santom it's not going to stay like that those three will drop away it's just because of the sample size Trent won't drop away though Trent will be there all season I think yeah oh do you remember Coleman back in the back in the Glory Days moring I remember going for Bain over Coleman and it was an absolute disaster that was a debate wasn't it Baines over Coleman the answer was both I think but I remember Coleman out Coleman outscored him um was toward the end of of Bane's like Legacy uh yeah Coleman was a great asset though I loved it but yeah he he's not gonna stay he's not gonna stay this list Trent yeah is is he's he's gonna hit a massive hole soon I'm sure he is he's gonna he's gonna hit a I don't know 12 13 pointer and I think it could well be in the next two weeks against one of these two teams at home so if you're wild card in six you're keeping Trent I can't see unless slot drops him or it looks like he's massively falling out of favor or gets injured I can't see losing Trent can you I think he's just he's gonna get close to 200 points for seven million in a defensive slot yeah I I I see it that way I I just I just think that it'll take one big hall and then we'll see huge bandwagon I think it just hasn't arrived as yet um um yeah British 87 saying um is it no it's Nica saying suara suar suara won't drop he has got a very good that can't be right ITA yeaha siga um he has got a good reputation going forward and um the numbers here may be sustainable I mean the only reason why I think he'll drop is because sampton as an attacking team won't allow him to sustain that he has got he has got the goal of course um already and maybe there could be potential there as a four five box but I don't know ever play ever gonna play him well unless he's going to emerge as elaf Davis threat and you know because I do see him as being a four five and he's down in 18th in this table with 0.13 X on P 90 well below Sara but I expect I expect Davis to climb that table as soon as it Rich's fixtures soften up so he for me still the one that I would go with if I was going to look for a four five from a promoted team of course Romero and porro pretty solid I'd expect them to remain near this near this kind of area certainly porro um we're not going to go for Spurs for clean sheets all season but porro is a player that's still hanging on in a lot of teams um probably will remain in my team for now porro for Robertson is what I'm looking at Robertson is 0.26 somewhat behind Trent now do you think there's an argument there do you think the million Gap can be bridged what him and Trent no no no I think you know sometimes you've got to pick your battles when you're trying to cost cut and I just think Trent's got so much more to his game than than Robertson than Robertson has um I mean is Robertson six was he six5 he's six isn't he same as same as van D yeah six yeah yeah okay so because it was that van was the cheapest wasn't it and then Robinson was like one step up and then Trent was was the thing so I mean he's I'd definitely go for him over over van dijk but i' I'd find the extra I'd find the extra million for for Trent I just I just think Trent is non-negotiable for me he would he would be just be the first player in my in my team I think you could even build a case for not going with harand like you have not going with Salah anyone else I just if I see a team without Trent I just think you're risking you're risking it here that is that is a seven million asset taking up a a spot that you have to play a player in who's gonna hit a massive hole at some point to Too Much seventh eight nor 0.27 he's the one that could emerge when the fixtures get better for walls but they don't get better for a really long time I mean it's Newcastle and Villa next home Villa away then Liverpool then brenford away then City it's Dreadful I mean that not until really I mean you can't say Brighton away is EAS so you got to get to game week 10 you yeah you say yeah and is on even going to be in charge by then I hope so but if they lose every game up until gameweek 10 then there's going to be questions asked isn't there so yeah eight Nory could be someone we look at because these numbers are really impressive shots per 9 1.72 Chan cre 1.29 he's played left wing back now um in a back three which I think will be the preferred system while they ride out these tough fixtures so he will he will remain in this top 10 I think and he'll be someone we'll look at should O'Neal be there and they're still playing Wing backs and then I want to talk about Lewis and viio because V's crept in no honestly V's crept he wasn't in this table last week but he's crept in after more attacking display .22 they're I mean V's the goto if you want security but they're by Far and Away the city options aren't they at the moment yeah Lewis is is the interesting one of what you do again if you're on a wild card um what what you do with that I mean cardio had an xgi of 0.55 that was mostly from I think one good chance that he that he created he's still not the marauding asset that we that we wanted and when you've got Lewis there at 47 he's obviously very very attractive um you need to have a bench that kind of covers it if you're wild carding I I guess you go safe and you pick like a dunk or you know mikeno see there's gavves now formul in and face um so you can get rid of your Ben Johnson's and your barcos and and not have to worry too much about it but I still want a bit more data on on Lewis I still want to see a couple games this Arsenal games that's coming up is going to be massive because if Lewis starts in that then and plays 90 again and then you've got five weeks have been playing 90 and he started the most important game you know one of the most important games they couldna have all season then clearly he's got that kind of sewn up but Walker's lurking foden back in training and and lurking around yeah I think I would punt on him but I'd want to give it a couple more weeks but yeah you must be loving having you got little price rise out of well up to 47 got a couple of them yeah got a couple out of him yeah I mean that was the gamble like I bought him for one game and hoped he would play well enough to keep his place I mean he was impressive for England as well I just y he hasn't put a foot wrong yet so but we know pep like he he could let him down but the way he's talking about him I think that he's there now I think I think he'll have a place in that side I don't know what that means for Walker whether Walker gets Europe we'll have to see and that's what we want the answers on and that'll be the case very soon niik Williams in 11 seen a few mentions of him in chat the only query there yeah he is far forward yeah shots per 90 2.33 chances created one per 90 been an impressive starts the season for Williams that we've had easy fixtures what I would say is Moreno has been bought he could go at left back and Ana could then get right back Ana for me is a superior Defender to Williams and I think he he's good enough going forward as well so Nico not nailed long term so beware if you're thinking of doing that I wouldn't do that and well when we get get our draft video out of our of our bickering we've got Moreno there you you assured me with as much Vigor as I did with Barco that Moreno was gonna ask uh was gonna ask Williams from from the side so I'm expecting Moreno to be in very soon and Williams to be out or I will be very yeah no I think I think Maro will start it's a different his quality going forward is is really strong um neither Williams or or Ana can offer that and I think we need that that side because it does unlock H Ado more to have a natural eff foot or outside him because at the moment we got a problem where we the fullback doesn't go around k h Ador and Hao wants to come inside so we don't have that threat around to overlap him so Moro gives us that so you can see the logic know I think I I'd get Moreno I love I love watching Moreno play if he's actually is he nailed down like a moring fullback role for a as we've seen a good defensive side under under Nuno in terms of the stats he could be an absolute steel at four five yeah if we if we keep the good defensive data going through tougher fixtures so I mean this is a good test for us now we go to Liverpool and then we've got an easy game at Brighton but after that he really does s up you're going you're going to that I'm going to that looking forward to it yeah but we can't do it again we cannot do the game what are you doing now what you you going I'm in Madrid I'm in Madrid and and I messed it up I think because when we were thinking of dates um I had the forest game in mind but i' put put forest in the wrong week on the calendar I'd put it for this week coming forward so I'm I'm going to the IP switch game on Saturday but I thought that was The Forest game I know AB well last year you you had already had plans concert yeah want to see pay you can't turn that down they might not be play might not be alive much longer let playing the music so um yeah have to go to the city grounds um you know in the new year we've got to do it because we keep threatening to do a vlog while we're there as well and will enjoy that we do a live stream after ridiculous we haven't got gone but yeah absolutely uh we'll talk about Ben White just down there in 45th um he is aead of Anthony Robinson who's been the star for many FB teams so far this season but Ben White hasn't created a single chance yet nothing from him so um expect that to Pi uh to pick up but not justifying the price tag at the moment for Ben go CRA I'd still go CRA yeah yeah no fair enough uh let's look at mids oh h on whoa whoa whoa there's a play where do you want me to go where do you want me to go we have to talk bright Defender Lucas Dean oh you don't want to go there if you're gonna talk people in the G Luca Dean you are and you me unless I mention Luca Dean even if it's to say don't go there I've put him on there but if you're gonna chat people up into going Luca Dean you're asking for trouble after what you did to start the season no I'm I'm going to do the complete opposite I'm going to say that for anyone who might be newer to Fantasy Football or whoever who isn't quite familiar with lucaon to me he is the number one worst troll in FPL there it is there he is there is no one more of a I remember starting with him a few seasons ago and his underlying stats are really good he got like blank blank blank and then scored own goal and then they conceded in like in like the 90th minute I think he scored an own goal and that is owning Luca de he can be as good as you want he can have all the great stats great fixtures for Villa I promise you you bring him in you'll regret it don't go there that's that's my that's my you know Happ next big Hall coming big Hall coming for because he's that's what he does when you think he's he's gonna do well he doesn't whenever you think he's gonna do badly he's hilarious because he find he finds different ways each time and they get more Bizarre by the minute don't they like he'll get booked in the last minute when he's just about to get free bonus or something he crazy yeah honest never known I've never known a player so consistently troll people who go there it's unbelievable oh Darwin's getting there but yeah well yeah to be fair Darwin is Darwin and Dean right up there uh midfielders uh you have to have one start to appear on this table which is why gacho is right at the top but he's only had 124 minutes a very small sample he exra on penalties is 1.19 he's right at the top of all midfielders but then like this week you know we get to the Quality sorry was as I like G this week yeah yeah there's no question he's a good player he's not going to be number one for XG on penalty over the season he is going to drop down but I expect him to be there or thereabouts in the 30 for sure Salah will probably be top in his table for most of the Season he's there one extra non penalty per 90 at the moment and then Diaz 0.94 de BR a 0.93 yeah Diaz incredibly High um and I want to bring up you know we've got our key performance indicators so I've got those again I just want to bring them up again because so this table is basically showing midfielders this season who have improved on their XG non penalty per 90 compared to last season gacho right at the top 0.79 we go down to Diaz though so he's improved his XG non penalty per 90 by 0.37 um but if you look across he's also improved his shots in the Box per 90 by 0.22 N9 and his chances created by 90 by 0.60 so Diaz at the moment even though it's a small sample we've got a combination of the ey test and this data to suggest that Diaz unders slot is a different player now it is too early we can't jump to conclusions but how much longer do you leave it before you have to start thinking Diaz has to be in our teams well again to talk about the draft because that was kind of window into what we were thinking we were we had a brief discussion didn't we about whether to draft jur or or Diaz because we could have had either I think it was our it our third pick wasn't it we could have had either and in the end we both agreed that Diaz was was the one to go for and at the start of the season I think we both would have said I mean I went for jotter over Diaz um obviously J's our biggest biggest fan uh but you were I mean you also whal about about Diaz but I think we both probably would have picked y but it's been a couple of weeks the itest supports Diaz as the stats support um Diaz as well I guess you've got that slight worried about the international minutes this week the fact Darwin hasn't traveled anywhere I do wonder if he's going to give him a chance in in the team over over Diaz but the way Diaz has been playing be a bit risky wouldn't it to I think Diaz starts he might only get an hour but I think he starts yeah I just think he's just won all three games scoring goals Diaz is on fire and um I watched him actually I watched him in the in the Internationals I watched him play for Columbia against Argentina he didn't he didn't Sparkle to be fair so I was I was just interested to see how he perform in that but he has it's just the positions he's taken up for Liverpool that he is kind of hitting that that narrative that he would get more Central he would get more far post and obviously the cross is coming over from Trent and Salah that's where the creativity is is all that side it's all right side isn't it right Salah their most creative player after Trent and then you got Soso that side as well so we did say like if if the service is going to come in it does seem that J's not being that big number nine getting on the end of stuff it's Diaz Coming Far post get on the end of it is J gonna become the new firmino who drops back still does all right but it's Manet and cah who were the ones back then and I think I said before the manchest United game I didn't think Diaz has the potential to score as many goals as as man did but two really well taken goals against Manchester United two different types of goal as well and obviously the Counterattack goal he scored the week before that so he's scoring all different types of goals getting into the right areas like we keep saying stats are good everything you he's he's one to back I think because there's no real reason why that should digine decline you'd think if he's still getting the chances hopefully that would improve and he'd actually you know carry carry on doing well because he's clearly in the Elite Talent it's just amazing that like Gordon was so heavily linked wasn't he with with Liverpool yeah and I think if Gordon had signed I don't know how close they were signing Gord if that had gone through I wonder if Diaz would even be at the club right now because you presume he's going to play left side right yeah yeah you think so he not Gordon coming to take salah's place would he so they're paying 75 million orever it was for for Gordon I mean that could have been complete nonsense and maybe they were never really in for Gordon but there was a lot of rumors about it maybe agents Al for contract yeah maybe yeah um let's all back to B because um he was unlucky at West Ham um disable Luke Williams bought him um and was um was waxing liverpol about how he's gone Maverick again and he was unfortunate not to get return the in that game yeah and but he stands out well here does he 0.23 is xgi up per 90 compared to last season interesting chances created a down 0.62 so he's not really that creative Force yet but shots are up 0.82 so he's being more direct fre game small sample Etc de Bry never going to be a factor I guess foden coming back really puts a shadow over it right did you see that interview he did about his Pace in the news um EA Sports FC game he's he's been given 67 pace and he got his FIFA card he looked and he was like think they must have red me when I was on crutches last season which I thought was was very good I hope so I mean foden is an interesting one isn't he because if Lewis continues in that Central Midfield spot and Walker doesn't come back you know foden I mean it's ridiculous to think the player of the season last year might struggle to find his way back into the team but City have looks so effective in those first few games um that does foden automatically come straight back into the side probably but causes a bit of disruption to the way the way s been playing I mean if if things are as as they are now I think de bruyne is a good option going in from game week seven because the fixures if you go back to the fixures for man city um after that Arsenal man and Newcastle game were out the way you know full and wolf Southampton Bournemouth it's a brilliant run of four games so we might be looking to pair har up with with someone for those and if foden isn't really in the picture then de bruyne is the next best option because you would really trust anyone else yeah I mean I'm looking at that period I mean when I'm going to play my w I'm not sure at the moment I'm thinking maybe between seven and eight which is the next International break and game week eight is when I'm probably GNA have to get on a city player because I can I can maybe Captain Salah or sacka until then um because sack's got saned at home game week seven but you know when harand faces Fulham so maybe I can I can play my sacker against your Harland but certainly after that when Harland goes to wall s Anon B with if I'm not getting Harland surely I've got to get some kind of City attack there um and I need foden to be back otherwise you're right maybe it will be maybe we'll be looking at um at De bruyne and he you know he's showing he's showing a different player so far um but it's it's free matches we'll see if that continues I wanted to mention matoma here as well um because he's he's increased his extra on penalty per 90 by 0.18 um his other factors are all down though touches in the Box are down shots per 90 down as are shots in the Box he's getting some traffic this week because of the fixtures um where' you stand on him well I was I was kind of all in on him before before this week I had my my transfers planned before the I was Ring Watkins in for esack and I was going to ring matoma in for for Gordon I was pretty locked in on that and then I saw what happened with with Salah and I saw what happened with with J Pedro as well getting a getting that goal and getting another 90 and also the fact he wasn't supposed to be going on International Duty and then gets bloody Co up anyway because of because of an injury but we'll talk about him when the forwards come around um it kind of put me off off mat a bit obviously there's M there there as well for for a little bit cheaper but I really do like the matoma pick and I think his I think particularly against IP switch I think he could do really really well in that game because he's got I mean I'm sure most people listening to this have seen matoma play but he's an incredibly like talented and tricky player but he's got one move which just is so effective against weaker oppos opposition which is he gets the ball kind of just outside the area he basically brings it to a complete stop and then he just kicks it really far past the defender and just runs onto it and then just um centers it into the into the penalty area and I'll tell you that is going to cause who who's it going to be a right back Ben Johnson or whoever is playing you'd think Ben Johnson yeah he's gonna he's gonna ruin the right back with that rip switch I just think him against newly promoted teams is is going to be so so effective um because he was getting some Joy um you know in in other games this season not so muchal well exactly against against ashy L absolutely terrorized him so when he's playing against a maybe a less adapt right back he's going to be very effective um the touch in the Box for 90 is a bit concerning minus three um on that but yeah the ex number 90 is a bit higher because I think that's being that's been quite affected all for him um like it's interesting Salah is the only really big hitter here amongst the midfielders you you look up the list and yeah Bruno's up there so he's 8.4 and he has improved 0.27 Improvement on his extra on penalty per 90 which could be of interest could be enough for people to hold him for one more week but salah's in there you know so salah's XG on penalty is up as are his touches in the Box per 90s so and he shots in the Box per 90s so the key performance indicators are shown that Salah he's not in Decline it's going almost the what you make of his um what do you make of his comments after the match because they you know they said to him what's happening with the contract or whatever and he said didn't he um this is my last year at Liverpool and I just want to enjoy it yeah I I don't know whether that is Bluster to see if we what they can offer I don't think it's going to affect him people have said you know do you think he's going to like um simmer down as the season goes on as he's winding down and is he off to Saudi I mean I guess that would be the most likely out come I think I think Liverpool are going to be talking aren't they they're going to be thinking you know he's going to be going I think he's going to continue to prove to be someone who can be elite I don't see him declining as yet and Slot seems to be getting the best out of him so far and he's super fit so he can carry on playing in the Premier League there's no question it's whether or not he there desires of stays there I don't know it's interesting isn't it and you know they' got van dijk on the last year as well and and there was speculation about Trent so yeah yeah so you know is this the end of an era and are Liverpool going to go Full Tilt for the title because of that is it going to be a motivational factor I don't know it is interesting to that I don't think that's gonna impact fbl at the moment though there's no sign of that it's just sometimes when you've got these contracts I look at Tony last last season you know he he just went completely off the boil didn't he um I me was I mean do you remember aubameyang when he signed a new contract and he didn't score for like an entire season as well so you can make as many narratives as you want about it but the fact is there is this thing going on with Salah he said it's his last year and he started the season maybe even better than he started any of the last couple couple of years if you were playing top trumps and and the top Trump category was professionalism and you had Salah aubameyang and Tony who would have professionalism very good very good point yeah yeah so I think it's a different kind of fish isn't it salah's not someone who's gonna I don't know he's he's not gonna let perform think that about aubameyang at the time though wasn't he and he'd been scoring 20ish goals and got the goals in the FA Cup and he was kind of like the Talisman of the the side um I don't know what what really happened with that and now obviously all the stuff happened with Chelsea and at Barcelona his reputation's kind of in the mud but at the time it seemed when when they gave him that they give like a fiveyear deal or something it seemed like that was a really good bit of business yeah I really want people to invent top trumps with professionalism for footballism who' be top who' be top of your professional Harry Kane maybe I don't know is he professional I think he is given how long he stayed at Spurs out winning anything that's true um there's a lots of comments about bourou midfielders um why would you buy too seeno toer we're sleeping on toer um says Neils apples wow lots of the number of B yeah yeah is tavir so I'm having a bad night with pronunciation are yeah um the number of Bourn midfielders that are featuring on this table and the table we're going to go back to is is quite extraordinary Sinister um tavanir seeno uh rutar I got that right see I got all those right can do it when I concentrate so they're all in this table they're all improved on last season um and if we go back to the midfielders table you'll see that they're all there as well they're all up there in the in the top echelons of this table for XG non penalty per 90 Bournemouth as we saw with the attacking date if we go back to that were third I think yeah third 1.95 of the season so what do you put that down to is it I mean the fixures haven't been that easy I mean they're showing red there do you think that um we need to start taking them seriously as a source of value because seeno has been the one that's jumped out so far but maybe he's that it doesn't stop there maybe tavanir could be an option they have played Everton you know that's always a slight boost to to those more I thought I thought they'd struggle more I thought they'd be um I really like I really like Bournemouth as a as a unit um I really like the manager as well and I think he obviously did great things with them I thought losing slanky though would be big adjustment period bigger than we thought but I mean they did have simino who who last season stepped up um you know with with the goals been eight goals to him four assists uh across last season so that that's the difference between him and Taver is Taver never really got anywhere near those numbers I think he got about half or maybe even less of the attacking returns probably like five or six attacking returns last season whereas sea now looks like he's moving up um even more I really really like him at 55 I think he's an option and and I think you know again when we talk about going for H and going for Salah having to play three five fivs I think actually Rogers seeno and Pedro is a pretty decent three who were all all underpriced yeah I was looking at how I could wild C now and get to Salah Harland and it would involve dropping down to a soeno from Sun but I looked at it and thought you know what does that feel like I mean it is a big drop because of the the historical the Legacy that son has got in fbl he's an elite player no question almost almost describable as a heavy hitter he has been in other Seasons but seeno you know when we talked about Diaz as a player who could be exceed in his his value um seeno definitely fits into that bracket as well um and it's it's just how long we we wait before we start going yeah we we really got to take this seriously uh he's definitely he's definitely providing what we hope Rogers would at the moment and I don't know if that's gonna stop and Evan nilson has obviously arrived for Bournemouth but he doesn't strike me as a player who's gonna Cil seeno's attacking um Verve so to speak he's had so many shots he look up for it as well like when just just before it all turned for for Everton you know simenia was involved in a kind of altercation he was he was fired up he wasn't giving up that game despite the fact they were two- two down um so yeah I like that kind of fire about him and the fixures are good I mean Chelsea at home former for would have chance in that they beat them last year didn't they um can't if it was at Sanford BR or if it was if it was at their ground but they definitely they definitely beat quite early in the season but then obviously it's Liverpool then Southampton and Leicester so got that little they B they're Bott of the ticket from game four for 12 so you know out of this run they've got two very strong blue fixtures it's the Southampton Leicester double up that Arsenal have also got um but you know they do have Liverpool Arsenal Villa away City brenford away Brighton at home it's tough it is the toughest run on here so yeah you can be forgiven for ignoring seeno at the moment because of those fixtures but we might be sleeping on him we really might if You' if you've got the ability to bench him in against Liverpool and against Arsenal and then you probably look to take him out after the run but that still gives you three really good fixures I think to make that strategy of going with the the premiums more viable because when you've got Min Smith Rogers um and and him and then Pedro that's five all under six million we have we've never had that before people saying that yeah the move to embo has got to come it has got to come I think he's 15th in his table he's got three goals already in in 269 minutes .63 extra on P think it will stay there he hasn't had a pen yet but that will be did you see did you see the Southampton highlights yes suicide it's exactly what I said at the start of the Season didn't I I said Martin's not going to change and they haven't the thing is they haven't it's like Burnley they don't have the quality to play in that way at this level so I do worry yeah don't get me wrong I think emba is a great pick and I think he's going to be probably a must from from game week six onwards but I just wouldn't take anything from that Southampton game because I they were just it was comical genuinely comical how they were playing the mistakes they were making the invitation for the press against one of the best pressing sides in the league as well why are you messing around passing the ball out from the back like get rid of it I know no one wants to hear people say that I said got Howard Bellis is a good player but Bednar Jack Stevens they're not I mean they're not good strong Premier League Defenders who are good with the ball at their feet I would I mean they're okay they're not you know they're not necessarily really poor Defenders but I wouldn't associate them with being players who are press resistant right so yeah and and and I remember when Martin B Swansea does a city ground we were just catching them and they wouldn't change he just carried on letting us do it and and that's what I fear that could happen to S Anon I hope not because I don't want the promoted scenes to go down but what I saw at brenford was what I thought would happen whether or not Martin does start going a bit more direct he can change because he has done I mean he got the team up by changing the the the approach in the playoffs so we'll see what happens next but yeah they can't do that he he won't have an easier game all season in aumo to get two goals sure it was just ridiculous but he's a quality player there's no question yeah if you're wild card in in six which you you've talked about what are you doing about brenford are you going in bumo you probably have to don't you um the fixtures are so good and he is the best asset from from that side so yeah you probably you probably go at least one Defender and and then bumo um go a Defender would you I think you yeah fleen I mean oh you got youve got vanderberg haven't you we're hoping that he comes in if you got a four million asset with the fixtures they've got that again frees up a bit of money to to do what you want with with other areas he's a good player I think he will get in I think he's too good not to get in that side what who he comes in for would be the question but yeah another player I want to mention just so that we can clip this and say oh look we did mention him I told you uh Jack Gish I think or delete it B I obviously ignore what I'm about to say if he does nothing for the next if he does score next week then yeah it's all down to us want the credit um the numbers suggesting and what we're seeing playing for England as well greish could be turning the tide a bit he's only had 91 minutes and the numbers are up um do you think there's a chance that we could start seeing somewhat the kind of Jack Gish we saw at Villa no you don't see it no because why would he suddenly change the what he's you know he won the treble playing in a certain way which was his best FPL season for City and it wasn't that great it wasn't like we were all I think he was in my team for a bit and he got a couple of returns but he never looked like someone getting 15 20 attacking returns in in that season let's be honest it's not going to get any better than that for him is it that was him playing 90 minutes almost every week for a treble Winning Side this is him barely barely in the side with more competition um n not gonna happen it's interesting I mean talking about Ian right was talking about for England saying that you know to stay in in cary's thinking he's got to be playing for City and and you know he's been he's done the two seasons now he's a he's not a veteran at city but he's certainly a senior player there now um yeah it's staying in that team will he be able to do enough and what role will he continue to play the role where he is he's effectively being the magnet for defense so they can create space which is what he's been there he's not been it's not been about output for greish it's been about sacrificing his own output for the gains of the team um I just wonder whether that's going to change because pep what pep will do which all good managers do is they'll change the way they play they they can't keep playing the same way and they'll they'll reinvent players Within system and so I just wonder whether there's something worth keeping an eye on I'm not saying it's going to turn into output yet but I think it's it's worth certainly when foden is back and we start to see what Pep's gonna do and whether or not he is going to change things up whether greish becomes a different type of greish I'd rather yeah I'd rather pick doco at the moment I think he's just I mean I think even if greish plays we're still not sure he's just going to get the ball recycle it and everything oras at least if you get 45 minutes from do he's going to go we remember we I think was it last season we were like guo's gone out and bought Dau who basically was greish from when he was a villa yeah that kind of tricky tricky Winger yeah we'll see I mean we can't really judge city until they're back to full strength until Rod is there until foden's there and that's that's what we'll see but um yeah I just want to keep an eye on and just thought I'd mention it because it's always nice then go we didn't mention him mention another 10 players and one of them's going to come in surely so uh I's talk about sacka and odard then because sacka has this table 13th 0.72 odard could be out for a while Premier League put this up this is based this is completely ripped off a premier league article but I feel like put format so yeah exactly well I had to do that because it was so blurry and hard to read on their format plus of course they did Miss off shots per 90 even though they mentioned in the article so that was a bit slack of them terrible yeah standards um so I had to put shots for 90 in there now I've highlighted the key stats uh the point points per 90 the Arsenal gain with odard 2.1 um and it's 1.7 without odard so not a major drop but a drop nonetheless uh with odard starting shots per 90 go down from 15.9 to 13.3 and goals per 90 go down from 2.09 to 1.63 so that's the biggest drop the win percentage as well as worth talking about there 66% win rate with odard 52% without him now I look at this think yes there's a drop but then you look below the pink bar there and you look at possession you look at pass the final third passing accuracy passing accuracy opposition's half no difference no difference to that whatsoever so it doesn't really affect their pattern of play without him it does affect their results but that could be down to I mean we're talking about 19 matches with that could purely be down to the opposition right it could be down to so I don't look at this and think oh it's disastrous for Arsenal like many people are saying do you my bigger worry is what we touched on earlier which is having to move havs back and playing a false nine system with with trossard um I think this is this is where you know everyone thought Arsenal would go out and get a striker this time and Jay's had a pretty good preseason I think a lot of trust was was kind of put put in him I'm still I'm still not convinced he's he's the one to be leading the title charge for them for them up front although I did think that about HZ and he's he's obviously stepped up havs is so effective at the moment that taking him away from that role is is what what worries me so it's going to be what hav parte and um who else is going to be in the Midfield H parte and because rice is out guard's out geino gonna come in could do a bit of a a crappy Midfield isn't it they got Sterling right we haven't talked about him is he gonna be a factor yeah I mean he could go he could go up would he go false nine over trossard I'm not going to go I'm not going to start the Sterling false 9 prop my point is that they they're playing Spurs next it's a massive massive game for them spurs will surely be looking at that Midfield and thinking we we can for the first time we can dominate that mids we can dominate that Midfield dominate a big word I think or or or get at them HS parans and um who you who did you you just say georgino yeah yeah I mean georgino is not bad is either but I think I I I really do think that he going to stifle the amount of amount of chances they get in that game and it is Spurs they're going to be leaky but I think they might be relying on more of a from a corner or something like that where Spurs are weak from corners and they've obviously got Gabrielle and and celba I don't know how many open Play Goals or how many chances they're going to create with that with that Midfield um Mr Greg is a regular hello Greg um he's reminded us that Martin and have a sacka trossard they can get some goals I I totally agree so what I mean I'm going to show some more dat let's let's show some more data first this is this is totally ripped off I just rip people off really should put this off an opto analyst I mean I do go to the trouble of finding his stuff and researching and reading the article so thank you very much opter analyst for this stuff this is basically number of involvements in open Play Shot ending sequences which I love as a stat so it's a basically events that are leading to either a chance created a shot on goal or a shot ending uh sequence so he's played a part he's made a pass in a sequence that's ended in a shot he's the top midfielder in the Premier League last season for that so that kind of goes against what I said about two minutes ago where Arsenal miss him so much this would indicate that they would but I will say also look who's third sacka right so they have got someone there who can take that up and and and fill that void to some extent it's not like they're not going to create chances about odard there because they've got an elite player in sacka of course but that is significant you would say um you know there's no question they will miss him deck and rice could arguably be an even bigger Miss so we don't know what we're going to get from Arsenal in this game I'm GNA show you one more graphic again for MTO analyst and this I think if if you if you were to ask Arsenal fans who yeah the one player they would want to not be out of this game obviously it's between rice sacker and and odard but I I think it would be odard I think he's the worst player they could lose for this the captain like the fact the impact has other positions in the team the the way he started the season has been really impressive bad no I'm not I'm not questioning that and then this adds more field to the fire this is the chances created by sacka and um odard as a pairing when they fed each other basically for shots and their combination which I think is yeah 46 chances between them is the biggest of any pairing in the Premier League last season wow didn't know that yeah nicely plagarized mark I know um so you know if if if there's a if there's a narrative to say well sacka would be fine with odard well this kind of suggests that it's a big blow to him because as a pairing they're incredibly effective good news for me as a as a probable seller of sacka this week yeah I mean I I can't I can't really make a strong case for saying it's not GNA have an impact the only thing I would say is that what Arsenal and Man City have in common is they're going to drive each other in every game this season there is no question Arsenal and man city will go into every game and play every minute as if they've got to win that game there are no games that Arsenal or city are going to play where it's one all with five minutes to go where they're not going to go all out to win it now I'm not saying you you would think well that's the case of any team I don't think so I think the intensity in which city and Arsenal play and and fight for every point to the very last minute is higher than any other teams in the league maybe Liverpool will get there this season but the reason why they're top two is because they're driven by managers you will create that Arsenal will go to Spurs regardless of their lineup and they will expect to win and they will fight to win to the final whistle so there's no way that Spurs are going to roll them over two-nil there is no way if Arsenal lose it will be 3-2 4-3 or something ridiculous I don't think Arsenal will lose I think they'll still win the game so I still think Arsenal will score more than one goal possibly two maybe three even without odard and rice because their desire to win every game to win this title and this season they've probably got more chance than any and less OD guards out for ages we'll carry them through I think and therefore if I think Arsenal are going to do that they're going to win the game they're G to score at least two goals I'm not selling sacker yeah I think SPS are goingon to win do you I think Spurs are gonna win it yeah I think again you talk about drive and and all that I think they're going to look at this and think we're not going to get a better chance we're not going to get a better chance in the next few years to to beat AR to beat Arsenal you know the fact it's a home game as well early in the season put a dent in their title charge right now there's no bigger motivation for Spurs they're not as good a team but with the with the missing players for Arsenal it's a lot more even I think that it's be a good game yeah yeah but I just think what I've seen from Arsenal's artetta is they find a way now and I think that they're growing as that kind of Team all the time and I think that yeah these are major blows there's no question and they've got Europe and then they've got City it's a really really tough period for them to lose Declan rice in this one game but also Oar to injury no question I think it is being overplayed in that people are going oh yeah Moreno's out and so on it's like they're not even in the team yet cury is not in the team and you those four names are being mentioned Arsenal are going to be without these four key players hold on a minute two of them haven't even played yet so people want to build this narrative up that they're absolutely crippled by injury they've lost two major key players no question but I still think they're going to win that game and that's why I think that I'm okay holding sacka I wouldn't wouldn't I wouldn't not endorse going sacka to sell out I see the logic in it yeah but I wouldn't be surprised if saaka still comes through and get something out of that game because Arsenal I think will still win it I mean I'm expecting I'm expecting him to get something from from the game um but I don't think it's I I would be a lot more worried when I saw rigar go off I that kind of made my mind up that that sack was going to go I think before that happened I was actually looking at spending the money because I'd already done esack to um to Pedro so you know because I thought there was going to be a double a price drop for for eack and a price rise I got the price rise but obviously not not the price drop um but then I was looking at other things I could spend the money on rather than getting rid of sacka because I thought I can keep him play him against Spurs but once odard got off I thought now that's that's just one that's just an extra incentive now to to take a punt on him not not delivering him next two it just feeds into the narrative though if sck returning that game last season and and if he does you can just see people go yeah but then the odard injury convinced me they'll say oh as Black Box presenting all those numbers partnership yeah true I I mean there need to support selling sacka to go sell and I absolutely see that I mean it's of course it's logical sell's got great fixures sack's in a team without two key players with tough fixures absolutely makes sense the only question I would ask is do you think Arsenal can win at Spurs I think can so if they're going to win at Spurs sack's got a good chance you've done well you've played both sides like a Ab I've nailed my colors to the to the sicker out Mast and here you are genius this is how you get away with this stuff and I don't genius I know years of experience doing this stuff let's talk about forwards um yeah it's a shame about havs because my my tactic ahead of gameweek six is going to be and hopefully still can be Isaac to hav just as you say because I want to get on I really want to go treble Arsenal and if I'm not wild carding then I'll I plan to save two transfers going into six and get inmo and havocs at that point um so if oar's out that could that could dampen my enthusiasm for but he's here he's ninth in the table 0.53 he's got two goals one assist it's been a really good start for um your favorite Sunday League player as yeah yeah he's uh he's started I was definitely put off by the the positional reclassification um a mid moving to to a forward and he needed to basically do what he's been doing and he's been very very effective uh in it um I mean if you've got him you still you still play him don't you I don't think he's a he's a cell he can still do damage from from the eight position that's the position where I wanted to see him last season and I didn't actually think he could make it in that in that nine because we'd seen him at Chelsea playing across all different positions and not really nailing his own he started off from the wing for them didn't he and then sort of moved a bit more Central then dropped back and never really made any position his own well he's definitely made that that nine position his own and yeah I think going into going into those those games against Southampton and Leicester you want sacka you want to pair another attacker really I think for those two it has to be habt especially now OD got out agree yeah um I mean Harlem we don't really need to talk about the only thing I would say about Harland is 71% accuracy 50% conversion that will regress there is no question he can't maintain that whether that means that he's going to have significant regression of XG on penalty I don't know we're expect it to come down somewhat but it'll hover around where it is now 1.05 but he won't get 13.72% 90 so that that will start coming down I hope he had another good chance though that West had four could had four in that game and and I have never when we talk about players going back toback hatrick and regressing I've never been less convinced about regression than I am talking aboutand because brf at home as well it wouldn't be completely out of the Realms of possibility if he got a hat-trick of hat tricks what I can as someone who would go into harand without Harland again is that Frank Thomas Frank is a shrewd tactical manager um brenford are a team who will play fre at the back and they do have physical Presence at the back and I think that I think that they'll do enough to keep him down to maybe one goal that's what I hope um b brenford aren a bad side away from home um they're not going to get skittled three or four nil I don't think and also after International break we often see some drop off yeah clip that not the greish nonsense if I offered you if I offered you a forest one-nil win for a Harland hattrick would you take it yes of course it's a forest one anfield of course I would I'm Forest first fbl second but um yeah be like oh Sal captain Oh three million rank oh be a bit of me like that but you know I I was three million this time last year in the world and didn't there so I'd take it for a one0 forest for sure um yeah I mean Harlem will aggress because that conversion rate that accuracy is not going to continue but like I say you you when you talk about regression you're confident normally but you're not when you're talking about Harland are you at all um wher up there which great to see um I'm not going to propaganda him anymore because being arrogant about having him in my team but Watkins let's talk about Watkins where what are we doing here oh yeah it's an enigma isn't it what's dreon wrong is he's got a niggling injury is he being must must have mustn't he I think it must be like that that salanki injury you know when he was like carrying something but he was kind of still playing and it wasn't bad enough to restr him but um I mean sank game is a bit different to Watkins isn't it Watkins relies more on the pace I'd say to get him behind yeah because slank drops deep and and and slanky can can be involved in in that whereas Watkins needs you know to to hit on the break so it's obviously affecting him more he hasn't been pictured in training has he haven't we haven't seen any training images of him we're talking about Watkins are we talking about neither have neither have as well as it as it stands time stamp Thursday night 11 o' climing 11 o00 but Watkins I mean again before the last episode you and I were esack to Watkins 100% we are not going into Everton at home without Watkins Everton did their best to show us why we shouldn't be going against that because they completely capitulated and Philip definitely gonna get chances against them but another 60-minute Cameo and then not seen or heard of in two weeks I mean they have got Champions League to come right so we know that's that's that's l in and um so that might managing the load is is is something that Emory will have in mind and presumably Watkins is going to be playing Champions League games all of them because of the new format they've got an able Deputy in Duran right so this is always bring that player on and that player is coming on and scoring goals um so it's a worry isn't it we we definitely can't look at Watkins now as an assured asset because we we want more we I mean with the injury time we're not just losing 60 minutes we're losing you know 35 30 minutes we're losing 35 to 40 minutes right and we know that the XG typically in Premier League the XG in in blocks of time is stronger at the end of a game right that's where the greater amount of XG is generated so losing a player consistently for the last 30 minutes is not someone we want so we can't go there yet I I don't think he's ready to play 90 minutes I from what from what I've seen so far I I think it would be more of a surprise if he played 90 against Everton than it would be he either didn't start or played 60 again and because of that playing those odds I don't think you go there he's too much money with so many other good assets around nine 10 million and no penalties which is obviously now going to Morgan Rogers after his was it for the under 21s ringland yeah took it well great Ben yeah great Ben yeah that would be handy it might be the only way he gets us any leeding points well he might get him if Watkins isn't playing because bloody Watkins that keeps messing up his assists it's true Rogers is great I'm keeping him for sure um anyone else you want to pick out here Evan nson good start but only 135 minutes so far Chris Wood is just L does he keep his does he keep his place when's he gonna get dropped yeah um yeah I just don't see Big T Being Fit enough yet um I don't think I I actually think we're going to go Force nine at hfield I don't think Chris Wood will start that that will hurt yell yeah you won't be happy to hear that I I've just got a theory we're going to play James W prows um play Anderson behind Gibbs white and play Sorry have you ever we've done for nine we did a for nine preseason and I think we did it at anfield last season which didn't go well so I I Woods traveling back because he's been in international Duty plus of course I think we need to get James War PR in the team at anfield because with alanga and Hudson adoy win three kicks around the box and you've got you've got someone who can score them right so our best route to goal could be winning three kicks around the box right and we've got players in in Gibbs white Langer and Hudson Andor we've got players who can absolutely do that so I think you know wood would just slow things down and I don't I've got an inkin he won't start um you don't like wood do you I well you can't knock him because uh there's a p because very good because I think it's some like 16 goals isn't it since the since he broke into the team so I think he's scored more open Play Goals than any other any other forward or something ridiculous other than irand so his record is incredible but and he just finds a way but it's the role he plays in our buildup he does slow our attacks down and and he's not I don't know I just think at w anfield the the the graph that we'll get from having Gibbs white in a force n might be the way we go so let's see let's see what happens there's there's a couple more I think we should just cover aware we're reaching the the 2our mark rapidly hav done predictions yet um but I know there's lots of people talking about Welbeck there's lots of people talking about Pedro as obviously he's played 45 minutes for Brazil and he's got the private jet back and all the stuff going around that but I mean which which one of those would you would you go for because I'm I'm seeing this there is a lot of talk about them people are worried about Pedro so they're going for Welbeck yeah I mean shortterm Welbeck but longterm Jiao Pedro I I just I just think herzler likes him he'll get the pens I think it I do think that he'll end up in the nine I mean you know Brighton better than me but I just think he he offers him a bit more than well and well backck you know he's M you got to manage his minutes so you're probably while you're in you know people players like rout are getting up to speed wck starting but I think when when rout is available um we'll see the change and it won't be J Pedro losing his plays I think it'll be world back so I think I can see why we're going world back now because the trip back and you know is is y Pedro going to start I think will I think he will start what do you think I I think he might I think he might come on at halim I saw with matoma last last season um that would be my prediction that he comes on a he comes on at halim but he is the not the fact he's played those 90 minutes in all three games does show The Importance that he's valued at in the side which he wasn't really getting last year so yeah hopefully hopefully starts I mean Welbeck is a good option if you're going to be wild carding in six and there is a part of me that wishes I had gone Welbeck um I went Pedro early because he wasn't supposed to be going to Brazil he was supposed to be staying at home was a shocker wasn't it having a nice little rest um so if I was buying one now and and while cing in six I think I probably would go wellbe you know because I think he's almost certainly gonna start the next next two is he gonna be in the team by game week six yeah he'll start well Beck will start the next two I'm sure he will yeah I just think the longer it goes on and new players bed in M mat R's out so but he's not a factor you've got two you've got two weeks with with Welbeck as as an almost I say guaranteed start because he could miss out in seven um but he's definitely starting this week but yeah Pedro is the much better long-term option yeah and if you've tuned into black box this season you know when as talks about Brighton players you've got to listen oh dear let's talk at our prediction standings um before we get into our predictions and we're we're we're almost neck and neck um in fact we are SC 27 SC I want to talk about hotline at the top or or hottin or whatever you want unbelievable 77% correct outcome I mean that's ridiculous I mean I I know it's only three weeks but even that a 27% correct score as well yeah this is crazy numbers so I yeah we need to tap into what he's doing um because that's crazy I presumably he's a professional gamber and winning a fortune off the boogies every week but that is in I I I sense there might be a bit of a drop off um from from hot you mean it's gonna fall for the floor noran if he continues that over the season then he'd be wishing he played Super six or something rather than just our our stupid our stupid game Shar in hottin I can if you do want to get involved in this uh you can join the blackbox patreon there still time fre game in but you if you want to be winning the the trophy which is is very did you see this oh you've got the trophy we should put a snip of it in shouldn't we next week we'll stick it the trophy now exists it's no longer a figment of our imagination it's been delivered and it was described as very heavy from Richard as well as being very nice of course but there is there is obviously a trophy for the the winner of the patreon blackbox league and a trophy for the winner of the predictions league as well which is currently obviously been one by time I mean it's a heavy trophy but sleeper and manscaper playing for the Post so it's all fine exactly see we do invest back exactly it all goes back into the channel um right predictions now achingly familiar these again aren't they um so ampton man united you've gone two one United I've gone 31 these are very yeah very boring similar aren't they again we don't look at these we just put our scores in and then we only see them when we clip this for the show um okay we're going away we're man united so not too much to talk about there I don't fernandz though yeah come yeah we'll look at the captains in a minute um Brighton it's which both gone 3-0 that be dream me being at the AMX that would be an amazing result Palace leester we've both gone two nil come on mateta get me something the bottom of the forwards list I'm likely to have e more on that in a minute but yes yeah um fham West h both g a draw you've gone to all I've gone one all that might have something to with the fact that Smith row could be going for me so yeah on bench this week you fcy goals do you I found this one probably the hardest one to predict I don't really know I haven't really seen a lot of great stuff from Fulham so far and West Ham obviously were absolutely brilliant against Palace and then awful I mean it is Man City but really really poor against them so I just went with the logical draw I feel enough um and then filam West Ham yeah we've mentioned already Liverpool versus Forest you've gone 3-1 I've G 3-1 31 as well yeah crazy how we go here yeah I think I think we do score I think we do score but then Liverpool kill us off this is different different rather Man City versus brenford I've gone a kind of yeah no bias whatsoever I don't own Harland I've gone two nil you do own Holland You' gone 4-1 hatrick hat tricks Yeah well yeah you see them really giving them a hide in in do you yeah I think so they're just on it at the moment and I mean look at brenford when they play Liverpool they basically rolled over I don't I don't see it I think you know Thomas Frank sides don't do that they they've had some Joy against City in the past as well home and away so I don't know I I don't see it being that I think that City win harand gets something but I've gone two nil uh Villa Everton we're both back in three goals for Villa one for Everton for you I'm going 3-0 though you've gone 3-1 not have contour and I do um it's funny actually I got accused of oh Mark's predictions he only predicts the scores because he's got players his team what a surprise that I predict scores according to my fantasy team of course I do I wouldn't have the players if I didn't think they're G it's crazy some of the things we get accused of you up well you know obviously there is some ages of you haven't seen any of those comments you're not gonna you're not going to not own har and then go oh I think Man City gonna win 7even nil of course you're not you're not going to do that um anyway uh Villa versus Everton we've done bourma versus Chelsea close to being the garden center game but because is an eight o'clock kickoff I don't think we can find a garden center open at that time but you've gone two one I've gone two all yeah I know you fancied him turn them around yeah I can see it because you know Bournemouth started well yeah hav been very impressed with with Chelsea could even beat West Ham um could Palace at home um and I think other than that like mad 15 minutes against wolves um they haven't really been that great I mean they were all right against Man City in the first game um but couldn't really find a way through I like Bournemouth a good team first score we've had first out I know first one yeah terrible home win I've gone a draw next one's this one's different though yeah and this is interesting um and again could be the bias because you're you're selling sacka right and I'm not um what a surprise that it affects our predictions um you've gotten Spurs win and you've told talked about it tonight and you really see this as an opportunity for them 2-1 you're going for yeah it's close um you might be right they might need three maybe to to to do it but yeah I just think I'm gonna I'm gonna back Sam and and say yeah Sam's gonna Inspire them to to a narrow a narrow Victory they'll be delighted would they with a two1 a guitar store at this stage of the season oh yeah I mean they'll only I I reckon they'd wish that it comes at the end of the season and they can you know snatch snatch them from getting the title but it's too early to kill Arsenal's title hopes off but having said that any defeat is going to really hurt when it's Man City you're chasing I think in hope salanki will be back for this well nothing's been seen of him no he was close though they said for the last game against Newcastle I just have an inland he's not gonna turn up again um you know right I mean my my policy has always been with an injury just sell him because I've been on the end of countless man oh he's on his way back and he's oh we think he's back on it you know and it just goes on for weeks and you just never know how much honesty you're getting so I wouldn't be surprised if he's not back you can get Mata like me and get two points every week yeah it's a lot more fun I've gone two on Arsenal I do think Spurs score and I'm probably gonna hold on because I do think this could go you know I think Arsenal win but it could be 3-2 you know there could be a lot of goals here which with the arsal defense you would think no but you're right you're without Declan rice without odard what what are we going to get so it's incredbly difficult game to predict you'd hold it yeah yeah and then the final game which I've identified as the uh as the garden center game it's Sunday 4:30 it's a prime time for garden center really um but we both predicted loads of goals Strang you've gone you've gone 31 Newcastle away win I've gone two all I think it you know I just don't see the defens is standing up here well I'll be back in brunwood watching this with my my parents hopefully my mom's cooking a nice Ro dinner want to play now then don't think he will this would be basically my nightmare result so I've gone the opposite way to you of predicting what would be good for my team because if Newcastle win 3-1 and I've sold esack that is probably going to be maximum pain and I I think isak gets something I really need is I know I'm I'm really not that confident that that sacka and esack is outscored by Salah and Pedro especially if I think Pedro could be benched for 45 I I think it's really really close and using two free transfers on it as well I don't know tempting the fbl gods and we know what they do when we do that I don't I don't feel great but I'm I'm hoping that wolves can find a bit of form at home and Newcastle I've looked a bit labored so far but isach started the season in good form for Sweden obviously scored the goal against against Spurs as well yeah I'm a bit worried you see his comments about FPL managers as well yeah lovely that wasn't it it great and ially said he literally said he was going to score two goals despite me he basically said I love it when people sell me and then I do well yep I mean again it's watching that is horrible isn't it because you can just imagine going oh God and he warned us and there's just so many things that you can see being played back why that game got to be last in the game I could be having a really good game we and it gets to that and then he just goes mad and just ruins me absolutely horrible captains um Isaac features on this table because it's a good fixture of w wolves but we're looking at it's Harem versus Sal isn't it there's no question if you've got both where are you going Harland you are going Harland um he's top of the XJ on penalty 1.05 over sell one um you're going Harland interesting um I I minut before we look at Rob T's data which is always useful we throw it in at this point anyone else you want to pick out here would you be tempted anywh else Bruno Bruno BR after watching Southampton defend last game he's he's the one but I wouldn't trust Manchester United at all um Pedro if we knew Pedro was gonna start he could be a great option but I think we're gonna get mean how many times this season and I guess we need to bring up the Matrix here are we going to be discussing any other player AVN C and Harland I mean I know it's three weeks and they they've top scored and they've really delivered so that will change but you do start to wonder whether the bracket underneath when we're looking at you know the sacka son Bruno de bruyne foden that's the bracket underneath are they going to be able to make a step up because at the moment they haven't yet and and it's about what you talked about sacker earlier the ceiling versus Salah and harland's not the same is it I do hope they do push up but I just it's not happening yet is it we're gonna have those two weeks of Southampton and Leicester where sacka is going to be very very popular yeah um but other than that I think it's going to be Holland and sah but I mean if you're paying 15 million for Holland you kind of need to Captain him every week with the odd exception of a really tough game when someone's got a good one because yeah yeah like five and six okay but you're gonna if you've got harand you're going to Captain him between seven and 10 I imagine yeah there it is in The Matrix you look at that run seven and 10 it's full of at home walls away so home Bournemouth away I mean I really worry about not having him during that per um I can cover it with sacka for game week seven game week eight though where do I go you know where I mean will I will I still have son I don't think so so you know I you go Sal don't you home to Chelsea but yeah yeah yeah you do I mean Salah in a home fixture of course but then Salah goes to Arsenal when harland's at home to santon so I've got to where do I go there I'm not gonna have Watkins or Palmer am I so you know me saying I don't know when I'm gonna wild card I think I think I'm going to be faced with having to unless I've got some City cover then am I going to Captain Fen over Harland maybe but nine Nine's a Savage week nine is a Savage week for if you're going non Harland that is because that that's there's gonna be triple captains out on Harland again that week yeah and you can't go Salah at Arsenal and sacka own to Liverpool really can you I don't know could be a game of goals and you know you probably have to don't you you have to back goals and hope that that Salah will return I mean Watkins doesn't really deserve to be on this list does he at the moment but by then he could he could be more of a factor for us but you're definitely not captaining Watkins at the moment even with Everton at home and we were talking about it again last episode saying Watkins could be a captain opportun for us this week no chance uh let's look at Rob's data Rob T um robt fbl he puts out excellent Graphics like this based on spreadex betting odds and no question City's um 2.95 projected goals 46 percent chance um clean sheet versus Liverpool 2.8 projected goals those two right out in front with Brighton 2.40 yeah so those three teams are the ones expected to get the goals this week no surprise and like you said he does favor it does favor Harland over Salah here not only because the amount of goals projected but also the Monopoly that Harland has on City goals versus Salah yeah um so yes I think if you got both you go Harland if you haven't got Harland you've got a good bet in seller this this game week but that that's going to change as we get later in the season from game week seven onwards we've got a problem so we've got to address that and see what we do capy though I think is pretty cut and dry let's look at our teams in to round up on this is yours as talk us for it for the podcast this is mine so Henderson in goal with home game against Leicester I'm hopeful with some he can build his four points from last week uh it's Trent porro and Robinson in defense I'm happy with that obviously porro has got Arsenal but I'm backing them to win so then there's no way they're going to get a clean sheet but he is still taking up ridiculous positions um it's sacka jotta Gordon and Rogers which was a disappointing Midfield last week sacka is gonna go tonight I think for Salah um saca's very very close oh no sack's close to a price drop it doesn't actually affect me because he's already gone up one so I don't need to make a move tonight but it is probably gonna be sacka to S s's getting a price drop is he really yeah he's gone up to 106 now he's now he's dropping um I think so many people are making that move to to um and then har and Captain Mata who's been really disappointing since I bought him in obviously now has entia uh and and Pedro who who came in very early in the international break and Smith were on the bench so if Pedro does Miss out completely or if har misses out completely because there is some talk about um one of his friends has has sadly passed away he's been yeah they've said that he might be given um compassionate leave um for it which would you know really really rock the boat but he's been training today I don't think that's going to happen but want to monitor make sure your bench is is at least lined up correctly just in case I saw that in the chat and I thought well I better not highlight that comment because I've not heard that and that is like that's Furious speculation that we don't really want to throw in at this stage but yeah right he he has he has trained today though so I think it's unlikely I think he he missed um he missed a bit of time to to to go and kind of uh you know kind of not deal with it but you know yeah yeah yeah yeah deal with it himself um but he's he seems back but maybe he'll be given a bit of time it's unlikely fair enough um what do you expect then Green Arrow um I'm a bit worried about quite a few players josa Gordon Rogers mateta haven't really delivered for me yet this season um obviously Pedro might be benched poo concedes Henderson ConEd somehow much disaster is what you're yeah basically but I mean Mata has got Lester at home so it's not bad Pedro has got IP switch Rogers has got Everton so it could go completely the other way and I will have Sal and Harland so yeah I'm gonna predict about to finish the week about where I am 800 Kish yeah you'll take that right that' be right um this is me um Rya Lewis Trent coner Smith Rose son Salah Captain sacka Rogers isak and xal Pedro I am going to make a transfer and that transfer will be Smith row to E I have the money to do that yeah that's nice um and then the idea will be that I will probably roll next week and then go take true transfers into game week six and go sonto and bumo isach to havs is what I'm potentially looking at although looking at the captaincy coming up there might be grounds for keeping son because he could give me a route for the captaincy if I don't go Harland so I don't know I want in bumo for that run but I do have there so I have some cover of brenford for six this week how will I do like every week it will depend what Harland does so my fate is in his hands basically because I think Salah could EAS I think Salah will return I think Forest will lose I think they'll score two or three goals as I've said in my predictions I think I'll get something from sacka um I probably will get a clean sheet out of Lewis probably I could get a clean sheet from Trent but I do think we score coner could keep a clean she as well I think it's going to be an okay week but yeah if you don't have Holland it's down to that if he blanks you're going to get a green arrow if he scores you're going to get a gray or red it's it it's the way it's going at the moment if you can get both here that's the way to go it really depends on what my Supporting Cast does if if son E sacka Yeah isak in particular me isak could be a key player for me because if he's getting heavily sold then if he returns then he could be a Difference Maker so yeah it's interesting I mean these are scenarios that I'm glad we've got you know there's there's such Variety in the way teams are going and players who could have had that game week it's a it's a wider Pool isn't it than normal and but those Fringe players are so key because if you if you don't have a Palmer and he goes off or you don't have a sack or you don't have a har and you can't have them all obviously yeah you need your Fringe players your Rogers your Matas your Smith Rose whoever to chip in with some points to try and make up that deficit a bit and if you're on the wrong side of the premiums and your Supporting Cast aren't chipping in points you could you could have an absolute you know people can catch up 30 40 points on you really quickly this year there's going to be a lot of big swings for people this year and it's you're not going to get it right every every week but you just need to hope that you've got players in who can who can make up the difference yeah I mean I'm trying not to look at other people's teams and say I'm I'm basically going to logically get do the right move which I think is Smith Ro tza I like that and and then you know I've got to hope that one of son isak or saaka come in for me because if all three of them blank and Harland scores I'm getting red so I've got to get something from sonak and sacka I think one of they they're a good for yeah they they're good players um so I think one of those three will return and they're all going to be pretty significant differentials the way the market has gone because isak and sacka are leaving teams and son isn't in many teams so I think I'll be okay but it's it's the way it's every week I'm like that and I don't mind that I don't mind that I I want to rely on a a broader range of players rather than just the Heavy Hitters which was a lot of last season it was like well if Palmer and Salah and harand come in you're going to do well and and they were doing well every week so it's better it feels better and I mean I'm I'm so hyped about this season the way it's going so far I'm I'm not really concerned you know how well I'm doing I'm more concerned at the moment about the state of fbl and the way it is and it's getting me excited again about playing it which is a good thing which just four players the same this week team and at spells last year for the first time ever we had 11 players the same yeah and it felt horrible didn't it you were like 150 points ahead of me wasn't ideal yeah and you know we're we're more or less neck and neck so it it's I like it I like where we are I like where The Season's at I like the decisions we're having to make I like the dilemmas and you know the fact that people are selling eak and sacka and going I don't feel happy about it that's great that's what the D that's the kind of dilemmas we want playing this game right we don't want decisions to be easy we want to be punished at times and make us think twice that's what playing this game should be about um so we'll see we'll see I'm looking forward to the weekend um that's where we go apart from you've got two wild card teams to have a look at do you want to show them now we got over the two hours and might sck them up what's behind these then this is wild card one this is the Harland only team yeah I just thought I thought there's obviously a lot of people on on wild cards this week so I thought we could at least touch on on something so I just had to go putting together like I said I wrote the article just with a couple different ideas one I totally ignored yeah yeah yeah well until well only when you found out it was M me that's that's fine um but this is using plan FPL this was a while closing up because that's that's with ver bragen and flecken in goal with Trent Lewis and gayy um sber and Greaves on the bench so you've got s that comes in obviously for the great fiction gay week six it's actually son in to Target these two and then you'd look to switch him over to to sacka I prefer son for the next two weeks given I think Spurs are gonna win this game and then Sak um and then e Diaz and M and then Haren Captain I think I would still go for Watkins if I was on a wild card this week um although that's looking each day that passes and he's he's gonna start Everton isn't he unless he is injured yeah I think I would go for him but you could also move to isack and just just take the guaranteed start against against wolves I don't mind that either and then Pedro and then fleen Rogers sleep and Greaves on the bench I think this is a pretty strong team to World card into there's no real weakness there I don't think and you've got the double up on bright the triple up on Brighton for the next two as well the the AR Defender on the bench as well skews the strength of it a little bit and what you've got then I I guess you've done this to show the the um difference between the the teams with with Salo and harand so this is the Salo and harand team yeah and and I don't hate this um so this is Ray in goal with Trent Lewis and gayi so um same back three but Ray is in instead of the um the rotation because it's a bit cheaper to to do that because you haven't got to pay six million for for CBA um Saka e Salah M and Rogers um and then Harland and jel Pedro um up top and then the bench you've got to play you got have two four billion Defenders to have this so Stevens and Greaves are both starting I've managed to get DAP in there as like another option as as a kind of five5 you could put him down to a four five and strengthen the defense somewhere else give yourself a bit of a bench um I don't hate this I mean it's got Ry it's got Trent it's got sacka It's got Salah and Harland the issue is yeah the issue is is that you've got M Rogers and Pedro all under six million that you have to play every week and you can't really move away from them I look at this and go where are my transfers going to be a week you know unless I'm moving e out I'm not going to be touching Trent or Lewis if Lewis stays on the team I'm you know okay I could move four five Defender out in and out but that's that's a lot of fun isn't it so basically my my input into this team for a good period unless there's injuries will be which five five am I gonna move out this week it is do I bring in do I bring in I don't know if I want that game I mean this might well be the an optimal lineup is that a lineup I want to take on and and manage you know I I know okay is it about rank is it about the fun and engagement for me there's still an element of fun and engagement and I like you know the decisions we're making and we talk about it just now with the sacka and eak decisions these are tough decisions there are if they go wrong it's big swings those are the things I like I don't like going all should I go Min us a meno that's that's like doing weeks of that is GNA kill my enjoyment really if I get loads of points but I think it will I think you would look at around seven or eight to think about taking Salah out and redistributing your funds a little bit more um also the other problem with this is Lewis as well at 47 if he suddenly does get dropped you're then looking at Stevens and Greaves um coming in like a law firm doesn't it take Stevens and Greaves so you could you could do Lewis to to dunk or or to or to for defender or something to give you that certainty or maybe you do Stevens to vanderberg yeah it is a bombsite bench absolutely but I love that there's there's not really like I said unless you move the lap down to a four five and then you get in two four five Defenders um there's not there's not really a lot of movement movement here um in the chat trigger's in the chat that's not trigger lips is it talk FBA that I think it could be I think it could yeah um so yeah we welcome we're getting going very well at the moment um well I take it from the the badge that's him as well isn't it with the uh the Aussie reference I know maybe it's not could be and one comment I did want to I starred earlier that I thought was fantastic from Greg fost just in case you're settled on that sacka transfer look at that sacka scored 28 points against Spurs last season the most against any opponent there we go let's let's throw that one in there just to make you feel a little bit worried a bit more about selling fake news fake news fake well done Greg love that propaganda keep that coming um right should we uh should we hit some of the uh should we hit some of the super chats because we might keep going into the night we might be able to hit midnight if we keep going I'm so tired I'm just Delirious so yeah we might as well uh yeah should I should i r through these yeah stick a few on this is from flanny boy 1888 I am wild carding without Harland Team Rated at 95% in FPL planner with be in it and point three in the blank question is should I go for a cheaper City mid and if so so I can get to Harland in week seven still bra not going with him now but obviously wanting to think about how to bring him in a bit later if you didn't wild card harand now would you get him in seven or would you just try and ride it out by way thank you for the very generous Super Chat for yeah I I just don't see the logic in not wild carding him in now um is it because you feel the team will be stronger without him for this period maybe maybe you could create a team stronger without him for this period I'd like to see what it is you mean obviously it's 95% in in Ai and who am I to question the AI but you know um I'm convinced the AI is just slippers answering instant messages by the way every time takes a screenshot or sends it enough one to go yeah send that he's building it he's he's he's the brains behind it absolutely boring there's no computer at work it's just it's just Andy in the slippers um H got I I mean I think we looked at the capy Matrix right and we looked at that run and and you know we'll bring it up again now um if you haven't got Harlem from seven to 10 where are you going with the captaincy yes you've got sacker and seven fine game week eight you've got a problem game week nine you've got a big problem so I think that's what I would fear I think you've GNA if you're not going to Wild Card Harland in now yes you've got to get him in in May certainly by eight um so so if I go for a cheaper City mid I guess it has to be kdb at the moment because foden's not there um some genius about greish earlier maybe that's it there isn't a cheaper City mid is there um I mean rogery is is like six million or 65 but you are Delirious yeah you need not well my point is you're not going to go there so you're getting de bruyne to cover harand essentially I think you you just ride that if if you if you think there's not going to be much in it between them which I don't agree with but if you're going without him now I think you just accept that you're probably not G have him yeah so the same logic applies if you think that harland's not necessary now why do you need him seven I guess that's exactly I would argue you go harand now and then you wait for foden and see what happens and then if you need to move off Harland to spread funds you've got a foden to go to I would rather go to a foden than the kdb myself I would not be War carding about Holland now no nor would I no so that's that's hopefully we've earn at 10 pounds I feel like we have get in touch and we'll pay it back to youny do don't do any of the things that you're you're suggesting copy said David James says I bloody love these pods up the borrow yeah mid the midd fan yeah I don't mind midd they getting on this season W first I haven't looked actually I I I it's criminal actually because I don't look at the championship now long gone it's long on but um yeah I um I don't mind bar and is Carrick still there I think he is isn't should season last b b are seventh okay that's all right the championship is so groeling I mean I don't never want to go back there it's such a hard League really all don't miss it at all uh this is from Jordan nayed hi guys bench one of Gabrielle porro or Lewis Can't bench Lewis no it's it's um porro I would pces porro from open Play I would bench porro i' bench Gabrielle we say it because we're in pain because it's a very difficult decision there not much in it is there I I think there's only one team keeping the clean sheet if there's going to be a clean sheet and that's that's Arsenal um and so you're down to How likely is porro to to get an attack in return and you know he's up against a good defense so cor gab yeah I yeah but then Gabrielle's on Corners in a different I'll go Gabrielle myself over but difference of opinion that's fair enough yeah uh this is from ay thank you for Super Chat do you start Smith row at home to West Ham or Rogers at home to Everton Rogers yeah I'm benching Smith row currently for Rogers so we're on that front I I mean Smith row is not getting the full 90 yet is he still not so it's just expected minutes and um that's a factor plus you know Rogers could be on pens I we joke about it but he could well be um so and I think you know Everton have conceded three goals in every game so far so Everton is if if you're 5050 Everton is the team to Target at the moment at the moment yeah at the moment uh and then finally from Davy's family first um have Trent Robinson Johnson and Barco oh God sorry get the blame for that there's going to be teams of Barco in right to gameweek 38 gut punch you every week basically he's he's got a drop so you know would you do Hall to Pal Torres or wood to Pedro or Rea to Martinez and Hall to Lewis trying to remain in the Clouds of overall rank 13 well done David Family First well done sounds all right don't hate that yeah yeah R wood to Pedro is interesting given my theory about would not start in but I've got the certainly wouldn't get rid of ryer um halter Lewis I would do halter Lewis you can't you can't do halter Lewis yes you can no save some money oh I see I wouldn't do that then right yeah so it's the first one Hal to Pal to pal I think that's just a you're not going to regret that are you although would to would to Pedro that's a good long-term move it depends when you're when you're wild carding if if if you're wild carding in six I think wood to Welbeck wood to Welbeck oh you put well back in there if you're wning in six I'm gonna say Hall toal just so I can say toow used to be one of my favorite bands that's what you get you that's what you pay for with these super chats great advice I'm basing it solely on the fact I used to fancy Carol DEA Hal to Pal m m just text me and said that he just

stream never want to do that again you were I've seen you worse have you please you weren't great but you weren't you wer meltdown which is that's all right that's okay that's all right yeah fine yeah anyway enough of my stress another another box is done and I really enjoyed that we did two hours 19 minutes FB is back as and I'm pleased about it when's the next International break oh no it's four week it does kill momentum doesn't it this first one's a real problem because it kills momentum but even now I'm looking we've only got four weeks and we got another one they shouldn't have one this early no got change it it's misery for FB managers and content creators but we're back and we're pleased about it thank you very much for your support hit subscribe if you're new around here and hit the like if you enjoyed this stuff there you go very good uh is a good night for me good night everyone oh I've lost my credits there they are good night again [Music] [Music]",27897,good evening everyone for anyone saying the sponsors of blackbox pay us too much money have never had to sit with mark s for 35 minutes while he sorts his camera out thats all im saying my god like people say whats your superpower i think my superpower is i can take any trivial thing and make it stressful four years youve been doing this every week honestly my word right im okay i had to go and have a wii sorry as well right at the end just as we were going to go live on night im gonna have to go now was i was just are you joking but the good thing is a six minute credits mean everyone got to see like the full intro words on the screen there some people won have seen them all so amazing i hope our sound is okay because we havent had time to sound check but i think its all good that we sound good loud and clear says derek nos hello derek thank you for joining us n the karbers sals is camera out is quite the you no honestly it was nigel did you win b mark on the toilet this time i no i went in i used porcelain for sure no one will know what youre talking about there is definitely context needed but im not even gonna say it so no theres 783 watching i think the more technical issues we have the greater the audience way its always been way sorry were 35 minutes late and two hours later than the normal time of 7 were here its fun you got beer as well we are ive got a beer weve got lots to talk about guns out is the title of the show because everyone selling sacker odard injury dean rice is out theres definitely a tide a tial wave of people moving off their arsenal assets and i think im sharing the airways with one here arent i as you doing you are indeed and im im seeing the moves im planning loads of people are making those moves now some people making them for hits i dont feel good about them at all so im surprised so many people are thinking about sacker and isach out im im nervous about it ive already made one of the two moves so no going back now how it goes right in fbl one of the unwritten rules is when a large section of the community go with a particular opinion and that opinion could be a slid ind doors crosss whatever it is what happens next right normally it normally blows up in our face doesnt it any mass decision like this thats gone well i no exactly very rarely does it go called into plan which its disconcerting for me because im going to end up cing sellah so if people who are selling sacka getting sah and that doesnt work out then its still gonna hurt me because im probably end up captain so therell be some pain this side as if it does go wrong flanny boy 1888 thank you so much for the super chat already we will get to super chats at the end well probably be here till 10 to midnight or even later than that but thats all good we do it thats the thing we do right lets lets get on with some stuff shall we but before we do we better have a word from our sponsors and my word we earn those sponsors yes yes well everyone by now will be familiar with sleeper i think a lot of content creators talking about it a lot of people getting involved in the in the pickham league and we had our first winner from that and a playstation 5 well be going to our monthly winner of the of the pickham league me and you mark or you and i should say took part in our first ever blackbox draft it was fun it good i loved it it was like it revived memories of the old days i we were running the team together there was a little bit of two and thr between us you were nay saying my picks but i think in the end we got a team of 15 seven of which are all injured or suspended our team is palmer salanki diaz kuna rea romero aangi and bailey then it starts getting a little bit suspect with rice caori such anderson kadogo cliver honana and alex moreno but everyones in the same boat the first eight or nine picks were fine and then it was a bit it got a bit ropey after that i think were in a pretty good pretty good position against the others i think so once we get k galo play in and califur i cant why have we got why have we got these players i cant pronounce you idiot once we get them back from injury any players it would have limited us we were that was our policy thats absolutely true so im gonna love doing that and im looking forward to it looking forward and the sleeper app was good the interface was good it didnt crash no issues very smooth experience so get involved get involved if you fancy having a that is the message get involved try out the draft use the qr code on the screen give that a scan just give it go let us know what you think of it i thought it was a great i thought it was a great interface and the draft was fun and anyone asking where they can watch it there are im hoping theres going to be more clips like the ones they posted coming soon so if not well publish the whole thing arguments and the bit the bit when gi kept signing injured players and we were like it would you say hes gonna need a good physio like that no i said hes goingon to need jesus christ as a physio to revive them from the dead bailey is injured i know david yes bailey is injured we have picked some injured players as well but we havent got reese james how have we got on and alex moreno all right that be fine right fbl lets get on to that sh we lets look at our game weeks first of all shall we you did all right 73 got some points from henderson finally four points for him trent porro and robinson another assist from robinson hes hes done right in the first in the first few weeks pretty happy that for four five jotter gordon and rogers that was all a bit of a disaster one assist from sacka nothing from the other three attackers despite all all scoring goals nothing from jot is disappointing when des got the brace and salah got what 17p pointer so that was that was annoying harand and isach harand with a hattick captain carrying the team as usual isach with the goal hes been unceremoniously shipped out after his after his first goal of the season and beta whos blanked twice since i bought him in now has massive threat from other signings theyve made and im a bit worried about him and nothing much on the bench it was an okay week but like one player scoring over 10 and that was harlands captain the rest is pretty average what you make it j because we had high expectations when we learn hed start the season down the middle but diaz has been the one of the of the two s5s to come out and hit with big points so far j the right week one but i dont know he does seem to be dropping deeper and letting salah and diaz be the ones that tuck in is that your impression next year i have 08 in that man utd game which isnt ideal but 099 and 065 in the games before and had a goal and assist in though so going into the game against manchest united i was pretty conf he was going to get something and when the score goes to 30 you think hes going to be involved in some capacity but i think its just going to be one of those is i think salahs just going to consistently score points and then the other i put sabosa into that bracket as well probably not as high as diaz and j but i think theyre all just going to have weeks where they score well score weeks where they dont and you can keep trying to chase it and getting diaz but i think you just pick one and stick with them and until jot loses his places ill be ill be sticking with him people requesting to see how ranks ill get i there we go theyre under our names there and while theyre fairly decent well keep them head with noland well more than that in a minute lets get to my team and go through that no harland of course it was ryer two points lewis six trent six coner two smith ow2 son just the three sacka captain which was a big disappoint that in a minute salah 17 rogers two isach nine and wiissa who was my transfer coming in with goal and bonus 69 not great didnt have harland captain the wrong player and i will point out the fact that ive captain in salah only once and got a double figure return in match of the day game week two of captain e gw one and sacka game week three what have they got in common theyre both playing teams at a man sent off so on both occasions when i picked the captain other than salah the teams ive captained a player in have been reduced to 10 men with rightfully 45 minutes to go rightfully sent off come on dear me it was its frustrating because i think saaka sh still should have got more points because he had a chance right at the end and he was heavily involved was he had hint you on toes didnt he in the first 15 20 minutes it was very concerning and then we started to play a bit better for i dont know it was a it was a evish game but arsenal will feel like they should have won that especially towards the end like you say i thought i thought that was in i thought saka was just going to bury that and it was gonna break some hearts great result for brighton arsenal should have won it but brighton good account of themselves again and i was disappointed with son because i did think spurs would get something at newcastle and they played well did okay but newcastle grounded out the result didnt they and spurs again liking game week one at leicester away from home just couldnt convert their play into chances and goals and some hanging on this week i dont know whether hell go it doesnt look like it looks like im going to make another change but more on that at the end but wha was great hoped for turn got one now hes going to be on my bench for a few game weeks until brenford run starts in game week six onwards and thats where hopefully hell come into his own but ive noticed a lot of content creators talking about him now so good to get to him early the original the original and of course we know how it works because i got him first no one else is allowed to have him thats thats exactly the way it works right should want him its like last season so once you get some points from him hes dead to me im never im never getting this now ever good brilliant thats thats thats fine lets look at great and the good and see where we stand in that lets go this is why we have to drink the cams harrys gone top of that harry how does he doing its crazy isnt it because i think hes got salah and harand right like prazz so salah and harand teams have done very well at the start of the season and perhaps the shortcomings of going salah and harland dont reveal themselves over a short spell its going to take longer so thats thats my reasoning as to why i havent got sal but salah pra and harry have done started the season well n 1996 or 196000 for harry pr 2016 216000 rather general just behind them and then fran 584 just above me lukes in between weve got a we got a disabled sandwich between between us as luke is between us disabled just to make that clear he his he his online name good clarification yes and then andy coming up behind you so to speak its all very close all very close i would just say harry hasnt got salah hes hes harland was he not no he is he is harland only he has got the mighty chriswood though which explain will be will be happy with his nine points and e kept to favor of e as well which again just shows patience with players good line numbers eventually theyll theyll come good so its nice were were were not in the bottom the were not in the trenches at the moment both in the top million ill take that qualifying for europe at the moment in the great the good which is fine well keep going on that lets look at start looking at some data then team defense so this is caveat fre game weeks small sample etc were looking for trends were looking for trends that could continue one thing thats unlikely to continue id imagine is noton forest being the second best defense in the premier league but there they are at the top but of course as you see fixture difficulties they had theyve had the best start to the season with their first three fixtures city at the top low and seven chances per 90 conceded the best of any team here and whats interesting is one we expect city to stay in the top two the second point thats interesting is arsenal who have kept three clean sheets and well two clean sheets and were keeping one until brighton scored and they reduced to 10 men down in seventh we have thought arsenal would be in the top two or three defenses but theyre not and theyre conceded in 14 chances per 90 which is quite a lot considering their reputation going into the season as the strongest defense well its not a broken record but they were lucky to not concede to cabia in gw one and they were i dont even what youd call it how they didnt concede toy watkins in game week two and like i said they were in they were in good control of that game limiting brighton to a few chances the red card changed things we had a good spell when just after that red card which its quite natural and then they started coming towards the end but luckily we managed to score in that in that spell where we were dominating a bit more but its its were going to be talking about the ramifications of odard being out havs having to drop back into midfield theyve got lots of defensive options timber came in but califur is he got a knock or is he pushing he got knock an international break i thought so but that doesnt change the makeup of it are they going to adopt a more defensive approach now theyve lost because theyve lost odard and theyve lost their main striker because hav is gonna have to drop back to midfield you see hav dropping back and well no jeesus could return so well need to get our teta team news but the last we heard about jezus is following the international break he might have a chance so he could be back in the frame you see it then as tral out front hav dropping back do you to take od guards plays in midfield probably because who do they bring into midfield if they keep habits up top do they bring two stoppers wouldnt they its part still there he started the season so if they bring him in then thats good news for the defensive but not so good news for zaka presumably mourinhos still out isnt he so they cant they cant bring him in i dont know i think its its one of the reasons its been an up and down international game with the transfers ive been looking to make debating whether to take sacker out or not now ive landed on sacker out and i think this news pushes me into that because i dont think its going to affect their defense but if youve got reyya ca gabrielle youre probably not expecting a clean sheet in the next two games against spurs and city anyway but it has to ive in my predictions ive said that spurs will score i agree with you i think that i dont i dont think in o odard were going to look up ive got some charts and tables on odard later on in the show that well get to i me look at midfielders but i dont think it changes arsenals approach to the game in that they are i think by their very nature defensively sound in every game they go into i dont think they go into any game going all out attack they are first and foremost resolute and then theyve got quality up top to score goals but theyre not going to win games 5 six nil theyve become almost what city have become which is a side that can get results but never takes the handbreak off and manages games out thats what theyve become its a results machine and its no surprise that artet has followed the same path that peps done with city in that respect of the teams at the top that are full on attack youd have to say it was liverpool under clop whether it is liverpool under slot so far youd say yes theyre the team who will go full thr and score goals but that could be changing as well liverpool are third in this table defensively and i dont think its a long stretch even after three games to say that were seeing liverpool change and theyre now a team that are more pragmatic and defensive do you do you feel that theres not many managers is there that have come in and kept free clean sheets in the first in the first three games im ive been impressive ive rewatched the highlights of the liverpool man utd game and theyre just leagues apart in terms of organization everything its going to be its gonna be interesting know what slot does with trent because there are some rumors going around arent there that hes not totally happy with him theres always been question marks around his defensive ability well if slot wants to turn liverpool into a more pragmatic and defensive unit what does that mean for trent because you could argue that hes a bit of a liability defensively but makes up for it with attacking play but i dont think i dont think liverpool are getting turned into a defensive side ill take that back but its more about control its and which is what city and arsenal are about its about controlling the game managing the game and the result being primarily the goal rather than were going to go all out and play like the heavy metal football that klopp used to play i think were seeing the dial move back some notches from that theyre still scoring goals but what we are seeing is suddenly rather than just being arsenal were the only team we can invest in defense for defense suddenly city are reviving it seems maybe its too early to say but maybe city are going to be that strong defensive unit again that we can go to who knows who we end up picking viio or lewis probably but liverpool are now in that bracket as well so far it would say and there are ways that we can tap into it with potentially allison robertsons popular over the break as well ive noticed theres a lot of ai recommendations for robertson going in the difficulty with that is you have to then sacrifice potentially going for assuming trent and salah are in your side youre having to choose between a diaz jota or a or a robertson and i still favor the attack i think with the fixures the way they are but robertson has presented himself as a as an interesting option going forward but its and the other and the other interesting thing is whats going with coner and canate like is canate just starting every week now because then hes an option as well i dont want to get into that because people are buy c conon their drugs and blame me for that but i think when europe starts we know game week four onwards thats going to answer some questions isnt it on that front just wanted to mention and villa defenses here they are fourth and fifth in the table the table is sorted by xg conceded non penalty per 90 and weve got city top 068 forest second 070 then liverpool 079 bit of a gap to villa on 10 and then chelsea 109 i mentioned villa and chelsea because in terms of fixture difficulty theyve had a tougher start in the top three so therefore perhaps and again early days perhaps villa and chelsea could turn into sides that we can look at i think probably in that second tier below city liverpool and arsenal but perhaps villa and chelsea could be the teams we go to for some value in defense the difficulty with vill the champions league is going to start and how theyre going to deal with that with all the games that theyve got to play coner is popular youve got him not k quansa the other one the k coner but people saw the hard part of that and the reason why he got less than 100 points last season despite playing most of the game is just villa concede stupid goals and concede goals and even though the stats are the underlying stats are good i still dont trust them in that area you lose that attacking threat that you get with someone like robinson for example at four five but the fixtures are nice so you are going to want to play him i just id still favor coner to like co will though at four or five i trust chelsea even less the teams just seem to be able to get at them and im surprised to see them at fifth on list they seem to get carved open quite easily but the underlying stats arent supporting that no 1067 chance hes considered p90 the same as villa so far we havent seen that middle in defense emerge were still waiting to see who it is and when were going to get to defenders we can see we know theres value with robinson at fulham and porro at spurs or maybe romero at spurs whats interesting here wolves are 132 with some tough fixtures they might be worth look and theres a name i want to pick out when we get to defenders who could be a target when the fixtures improve brighton middle in defense at the moment in 10th do you expect them to climb that table because i see you as a more defensive side since the zerby left right theres theres more of a plan i think to deal with theres a plan b when things arent going well to drop back and again i think weve got players who have already bought into the system and there seems to be like quite a lot of cohesion in the way we attack and the way we defend the issue is a little bit that dunc is getting on a bit kadogo is going to come in untested in the in the premier league hes got a great reputation people seem to absolutely love him but hasnt played in the premier league yet weve got hinwood playing a left back his stan should come back but hes been a bit suspect defensively i dont know theres theres a bit of like change and a bit of amendments coming to the brighton backline so would i expect immediate improvements on this probably not but i think it will settle down and we will become good value i think the ver bren and like fleen rotation if youre on a wild card just looks so good i was gonna the end of the season lets get to keepers save that chat till keepers es ban mentioning con got not playing fing he did indeed and he went off i think on about 70 minutes didnt look too serious he wasnt going off shaking his head or head in his hands or anything like that so we do have to wait for the presser for memory so we have to see we have to see whether coner is going to be ready for the weekend but you mentioned the fixtures lets just bring up the fixtures for villa this is the long ticker showing game weeks 4 to 12 and villa are four in that but if we look at the shortterm pictures everton at home wolves at home its swit away doesnt get much better than that does it doesnt but at the same time everton were impressive against bournemouth for 88 minutes jack harrison was looking good cal l had a bit about him they were attacking well and to lose that game is one of the biggest like throwaways i can i can remember because i was watching it a match of today and honestly bournemouth didnt have a highlight until 88th minute there wasnt a single attack of not for bournemouth and then there was like six highlights in a row all bournemouth attacks every cross seemed to cause them problems it was absolute capitulation wasnt it compl complete i watched some everton fan pods afterwards cuz i wallowing in other teams misy and they were just saying you could smell it you could smell it in the ground and like the fear in the players the minute they got one goal and its like ive been there with forest ive seen it i remember the sheffield united semi f in the playoffs when they pulled one back and suddenly you could just sense that all the confidence was going it was only a matter of time for more goals to consider and thats how it was in that game five minutes was crazy it was such an undy like end to the match because the balls were coming in and there was players unmarked on the edge of the area like everton had a breakaway and they tried to attack and then bournemouth won the ball back and pushed and everton werent bringing all their men back like hurridly to defend it wasnt like they were defending with 10 men behind the ball there was like massive pockets of space for bournemouth to attack d must have been i was gonna say tearing his hair out he has got much of that but he must its worrying he worrying whats going on at ev thats for sure lets look at some attacking data and some ofam i just going to say quickly theres theres that game and then its wolves and ip switch and although i think those games look amazing from an attacking perspective and youd expect them to score lots of goals i still think from a defensive perspective everton wolves nips switch isnt as easy as it as it might look on paper not when were talking about derby factor and then the nip switch i think are g to get him because i think whats his name up top dap i can never remember daps name dap up top is going to cause them isses lively and in it switch i think of all the promoted sides are the ones that are going to pose the biggest attacking threat we havent seen it yet which brings me to the attacking date we havent seen it yet and it switch bottom of this table for team dat attack xg non penalty per 90 40 the reason why theyre down there though is because theyve had the toughest opening three fixtures i believe i do believe that we will see more from them but having said that 633 shots per 90 is woeful but the fixtures have been against them so i am interested to see what they do now that the fixtures ease up for them somewhat but no surprise to see it switch and leester down the bottom s anonin 14th 116 more favorable but i think of the three promoter sides its which the one im looking at theyve signed some smart players i think and i think theyve got leaf davis someone who i said leaf there a player that could offer an option in defense in terms of attacking returns and i think theyve got a sprinkling of talent including dap like you mentioned so i expect to see halfway line drove and just banged it in great goal not what youd expect from a promoted striker but he was he was in the championship last season on loan part of the city graduates so you expect him to be quality and hes starting to show it but i think its which will climb this table i dont think theyll climb to the heights and at the very top we see liverpool there who are absolutely dominant what the stat that i pick out here although its 237 non penalty per 90 its the big chances over five big chances per game crazy that that is massive and were expecting that to plateau a little bit but the next two fixtures are good two home games forest with good underlying numbers but youd still expect liverpool to to have chances in that game and then bournemouth at home when harlands away and i think thats what taking me into the realms of thinking i want to get salah in because that bournemouth at home game looks great when harlands got that tricky match and then its who do you captain otherwise because if ive just got harland and sacka as my two premiums i dont want to captain either of them in that match so then im either taking a punt on someone else in five but theres no one i trust at the moment or i go for go for sell what were talking about is the liverpool bank of pies which starts now which is a group of four fixtures which we always wanted to target forest bournemouth wolves away and then palace away and the reason why thats of interest is because in the middle of that harland plays arsenal and then goes to newcastle and newcastle away traditionally one of the hardest away games and he might find it difficult there i me all at the moment hes not finding anything too difficult but you got to say if youre comparing harand to c over this next four you would say that salahs got a good chance of outscoring harand right given that hes kept pace of himself so far they got theyve got identical points at the moment 41 points that is that is that is ridiculous i wasnt expecting that the main reason why i didnt go with him i thought i thought the points might be shared a bit more between liverpool and it turns out they were just all getting them except for bloody j apparently trent how trent hasnt got an attack in return yet i dont know because that offside was salah didnt need to touch that did he and then and then trents getting a double digit in that he could have had an assist in the first game lot of what ifs and maybees but i think hes been genuinely unlucky not to not to come away with more points but you look at this st and think with two home games to come and then wolves and then palace that isnt exactly a bad game the way palace have started you want to be trebling up i think on liverpool in some capacity i think we i mentioned that liverpool becoming maybe more pragmatic under slot but its not detracting from their attack and data its been the perfect start three wins no goal was conceded slot looks confident and we maybe questioned some of his methods in handling man management maybe with trent in particular but theres no theres no question hes getting results and liverpool are that fb points machine we needed them to be with harand so dominant it would have been a pretty tedious start to the season if salah haden have kept pace as he has because then we wouldnt be sitting here even deba whether we go harand because he would be absolutely dominating but the fact that salah with a liverpool team that looks like theyre going to be scoring goals regularly sal is a viable option which is what we need and now we need other players to join that we need we need son to step up when he sacker to step up to rival holland otherwise we just dont want that one player dominating things do we im still im still i did an article for sports casting which you can you can see on my twitter which was i was looking if i was going to wild card this week what route would i go down would i go salah only well no cuz i want i dont think ill be wild carding out harland right now would i go harland only or would i go for both and even though im thinking of getting both in my team this week doing that sacker and esack move i dont like the idea of wild carding and having both just because when you look at what it does to the rest of your side youre stuck having to play three five fives every week and okay those five fives are under arent bad because im looking like min rogers and j pedro for example theyre not a bad three but youre locked in to them so what happens if like a saos light emerges and you want to move and you need to find an extra million from somewhere or you want to get robertson or arsenals fixes turns soon you want to get an arsenal defender you want to get sacker its it becomes very inflexible and things change very quickly in the next few weeks so i think i would still go for just harland if i was walk carding this week and its what put me off doing it in this in this pr bas its funny you changed your your profile image on twitter and its thrown me completely because i saw this article on twitter saying do you want to go sal and harand i thought well thats handy ill have a read of that and then i realized it was written by you and i was i havent read it youre about to pay me thats the best no dont dont think there was a compliment coming because i think i think the biggest thing for me when i look at teams that are and this is one of the big topics at the moment is about you forgoing sacka to bring in salah is its the fact that arsenals fixtures although theyre tough over the spell were looking at here from 4 to 12 theyre like third from bottom on the ticker theyve got spurs and city next and thats whats dragging it down but theres also a bad run from gw nine 10 and 11 when they face liverpool at home newcastle away chelsea away now thats a tough run but in between that sandwiched in between that is in game week six leicester at home and in game week seven s an at home those are probably the two best home fixtures you can have and they get them back to back and even without odard there if he isnt back by then youd still back arsenal to score goals get clean sheets and so if youre moving away from arsenal in order to get money for sa for salah youve got that problem of gw six and seven havent you well i think it pretty much locks me into a wild card in six right doing these moves which i dont think is the worst thing in the world because i want to be able to take advantage of that fixure anyway and probably double up triple up on arsenal over that time but i cant be going into at the moment ive got no arsal defender and i probably well i wont have sacker if i take him out for salah so how am i going to move back to those for six im not going to be able to so i think thats thats going to be a wild card in six for me if and when i go ahead with it because im im going to go ahead with it i think i without an arsenal defender i can absolutely see why doing it because youre you not only are you not going to have sacker youve got to get an aral defender as well for that for that run i get it i think if you did have an arsal defender though if you were in that situation would you be thinking twice about selling sacka because you you are committing the wild card arent you if its just one transfer you could in theory do salah back to sacka and would you do that though when salahs salahs going to wolves and palace wolvves w thats it youre going to be selling sal is away at wolves if i wild card though its probably going to be the same boat because like i said im probably not going to go with harand and salah so then i getting rid of salah away at away at wolves and hes hes cap hes probably the best captain option that week isnt he because like you said harlands got newcastle away so maybe its a case of holding off until seven to walk c sell out when he plays palace away which its still a pretty good fixture but its not as you can catch in saaka surely are you not going to do that youre not going to catch inaka to leicester maybe i dont trust zaka as a captain youre not dont know well you you captained him and got six points his ceiling does feel like its lower than harand for sure i get that but hes a consistent points machine like i have no doubt he will get returns in those two games whether hell get double figures thats the big issue isnt it youd expect him to get at least one if he doesnt get one double digit hall against leester and southampton at home like you said theres two best fixtures you can have its going to be interesting period that because youre going to want all three of those players and you can do it but like i said youre youre youre going to be massively low in other areas of your of your team so youre not thinking of wild card into that scenario i will im not ruling it out but would i wild card into salah har and sacka and trent and then have to with all the all the low all the other dr that im going to have to have in my side thats not even take into account palmer for example whos got brighton at home in six and then forest at home in seven two home games for him hes incredible at home last season its a its a real dilemma it is and i think were sitting here in game week three or four and its like are we confident enough that we know the where the value is like we can get to midfielders in a bit and we look at min seeno there are players there that you think well they can at a 55 fulfill the role of enablers to get me to a place where i could get those big hitters in but were only three game weeks in and so like you say someone could yet emerge as a major bandwagon that we want to move to and then youre youre cut off from making that without making multiple transfers so it is it is early well the other option is you dont go for sack and you go for have up top and if youve got isack for example well isack in six has got man city so that feels like a good time to he then immediately goes into everton off the back of that but maybe thats if you cant move for sack because you dont want to lose your c and harland maybe thats the way you attack those two because up to now havs has been outscoring sea so might not happen carry on happening but at the moment you could back you could have a go but not having sacker for leicester and southampton at home is a worry youre going to be especially after what i saw against brian because like you said he could have hold in that he just sometimes finds a way not to get all the points that he deserves but what i will say is were gonna touch on the impact that od guards absence could have on arsenal and sacka later in the show and maybe thats a factor havitz has been playing up front and hes not you dont think hes going to be with odard out its whether or not odard is back for gw six and seven which he could be and we just weve yet to hear the length of the injury were thinking three weeks could be a month right thats what thats what the talk is but not been confirmed as yet well get on to that in a bit lets look at goalkeepers low so i was going to ask you about for buan because were waiting for four or five option to stand out because at the moment the heavy hit of goalkeepers and say that mildy because theyre five5 so its not a big outlay at the moment its still allison and ryer out on top and it looks like if you went and spent the money thats been well spent at the moment but were braced for a four five to break through and when they do that could be where you save and when people wild card in six maybe by then theres enough confidence in a four five to move there it could be fleen with great fixtures for brenford for example but youve also mentioned for buen and youve also mentioned the rotation between the two of them put my neck on the line a little bit last time we one of these when i said the br was going to reclaim that spot from still i didnt expecting him to get a bloody low move but luckily he came straight back into the side i do like for bren i like him as a goalkeeper i like i said i do think brightons defense in the medium to long term will improve the trouble is you want him for the next two because thats when we got two good home fixtures and im not sure what happens in those i think we should keep at least one clean sheet across those but i wouldnt be too surprised if we conceded in both but if you if you go over to the fixtures quickly ver bren and fleen have got just an unbelievable rotation you would bring in ver bran playing this week for i switch and forest and then youd play fleen for west ham and wolves you can also then play him in man utd as well which is an awful brighton got newcastle away and they always find a way to beat us so id probably stick with fleen in that one but then you play for bren with wolves at home and then you move back to fleen and you have full bournemouth and everton so the toughest fixture from now right up until gw 12 is that decision between man utd or newcastle the rest is as good as it gets i think the only thing with that is if youre planning on doing it a bit later you dont need for bren because you can just keep fleen so im im seeing teams wild carded with just fleen f the next two are rough and youre probably not going to get clean sheet either of those but then from then youve saved the0 five and you can just play flicking across the board but if i was doing it right now i think id go with both id counter it as well by saying youre spending 9m on a keeper there youre getting two four fs and you can get for nine five for an extra not five you could get ry or allison right so its like the degrees of savings youre getting then goes down and then youve always got to get the rotation right whereas you can just stick ry and allison in and then forget about it so its whether that not five is going to be worth it and it im im a big advocate of saving money and team value so theres no question it could be at some point i think at the moment again its its too early for us to know which is the best route to go but flecken from six looks very good and he will be the goto for wild cards at that point theres no question just because of the fixtures but also 17 saves made so far he hasnt kept the clean sheet theyve conceded four goals in three games which isnt terrible but 17 saves is by far in away the most saves on show here so flein is what we knew he was some someone who makes saves a lot of saves in a game as a result any bonus yet because whats interesting is no keepers kept no keepers got any bonus without keeping a clean sheet as yet which is what we expected because of the anywh near nowhere near no so youre not fleen might get you save points but dont expect that to be coupled with a bonus point here and there because it doesnt look like its going to happen this season and the flip side of that is that ray has been fortunate in that they have conceded shots hes made 10 saves and in the two clean sheets that hes kept hes got an average of two bonus points so youve got to keep clean sheets to get bonus as a keeper it seems the boat its still cheaper to go with the two four fs than go for ray and a four so youre still saving a bit of money there and you then pair it with a gabrielle or a cba to cover the arsenal defense and you could bench them for the next two if you dont think theyre going to keep if you think theyre going to concede and then bring them in i think allisons at still a nogo though because i still think you want to keep that third liverpool spot available so its ray its ray or well its ray the rotation or just flecken i think theyre your three options i wouldnt be going near anyone else and i think were going to see the movement towards fleen but i dont im not going to sell rare i dont think maybe i might do on the wild card depending on when that comes out but at the moment im going to hold tight and see if a 4 five a strong four five does a m so its questionable whether brenford ed those fixtures it is an incredible run though and so fleen id expect fleen to emerge but well see well see how it turns out pford miserable 24th look at that its just been 10 goals conceded he has made nine saves so he could yet be a four well he could yet be i was goingon to say 4 five hes not he was five million which he stacked against him hes gone down to 49 as a result of the start hes had dont see him being a factor in our season at all grog day isnt it from last season exactly what we said last year they conceded loads of goals in the first few weeks he looked absolutely dreadful people wild carded him out got rid of him and then d got them playing and turn turned around but they theres nothing positive the only thing positive about evon was that they should have been outside they honestly should have been five nil up i think in that game against bournemouth i thought they were brilliant particularly in the first half but then pf pford made a mistake hes i think that might even be the second one hes hes been hes because it was against spurs wasnt it he did the clanger for son just took off his t knocked him another one in this and when youve got one of your star players doing that youve you just ask him for trouble so they need to massively turn it around but i just dont see it for now d has either got well it will turn i d would be gone because he cant keep losing games by this margin so hes got a turn for them i me well see maybe pitford can do what he did last season it should help us yes absolutely hes a key player isnt he defenders trent reigning supreme 067 next y on penalty per 90 ahead of the pack the chasing pack as it stands here are coleman milinkovic and sigar santom its not going to stay like that those three will drop away its just because of the sample size trent wont drop away though trent will be there all season i think do you remember coleman back in the back in the glory days moring i remember going for bain over coleman and it was an absolute disaster that was a debate wasnt it baines over coleman the answer was both i think but i remember coleman out coleman outscored him was toward the end of banes like legacy coleman was a great asset though i loved it but hes not gonna stay hes not gonna stay this list trent is hes hes gonna hit a massive hole soon im sure he is hes gonna hes gonna hit a i dont know 12 13 pointer and i think it could well be in the next two weeks against one of these two teams at home so if youre wild card in six youre keeping trent i cant see unless slot drops him or it looks like hes massively falling out of favor or gets injured i cant see losing trent can you i think hes just hes gonna get close to 200 points for seven million in a defensive slot i see it that way i just i just think that itll take one big hall and then well see huge bandwagon i think it just hasnt arrived as yet british 87 saying is it no its nica saying suara suar suara wont drop he has got a very good that cant be right ita yeaha siga he has got a good reputation going forward and the numbers here may be sustainable the only reason why i think hell drop is because sampton as an attacking team wont allow him to sustain that he has got he has got the goal of course already and maybe there could be potential there as a four five box but i dont know ever play ever gonna play him well unless hes going to emerge as elaf davis threat and because i do see him as being a four five and hes down in 18th in this table with 013 x on p 90 well below sara but i expect i expect davis to climb that table as soon as it richs fixtures soften up so he for me still the one that i would go with if i was going to look for a four five from a promoted team of course romero and porro pretty solid id expect them to remain near this near this area certainly porro were not going to go for spurs for clean sheets all season but porro is a player thats still hanging on in a lot of teams probably will remain in my team for now porro for robertson is what im looking at robertson is 026 somewhat behind trent now do you think theres an argument there do you think the million gap can be bridged what him and trent no i think sometimes youve got to pick your battles when youre trying to cost cut and i just think trents got so much more to his game than robertson than robertson has is robertson six was he six5 hes six isnt he same as same as van d six okay so because it was that van was the cheapest wasnt it and then robinson was like one step up and then trent was the thing so hes id definitely go for him over van dijk but i id find the extra id find the extra million for trent i just i just think trent is nonnegotiable for me he would he would be just be the first player in my in my team i think you could even build a case for not going with harand like you have not going with salah anyone else i just if i see a team without trent i just think youre risking youre risking it here that is that is a seven million asset taking up a spot that you have to play a player in whos gonna hit a massive hole at some point to too much seventh eight nor 027 hes the one that could emerge when the fixtures get better for walls but they dont get better for a long time its newcastle and villa next home villa away then liverpool then brenford away then city its dreadful that not until you cant say brighton away is eas so you got to get to game week 10 you you say and is on even going to be in charge by then i hope so but if they lose every game up until gw 10 then theres going to be questions asked isnt there so eight nory could be someone we look at because these numbers are impressive shots per 9 172 chan cre 129 hes played left wing back now in a back three which i think will be the preferred system while they ride out these tough fixtures so he will he will remain in this top 10 i think and hell be someone well look at should oneal be there and theyre still playing wing backs and then i want to talk about lewis and viio because vs crept in no honestly vs crept he wasnt in this table last week but hes crept in after more attacking display 22 theyre vs the goto if you want security but theyre by far and away the city options arent they at the moment lewis is the interesting one of what you do again if youre on a wild card what you do with that cardio had an xgi of 055 that was mostly from i think one good chance that he that he created hes still not the marauding asset that we that we wanted and when youve got lewis there at 47 hes very attractive you need to have a bench that covers it if youre wild carding i you go safe and you pick like a dunk or mikeno see theres gavves now formul in and face so you can get rid of your ben johnsons and your barcos and not have to worry too much about it but i still want a bit more data on lewis i still want to see a couple games this arsenal games thats coming up is going to be massive because if lewis starts in that then and plays 90 again and then youve got five weeks have been playing 90 and he started the most important game one of the most important games they couldna have all season then clearly hes got that sewn up but walkers lurking foden back in training and lurking around i think i would punt on him but id want to give it a couple more weeks but you must be loving having you got little price rise out of well up to 47 got a couple of them got a couple out of him that was the gamble like i bought him for one game and hoped he would play well enough to keep his place he was impressive for england as well i just y he hasnt put a foot wrong yet so but we know pep like he could let him down but the way hes talking about him i think that hes there now i think i think hell have a place in that side i dont know what that means for walker whether walker gets europe well have to see and thats what we want the answers on and thatll be the case very soon niik williams in 11 seen a few mentions of him in chat the only query there he is far forward shots per 90 233 chances created one per 90 been an impressive starts the season for williams that weve had easy fixtures what i would say is moreno has been bought he could go at left back and ana could then get right back ana for me is a superior defender to williams and i think hes good enough going forward as well so nico not nailed long term so beware if youre thinking of doing that i wouldnt do that and well when we get our draft video out of our of our bickering weve got moreno there you assured me with as much vigor as i did with barco that moreno was gonna ask was gonna ask williams from the side so im expecting moreno to be in very soon and williams to be out or i will be very no i think i think maro will start its a different his quality going forward is strong neither williams or ana can offer that and i think we need that side because it does unlock h ado more to have a natural eff foot or outside him because at the moment we got a problem where we the fullback doesnt go around k h ador and hao wants to come inside so we dont have that threat around to overlap him so moro gives us that so you can see the logic know i think id get moreno i love i love watching moreno play if hes is he nailed down like a moring fullback role for a as weve seen a good defensive side under nuno in terms of the stats he could be an absolute steel at four five if we if we keep the good defensive data going through tougher fixtures so this is a good test for us now we go to liverpool and then weve got an easy game at brighton but after that he does s up youre going youre going to that im going to that looking forward to it but we cant do it again we cannot do the game what are you doing now what you going im in madrid im in madrid and i messed it up i think because when we were thinking of dates i had the forest game in mind but i put forest in the wrong week on the calendar id put it for this week coming forward so im im going to the ip switch game on saturday but i thought that was the forest game i know ab well last year you had already had plans concert want to see pay you cant turn that down they might not be play might not be alive much longer let playing the music so have to go to the city grounds in the new year weve got to do it because we keep threatening to do a vlog while were there as well and will enjoy that we do a live stream after ridiculous we havent got gone but absolutely well talk about ben white just down there in 45th he is aead of anthony robinson whos been the star for many fb teams so far this season but ben white hasnt created a single chance yet nothing from him so expect that to pi to pick up but not justifying the price tag at the moment for ben go cra id still go cra no fair enough lets look at mids h on whoa theres a play where do you want me to go where do you want me to go we have to talk bright defender lucas dean you dont want to go there if youre gonna talk people in the g luca dean you are and you me unless i mention luca dean even if its to say dont go there ive put him on there but if youre gonna chat people up into going luca dean youre asking for trouble after what you did to start the season no im im going to do the complete opposite im going to say that for anyone who might be newer to fantasy football or whoever who isnt quite familiar with lucaon to me he is the number one worst troll in fpl there it is there he is there is no one more of a i remember starting with him a few seasons ago and his underlying stats are good he got like blank and then scored own goal and then they conceded in like in like the 90th minute i think he scored an own goal and that is owning luca de he can be as good as you want he can have all the great stats great fixtures for villa i promise you bring him in youll regret it dont go there thats thats my thats my happ next big hall coming big hall coming for because hes thats what he does when you think hes hes gonna do well he doesnt whenever you think hes gonna do badly hes hilarious because he find he finds different ways each time and they get more bizarre by the minute dont they like hell get booked in the last minute when hes just about to get free bonus he crazy honest never known ive never known a player so consistently troll people who go there its unbelievable darwins getting there but well to be fair darwin is darwin and dean right up there midfielders you have to have one start to appear on this table which is why gacho is right at the top but hes only had 124 minutes a very small sample he exra on penalties is 119 hes right at the top of all midfielders but then like this week we get to the quality sorry was as i like g this week theres no question hes a good player hes not going to be number one for xg on penalty over the season he is going to drop down but i expect him to be there or thereabouts in the 30 for sure salah will probably be top in his table for most of the season hes there one extra non penalty per 90 at the moment and then diaz 094 de br a 093 diaz incredibly high and i want to bring up weve got our key performance indicators so ive got those again i just want to bring them up again because so this table is showing midfielders this season who have improved on their xg non penalty per 90 compared to last season gacho right at the top 079 we go down to diaz though so hes improved his xg non penalty per 90 by 037 but if you look across hes also improved his shots in the box per 90 by 022 n9 and his chances created by 90 by 060 so diaz at the moment even though its a small sample weve got a combination of the ey test and this data to suggest that diaz unders slot is a different player now it is too early we cant jump to conclusions but how much longer do you leave it before you have to start thinking diaz has to be in our teams well again to talk about the draft because that was window into what we were thinking we were we had a brief discussion didnt we about whether to draft jur or diaz because we could have had either i think it was our it our third pick wasnt it we could have had either and in the end we both agreed that diaz was the one to go for and at the start of the season i think we both would have said i went for jotter over diaz js our biggest fan but you were you also whal about diaz but i think we both probably would have picked y but its been a couple of weeks the itest supports diaz as the stats support diaz as well youve got that slight worried about the international minutes this week the fact darwin hasnt traveled anywhere i do wonder if hes going to give him a chance in the team over diaz but the way diaz has been playing be a bit risky wouldnt it to i think diaz starts he might only get an hour but i think he starts i just think hes just won all three games scoring goals diaz is on fire and i watched him i watched him in the in the internationals i watched him play for columbia against argentina he didnt he didnt sparkle to be fair so i was i was just interested to see how he perform in that but he has its just the positions hes taken up for liverpool that he is hitting that narrative that he would get more central he would get more far post and the cross is coming over from trent and salah thats where the creativity is all that side its all right side isnt it right salah their most creative player after trent and then you got soso that side as well so we did say like if the service is going to come in it does seem that js not being that big number nine getting on the end of stuff its diaz coming far post get on the end of it is j gonna become the new firmino who drops back still does all right but its manet and cah who were the ones back then and i think i said before the manchest united game i didnt think diaz has the potential to score as many goals as man did but two well taken goals against man utd two different types of goal as well and the counterattack goal he scored the week before that so hes scoring all different types of goals getting into the right areas like we keep saying stats are good everything you hes hes one to back i think because theres no real reason why that should digine decline youd think if hes still getting the chances hopefully that would improve and hed carry on doing well because hes clearly in the elite talent its just amazing that like gordon was so heavily linked wasnt he with liverpool and i think if gordon had signed i dont know how close they were signing gord if that had gone through i wonder if diaz would even be at the club right now because you presume hes going to play left side right you think so he not gordon coming to take salahs place would he so theyre paying 75m orever it was for gordon that could have been complete nonsense and maybe they were never in for gordon but there was a lot of rumors about it maybe agents al for contract maybe lets all back to b because he was unlucky at west ham disable luke williams bought him and was was waxing liverpol about how hes gone maverick again and he was unfortunate not to get return the in that game and but he stands out well here does he 023 is xgi up per 90 compared to last season interesting chances created a down 062 so hes not that creative force yet but shots are up 082 so hes being more direct fre game small sample etc de bry never going to be a factor foden coming back puts a shadow over it right did you see that interview he did about his pace in the news ea sports fc game hes hes been given 67 pace and he got his fifa card he looked and he was like think they must have red me when i was on crutches last season which i thought was very good i hope so foden is an interesting one isnt he because if lewis continues in that central midfield spot and walker doesnt come back foden its ridiculous to think the player of the season last year might struggle to find his way back into the team but city have looks so effective in those first few games that does foden automatically come straight back into the side probably but causes a bit of disruption to the way the way s been playing if things are as they are now i think de bruyne is a good option going in from game week seven because the fixures if you go back to the fixures for man city after that arsenal man and newcastle game were out the way full and wolf southampton bournemouth its a brilliant run of four games so we might be looking to pair har up with someone for those and if foden isnt in the picture then de bruyne is the next best option because you would trust anyone else im looking at that period when im going to play my w im not sure at the moment im thinking maybe between seven and eight which is the next international break and game week eight is when im probably gna have to get on a city player because i can i can maybe captain salah or sacka until then because sacks got saned at home game week seven when harand faces fulham so maybe i can i can play my sacker against your harland but certainly after that when harland goes to wall s anon b with if im not getting harland surely ive got to get some city attack there and i need foden to be back otherwise youre right maybe it will be maybe well be looking at at de bruyne and he hes showing hes showing a different player so far but its its free matches well see if that continues i wanted to mention matoma here as well because hes hes increased his extra on penalty per 90 by 018 his other factors are all down though touches in the box are down shots per 90 down as are shots in the box hes getting some traffic this week because of the fixtures where you stand on him well i was i was all in on him before this week i had my transfers planned before the i was ring watkins in for esack and i was going to ring matoma in for gordon i was pretty locked in on that and then i saw what happened with salah and i saw what happened with j pedro as well getting a getting that goal and getting another 90 and also the fact he wasnt supposed to be going on international duty and then gets bloody co up anyway because of because of an injury but well talk about him when the forwards come around it put me off mat a bit theres m there as well for a little bit cheaper but i do like the matoma pick and i think his i think particularly against ip switch i think he could do well in that game because hes got im sure most people listening to this have seen matoma play but hes an incredibly like talented and tricky player but hes got one move which just is so effective against weaker oppos opposition which is he gets the ball just outside the area he brings it to a complete stop and then he just kicks it far past the defender and just runs onto it and then just centers it into the into the penalty area and ill tell you that is going to cause whos it going to be a right back ben johnson or whoever is playing youd think ben johnson hes gonna hes gonna ruin the right back with that rip switch i just think him against newly promoted teams is going to be so effective because he was getting some joy in other games this season not so muchal well exactly against ashy l absolutely terrorized him so when hes playing against a maybe a less adapt right back hes going to be very effective the touch in the box for 90 is a bit concerning minus three on that but the ex number 90 is a bit higher because i think thats being thats been quite affected all for him like its interesting salah is the only big hitter here amongst the midfielders you look up the list and brunos up there so hes 84 and he has improved 027 improvement on his extra on penalty per 90 which could be of interest could be enough for people to hold him for one more week but salahs in there so salahs xg on penalty is up as are his touches in the box per 90s so and he shots in the box per 90s so the key performance indicators are shown that salah hes not in decline its going almost the what you make of his what do you make of his comments after the match because they they said to him whats happening with the contract or whatever and he said didnt he this is my last year at liverpool and i just want to enjoy it i dont know whether that is bluster to see if we what they can offer i dont think its going to affect him people have said do you think hes going to like simmer down as the season goes on as hes winding down and is he off to saudi that would be the most likely out come i think i think liverpool are going to be talking arent theyre going to be thinking hes going to be going i think hes going to continue to prove to be someone who can be elite i dont see him declining as yet and slot seems to be getting the best out of him so far and hes super fit so he can carry on playing in the premier league theres no question its whether or not he there desires of stays there i dont know its interesting isnt it and they got van dijk on the last year as well and there was speculation about trent so so is this the end of an era and are liverpool going to go full tilt for the title because of that is it going to be a motivational factor i dont know it is interesting to that i dont think thats gonna impact fbl at the moment though theres no sign of that its just sometimes when youve got these contracts i look at tony last season he just went completely off the boil didnt he i me was do you remember aubameyang when he signed a new contract and he didnt score for like an entire season as well so you can make as many narratives as you want about it but the fact is there is this thing going on with salah he said its his last year and he started the season maybe even better than he started any of the last couple of years if you were playing top trumps and the top trump category was professionalism and you had salah aubameyang and tony who would have professionalism very good very good point so i think its a different fish isnt it salahs not someone whos gonna i dont know hes hes not gonna let perform think that about aubameyang at the time though wasnt he and hed been scoring 20ish goals and got the goals in the fa cup and he was like the talisman of the side i dont know what happened with that and now all the stuff happened with chelsea and at barcelona his reputations in the mud but at the time it seemed when they gave him that they give like a fiveyear deal it seemed like that was a good bit of business i want people to invent top trumps with professionalism for footballism who be top who be top of your professional harry kane maybe i dont know is he professional i think he is given how long he stayed at spurs out winning anything thats true theres a lots of comments about bourou midfielders why would you buy too seeno toer were sleeping on toer says neils apples wow lots of the number of b is tavir so im having a bad night with pronunciation are the number of bourn midfielders that are featuring on this table and the table were going to go back to is quite extraordinary sinister tavanir seeno rutar i got that right see i got all those right can do it when i concentrate so theyre all in this table theyre all improved on last season and if we go back to the midfielders table youll see that theyre all there as well theyre all up there in the in the top echelons of this table for xg non penalty per 90 bournemouth as we saw with the attacking date if we go back to that were third i think third 195 of the season so what do you put that down to is it the fixures havent been that easy theyre showing red there do you think that we need to start taking them seriously as a source of value because seeno has been the one thats jumped out so far but maybe hes that it doesnt stop there maybe tavanir could be an option they have played everton thats always a slight boost to those more i thought i thought theyd struggle more i thought theyd be i like i like bournemouth as a as a unit i like the manager as well and i think he did great things with them i thought losing slanky though would be big adjustment period bigger than we thought but they did have simino who last season stepped up with the goals been eight goals to him four assists across last season so thats the difference between him and taver is taver never got anywhere near those numbers i think he got about half or maybe even less of the attacking returns probably like five or six attacking returns last season whereas sea now looks like hes moving up even more i like him at 55 i think hes an option and i think again when we talk about going for h and going for salah having to play three five fivs i think rogers seeno and pedro is a pretty decent three who were all underpriced i was looking at how i could wild c now and get to salah harland and it would involve dropping down to a soeno from sun but i looked at it and thought what does that feel like it is a big drop because of the historical the legacy that son has got in fbl hes an elite player no question almost describable as a heavy hitter he has been in other seasons but seeno when we talked about diaz as a player who could be exceed in his value seeno definitely fits into that bracket as well and its its just how long we wait before we start going we got to take this seriously hes definitely hes definitely providing what we hope rogers would at the moment and i dont know if thats gonna stop and evan nilson has arrived for bournemouth but he doesnt strike me as a player whos gonna cil seenos attacking verve so to speak hes had so many shots he look up for it as well like when just before it all turned for everton simenia was involved in a altercation he was he was fired up he wasnt giving up that game despite the fact they were two two down so i like that fire about him and the fixures are good chelsea at home former for would have chance in that they beat them last year didnt they cant if it was at sanford br or if it was if it was at their ground but they definitely they definitely beat quite early in the season but then its liverpool then southampton and leicester so got that little they b theyre bott of the ticket from game four for 12 so out of this run theyve got two very strong blue fixtures its the southampton leicester double up that arsenal have also got they do have liverpool arsenal villa away city brenford away brighton at home its tough it is the toughest run on here so you can be forgiven for ignoring seeno at the moment because of those fixtures but we might be sleeping on him we might if you if youve got the ability to bench him in against liverpool and against arsenal and then you probably look to take him out after the run but that still gives you three good fixures i think to make that strategy of going with the premiums more viable because when youve got min smith rogers and him and then pedro thats five all under six million we have weve never had that before people saying that the move to embo has got to come it has got to come i think hes 15th in his table hes got three goals already in 269 minutes 63 extra on p think it will stay there he hasnt had a pen yet but that will be did you see did you see the southampton highlights yes suicide its exactly what i said at the start of the season didnt i said martins not going to change and they havent the thing is they havent its like burnley they dont have the quality to play in that way at this level so i do worry dont get me wrong i think emba is a great pick and i think hes going to be probably a must from game week six onwards but i just wouldnt take anything from that southampton game because i they were just it was comical genuinely comical how they were playing the mistakes they were making the invitation for the press against one of the best pressing sides in the league as well why are you messing around passing the ball out from the back like get rid of it i know no one wants to hear people say that i said got howard bellis is a good player but bednar jack stevens theyre not theyre not good strong premier league defenders who are good with the ball at their feet i would theyre okay theyre not theyre not necessarily poor defenders but i wouldnt associate them with being players who are press resistant right so and i remember when martin b swansea does a city ground we were just catching them and they wouldnt change he just carried on letting us do it and thats what i fear that could happen to s anon i hope not because i dont want the promoted scenes to go down but what i saw at brenford was what i thought would happen whether or not martin does start going a bit more direct he can change because he has done he got the team up by changing the approach in the playoffs so well see what happens next but they cant do that he wont have an easier game all season in aumo to get two goals sure it was just ridiculous but hes a quality player theres no question if youre wild card in six which youve talked about what are you doing about brenford are you going in bumo you probably have to dont you the fixtures are so good and he is the best asset from that side so you probably you probably go at least one defender and then bumo go a defender would you i think you fleen you got youve got vanderberg havent you were hoping that he comes in if you got a four million asset with the fixtures theyve got that again frees up a bit of money to do what you want with other areas hes a good player i think he will get in i think hes too good not to get in that side what who he comes in for would be the question but another player i want to mention just so that we can clip this and say look we did mention him i told you jack gish i think or delete it b i ignore what im about to say if he does nothing for the next if he does score next week then its all down to us want the credit the numbers suggesting and what were seeing playing for england as well greish could be turning the tide a bit hes only had 91 minutes and the numbers are up do you think theres a chance that we could start seeing somewhat the jack gish we saw at villa no you dont see it no because why would he suddenly change the what hes he won the treble playing in a certain way which was his best fpl season for city and it wasnt that great it wasnt like we were all i think he was in my team for a bit and he got a couple of returns but he never looked like someone getting 15 20 attacking returns in that season lets be honest its not going to get any better than that for him is it that was him playing 90 minutes almost every week for a treble winning side this is him barely in the side with more competition n not gonna happen its interesting talking about ian right was talking about for england saying that to stay in carys thinking hes got to be playing for city and hes been hes done the two seasons now hes a hes not a veteran at city but hes certainly a senior player there now its staying in that team will he be able to do enough and what role will he continue to play the role where he is hes effectively being the magnet for defense so they can create space which is what hes been there hes not been its not been about output for greish its been about sacrificing his own output for the gains of the team i just wonder whether thats going to change because pep what pep will do which all good managers do is theyll change the way they play they cant keep playing the same way and theyll theyll reinvent players within system and so i just wonder whether theres something worth keeping an eye on im not saying its going to turn into output yet but i think its its worth certainly when foden is back and we start to see what peps gonna do and whether or not he is going to change things up whether greish becomes a different type of greish id rather id rather pick doco at the moment i think hes just i think even if greish plays were still not sure hes just going to get the ball recycle it and everything oras at least if you get 45 minutes from do hes going to go we remember we i think was it last season we were like guos gone out and bought dau who was greish from when he was a villa that tricky winger well see we cant judge city until theyre back to full strength until rod is there until fodens there and thats thats what well see but i just want to keep an eye on and just thought id mention it because its always nice then go we didnt mention him mention another 10 players and one of thems going to come in surely so is talk about sacka and odard then because sacka has this table 13th 072 odard could be out for a while premier league put this up this is based this is completely ripped off a premier league article but i feel like put format so exactly well i had to do that because it was so blurry and hard to read on their format plus of course they did miss off shots per 90 even though they mentioned in the article so that was a bit slack of them terrible standards so i had to put shots for 90 in there now ive highlighted the key stats the point points per 90 the arsenal gain with odard 21 and its 17 without odard so not a major drop but a drop nonetheless with odard starting shots per 90 go down from 159 to 133 and goals per 90 go down from 209 to 163 so thats the biggest drop the win percentage as well as worth talking about there 66 win rate with odard 52 without him now i look at this think yes theres a drop but then you look below the pink bar there and you look at possession you look at pass the final third passing accuracy passing accuracy oppositions half no difference no difference to that whatsoever so it doesnt affect their pattern of play without him it does affect their results but that could be down to were talking about 19 matches with that could purely be down to the opposition right it could be down to so i dont look at this and think its disastrous for arsenal like many people are saying do you my bigger worry is what we touched on earlier which is having to move havs back and playing a false nine system with trossard i think this is this is where everyone thought arsenal would go out and get a striker this time and jays had a pretty good preseason i think a lot of trust was put in him im still im still not convinced hes hes the one to be leading the title charge for them for them up front although i did think that about hz and hes hes stepped up havs is so effective at the moment that taking him away from that role is what worries me so its going to be what hav parte and who else is going to be in the midfield h parte and because rice is out guards out geino gonna come in could do a bit of a crappy midfield isnt it they got sterling right we havent talked about him is he gonna be a factor he could go he could go up would he go false nine over trossard im not going to go im not going to start the sterling false 9 prop my point is that theyre playing spurs next its a massive game for them spurs will surely be looking at that midfield and thinking we can for the first time we can dominate that mids we can dominate that midfield dominate a big word i think or get at them hs parans and who you who did you just say georgino georgino is not bad is either but i think i do think that he going to stifle the amount of amount of chances they get in that game and it is spurs theyre going to be leaky but i think they might be relying on more of a from a corner like that where spurs are weak from corners and theyve got gabrielle and celba i dont know how many open play goals or how many chances theyre going to create with that with that midfield mr greg is a regular hello greg hes reminded us that martin and have a sacka trossard they can get some goals i totally agree so what im going to show some more dat lets lets show some more data first this is this is totally ripped off i just rip people off should put this off an opto analyst i do go to the trouble of finding his stuff and researching and reading the article so thank you opter analyst for this stuff this is number of involvements in open play shot ending sequences which i love as a stat so its a events that are leading to either a chance created a shot on goal or a shot ending sequence so hes played a part hes made a pass in a sequence thats ended in a shot hes the top midfielder in the premier league last season for that so that goes against what i said about two minutes ago where arsenal miss him so much this would indicate that they would but i will say also look whos third sacka right so they have got someone there who can take that up and fill that void to some extent its not like theyre not going to create chances about odard there because theyve got an elite player in sacka of course but that is significant you would say theres no question they will miss him deck and rice could arguably be an even bigger miss so we dont know what were going to get from arsenal in this game im gna show you one more graphic again for mto analyst and this i think if you if you were to ask arsenal fans who the one player they would want to not be out of this game its between rice sacker and odard but i think it would be odard i think hes the worst player they could lose for this the captain like the fact the impact has other positions in the team the way he started the season has been impressive bad no im not im not questioning that and then this adds more field to the fire this is the chances created by sacka and odard as a pairing when they fed each other for shots and their combination which i think is 46 chances between them is the biggest of any pairing in the premier league last season wow didnt know that nicely plagarized mark i know so if theres a if theres a narrative to say well sacka would be fine with odard well this suggests that its a big blow to him because as a pairing theyre incredibly effective good news for me as a as a probable seller of sacka this week i cant i cant make a strong case for saying its not gna have an impact the only thing i would say is that what arsenal and man city have in common is theyre going to drive each other in every game this season there is no question arsenal and man city will go into every game and play every minute as if theyve got to win that game there are no games that arsenal or city are going to play where its one all with five minutes to go where theyre not going to go all out to win it now im not saying you would think well thats the case of any team i dont think so i think the intensity in which city and arsenal play and fight for every point to the very last minute is higher than any other teams in the league maybe liverpool will get there this season but the reason why theyre top two is because theyre driven by managers you will create that arsenal will go to spurs regardless of their lineup and they will expect to win and they will fight to win to the final whistle so theres no way that spurs are going to roll them over twonil there is no way if arsenal lose it will be 32 43 ridiculous i dont think arsenal will lose i think theyll still win the game so i still think arsenal will score more than one goal possibly two maybe three even without odard and rice because their desire to win every game to win this title and this season theyve probably got more chance than any and less od guards out for ages well carry them through i think and therefore if i think arsenal are going to do that theyre going to win the game theyre g to score at least two goals im not selling sacker i think sps are goingon to win do you i think spurs are gonna win it i think again you talk about drive and all that i think theyre going to look at this and think were not going to get a better chance were not going to get a better chance in the next few years to beat ar to beat arsenal the fact its a home game as well early in the season put a dent in their title charge right now theres no bigger motivation for spurs theyre not as good a team but with the with the missing players for arsenal its a lot more even i think that its be a good game but i just think what ive seen from arsenals artetta is they find a way now and i think that theyre growing as that team all the time and i think that these are major blows theres no question and theyve got europe and then theyve got city its a tough period for them to lose declan rice in this one game but also oar to injury no question i think it is being overplayed in that people are going morenos out and so on its like theyre not even in the team yet cury is not in the team and you those four names are being mentioned arsenal are going to be without these four key players hold on a minute two of them havent even played yet so people want to build this narrative up that theyre absolutely crippled by injury theyve lost two major key players no question but i still think theyre going to win that game and thats why i think that im okay holding sacka i wouldnt wouldnt i wouldnt not endorse going sacka to sell out i see the logic in it but i wouldnt be surprised if saaka still comes through and get something out of that game because arsenal i think will still win it im expecting im expecting him to get something from the game but i dont think its i would be a lot more worried when i saw rigar go off i that made my mind up that sack was going to go i think before that happened i was looking at spending the money because id already done esack to to pedro so because i thought there was going to be a double a price drop for eack and a price rise i got the price rise but not the price drop but then i was looking at other things i could spend the money on rather than getting rid of sacka because i thought i can keep him play him against spurs but once odard got off i thought now thats thats just one thats just an extra incentive now to take a punt on him not delivering him next two it just feeds into the narrative though if sck returning that game last season and if he does you can just see people go but then the odard injury convinced me theyll say as black box presenting all those numbers partnership true i there need to support selling sacka to go sell and i absolutely see that its of course its logical sells got great fixures sacks in a team without two key players with tough fixures absolutely makes sense the only question i would ask is do you think arsenal can win at spurs i think can so if theyre going to win at spurs sacks got a good chance youve done well youve played both sides like a ab ive nailed my colors to the to the sicker out mast and here you are genius this is how you get away with this stuff and i dont genius i know years of experience doing this stuff lets talk about forwards its a shame about havs because my tactic ahead of gw six is going to be and hopefully still can be isaac to hav just as you say because i want to get on i want to go treble arsenal and if im not wild carding then ill i plan to save two transfers going into six and get inmo and havocs at that point so if oars out that could that could dampen my enthusiasm for but hes here hes ninth in the table 053 hes got two goals one assist its been a good start for your favorite sunday league player as hes hes started i was definitely put off by the positional reclassification a mid moving to a forward and he needed to do what hes been doing and hes been very effective in it if youve got him you still you still play him dont you i dont think hes a hes a cell he can still do damage from the eight position thats the position where i wanted to see him last season and i didnt think he could make it in that in that nine because wed seen him at chelsea playing across all different positions and not nailing his own he started off from the wing for them didnt he and then moved a bit more central then dropped back and never made any position his own well hes definitely made that nine position his own and i think going into going into those games against southampton and leicester you want sacka you want to pair another attacker i think for those two it has to be habt especially now od got out agree harlem we dont need to talk about the only thing i would say about harland is 71 accuracy 50 conversion that will regress there is no question he cant maintain that whether that means that hes going to have significant regression of xg on penalty i dont know were expect it to come down somewhat but itll hover around where it is now 105 but he wont get 1372 90 so that will start coming down i hope he had another good chance though that west had four could had four in that game and i have never when we talk about players going back toback hatrick and regressing ive never been less convinced about regression than i am talking aboutand because brf at home as well it wouldnt be completely out of the realms of possibility if he got a hattrick of hat tricks what i can as someone who would go into harand without harland again is that frank thomas frank is a shrewd tactical manager brenford are a team who will play fre at the back and they do have physical presence at the back and i think that i think that theyll do enough to keep him down to maybe one goal thats what i hope b brenford aren a bad side away from home theyre not going to get skittled three or four nil i dont think and also after international break we often see some drop off clip that not the greish nonsense if i offered you if i offered you a forest onenil win for a harland hattrick would you take it yes of course its a forest one anfield of course i would im forest first fbl second but be like sal captain three million rank be a bit of me like that i was three million this time last year in the world and didnt there so id take it for a one0 forest for sure harlem will aggress because that conversion rate that accuracy is not going to continue but like i say you when you talk about regression youre confident normally but youre not when youre talking about harland are you at all wher up there which great to see im not going to propaganda him anymore because being arrogant about having him in my team but watkins lets talk about watkins where what are we doing here its an enigma isnt it whats dreon wrong is hes got a niggling injury is he being must have mustnt he i think it must be like that salanki injury when he was like carrying something but he was still playing and it wasnt bad enough to restr him but sank game is a bit different to watkins isnt it watkins relies more on the pace id say to get him behind because slank drops deep and slanky can be involved in that whereas watkins needs to hit on the break so its affecting him more he hasnt been pictured in training has he havent we havent seen any training images of him were talking about watkins are we talking about neither have neither have as well as it as it stands time stamp thursday night 11 o climing 11 o00 but watkins again before the last episode you and i were esack to watkins 100 we are not going into everton at home without watkins everton did their best to show us why we shouldnt be going against that because they completely capitulated and philip definitely gonna get chances against them but another 60minute cameo and then not seen or heard of in two weeks they have got champions league to come right so we know thats thats thats l in and so that might managing the load is something that emory will have in mind and presumably watkins is going to be playing champions league games all of them because of the new format theyve got an able deputy in duran right so this is always bring that player on and that player is coming on and scoring goals so its a worry isnt it we definitely cant look at watkins now as an assured asset because we want more we with the injury time were not just losing 60 minutes were losing 35 30 minutes were losing 35 to 40 minutes right and we know that the xg typically in premier league the xg in blocks of time is stronger at the end of a game right thats where the greater amount of xg is generated so losing a player consistently for the last 30 minutes is not someone we want so we cant go there yet i dont think hes ready to play 90 minutes i from what from what ive seen so far i think it would be more of a surprise if he played 90 against everton than it would be he either didnt start or played 60 again and because of that playing those odds i dont think you go there hes too much money with so many other good assets around nine 10m and no penalties which is now going to morgan rogers after his was it for the under 21s ringland took it well great ben great ben that would be handy it might be the only way he gets us any leeding points well he might get him if watkins isnt playing because bloody watkins that keeps messing up his assists its true rogers is great im keeping him for sure anyone else you want to pick out here evan nson good start but only 135 minutes so far chris wood is just l does he keep his does he keep his place whens he gonna get dropped i just dont see big t being fit enough yet i dont think i think were going to go force nine at hfield i dont think chris wood will start that will hurt yell you wont be happy to hear that ive just got a theory were going to play james w prows play anderson behind gibbs white and play sorry have you ever weve done for nine we did a for nine preseason and i think we did it at anfield last season which didnt go well so i woods traveling back because hes been in international duty plus of course i think we need to get james war pr in the team at anfield because with alanga and hudson adoy win three kicks around the box and youve got youve got someone who can score them right so our best route to goal could be winning three kicks around the box right and weve got players in gibbs white langer and hudson andor weve got players who can absolutely do that so i think wood would just slow things down and i dont ive got an inkin he wont start you dont like wood do you i well you cant knock him because theres a p because very good because i think its some like 16 goals isnt it since the since he broke into the team so i think hes scored more open play goals than any other any other forward ridiculous other than irand so his record is incredible but and he just finds a way but its the role he plays in our buildup he does slow our attacks down and hes not i dont know i just think at w anfield the graph that well get from having gibbs white in a force n might be the way we go so lets see lets see what happens theres theres a couple more i think we should just cover aware were reaching the 2our mark rapidly hav done predictions yet but i know theres lots of people talking about welbeck theres lots of people talking about pedro as hes played 45 minutes for brazil and hes got the private jet back and all the stuff going around that but which one of those would you would you go for because im im seeing this there is a lot of talk about them people are worried about pedro so theyre going for welbeck shortterm welbeck but longterm jiao pedro i just i just think herzler likes him hell get the pens i think it i do think that hell end up in the nine brighton better than me but i just think he offers him a bit more than well and well backck hes m you got to manage his minutes so youre probably while youre in people players like rout are getting up to speed wck starting but i think when rout is available well see the change and it wont be j pedro losing his plays i think itll be world back so i think i can see why were going world back now because the trip back and is y pedro going to start i think will i think he will start what do you think i think he might i think he might come on at halim i saw with matoma last season that would be my prediction that he comes on a he comes on at halim but he is the not the fact hes played those 90 minutes in all three games does show the importance that hes valued at in the side which he wasnt getting last year so hopefully starts welbeck is a good option if youre going to be wild carding in six and there is a part of me that wishes i had gone welbeck i went pedro early because he wasnt supposed to be going to brazil he was supposed to be staying at home was a shocker wasnt it having a nice little rest so if i was buying one now and while cing in six i think i probably would go wellbe because i think hes almost certainly gonna start the next two is he gonna be in the team by game week six hell start well beck will start the next two im sure he will i just think the longer it goes on and new players bed in m mat rs out so but hes not a factor youve got two youve got two weeks with welbeck as an almost i say guaranteed start because he could miss out in seven but hes definitely starting this week but pedro is the much better longterm option and if youve tuned into black box this season when as talks about brighton players youve got to listen dear lets talk at our prediction standings before we get into our predictions and were were were almost neck and neck in fact we are sc 27 sc i want to talk about hotline at the top or hottin or whatever you want unbelievable 77 correct outcome thats ridiculous i know its only three weeks but even that a 27 correct score as well this is crazy numbers so i we need to tap into what hes doing because thats crazy i presumably hes a professional gamber and winning a fortune off the boogies every week but that is in i sense there might be a bit of a drop off from hot you mean its gonna fall for the floor noran if he continues that over the season then hed be wishing he played super six rather than just our stupid our stupid game shar in hottin i can if you do want to get involved in this you can join the blackbox patreon there still time fre game in but you if you want to be winning the trophy which is very did you see this youve got the trophy we should put a snip of it in shouldnt we next week well stick it the trophy now exists its no longer a figment of our imagination its been delivered and it was described as very heavy from richard as well as being very nice of course but there is there is a trophy for the winner of the patreon blackbox league and a trophy for the winner of the predictions league as well which is currently been one by time its a heavy trophy but sleeper and manscaper playing for the post so its all fine exactly see we do invest back exactly it all goes back into the channel right predictions now achingly familiar these again arent they so ampton man united youve gone two one united ive gone 31 these are very very boring similar arent they again we dont look at these we just put our scores in and then we only see them when we clip this for the show okay were going away were man united so not too much to talk about there i dont fernandz though come well look at the captains in a minute brighton its which both gone 30 that be dream me being at the amx that would be an amazing result palace leester weve both gone two nil come on mateta get me something the bottom of the forwards list im likely to have e more on that in a minute but yes fham west h both g a draw youve gone to all ive gone one all that might have something to with the fact that smith row could be going for me so on bench this week you fcy goals do you i found this one probably the hardest one to predict i dont know i havent seen a lot of great stuff from fulham so far and west ham were absolutely brilliant against palace and then awful it is man city but poor against them so i just went with the logical draw i feel enough and then filam west ham weve mentioned already liverpool versus forest youve gone 31 ive g 31 31 as well crazy how we go here i think i think we do score i think we do score but then liverpool kill us off this is different rather man city versus brenford ive gone a no bias whatsoever i dont own harland ive gone two nil you do own holland you gone 41 hatrick hat tricks well you see them giving them a hide in do you i think so theyre just on it at the moment and look at brenford when they play liverpool they rolled over i dont i dont see it i think thomas frank sides dont do that theyve had some joy against city in the past as well home and away so i dont know i dont see it being that i think that city win harand gets something but ive gone two nil villa everton were both back in three goals for villa one for everton for you im going 30 though youve gone 31 not have contour and i do its funny i got accused of marks predictions he only predicts the scores because hes got players his team what a surprise that i predict scores according to my fantasy team of course i do i wouldnt have the players if i didnt think theyre g its crazy some of the things we get accused of you up well there is some ages of you havent seen any of those comments youre not gonna youre not going to not own har and then go i think man city gonna win 7even nil of course youre not youre not going to do that anyway villa versus everton weve done bourma versus chelsea close to being the garden center game but because is an eight oclock kickoff i dont think we can find a garden center open at that time but youve gone two one ive gone two all i know you fancied him turn them around i can see it because bournemouth started well hav been very impressed with chelsea could even beat west ham could palace at home and i think other than that like mad 15 minutes against wolves they havent been that great they were all right against man city in the first game but couldnt find a way through i like bournemouth a good team first score weve had first out i know first one terrible home win ive gone a draw next ones this ones different though and this is interesting and again could be the bias because youre youre selling sacka right and im not what a surprise that it affects our predictions youve gotten spurs win and youve told talked about it tonight and you see this as an opportunity for them 21 youre going for its close you might be right they might need three maybe to do it but i just think im gonna im gonna back sam and say sams gonna inspire them to a narrow a narrow victory theyll be delighted would they with a two1 a guitar store at this stage of the season theyll only i reckon theyd wish that it comes at the end of the season and they can snatch them from getting the title but its too early to kill arsenals title hopes off but having said that any defeat is going to hurt when its man city youre chasing i think in hope salanki will be back for this well nothings been seen of him no he was close though they said for the last game against newcastle i just have an inland hes not gonna turn up again right my policy has always been with an injury just sell him because ive been on the end of countless man hes on his way back and hes we think hes back on it and it just goes on for weeks and you just never know how much honesty youre getting so i wouldnt be surprised if hes not back you can get mata like me and get two points every week its a lot more fun ive gone two on arsenal i do think spurs score and im probably gonna hold on because i do think this could go i think arsenal win but it could be 32 there could be a lot of goals here which with the arsal defense you would think no but youre right youre without declan rice without odard what are we going to get so its incredbly difficult game to predict youd hold it and then the final game which ive identified as the as the garden center game its sunday 430 its a prime time for garden center but we both predicted loads of goals strang youve gone youve gone 31 newcastle away win ive gone two all i think it i just dont see the defens is standing up here well ill be back in brunwood watching this with my parents hopefully my moms cooking a nice ro dinner want to play now then dont think he will this would be my nightmare result so ive gone the opposite way to you of predicting what would be good for my team because if newcastle win 31 and ive sold esack that is probably going to be maximum pain and i think isak gets something i need is i know im im not that confident that sacka and esack is outscored by salah and pedro especially if i think pedro could be benched for 45 i think its close and using two free transfers on it as well i dont know tempting the fbl gods and we know what they do when we do that i dont i dont feel great but im im hoping that wolves can find a bit of form at home and newcastle ive looked a bit labored so far but isach started the season in good form for sweden scored the goal against spurs as well im a bit worried you see his comments about fpl managers as well lovely that wasnt it great and ially said he said he was going to score two goals despite me he said i love it when people sell me and then i do well yep again its watching that is horrible isnt it because you can just imagine going god and he warned us and theres just so many things that you can see being played back why that game got to be last in the game i could be having a good game we and it gets to that and then he just goes mad and just ruins me absolutely horrible captains isaac features on this table because its a good fixture of w wolves but were looking at its harem versus sal isnt it theres no question if youve got both where are you going harland you are going harland hes top of the xj on penalty 105 over sell one youre going harland interesting i minut before we look at rob ts data which is always useful we throw it in at this point anyone else you want to pick out here would you be tempted anywh else bruno br after watching southampton defend last game hes hes the one but i wouldnt trust man utd at all pedro if we knew pedro was gonna start he could be a great option but i think were gonna get mean how many times this season and we need to bring up the matrix here are we going to be discussing any other player avn c and harland i know its three weeks and theyve top scored and theyve delivered so that will change but you do start to wonder whether the bracket underneath when were looking at the sacka son bruno de bruyne foden thats the bracket underneath are they going to be able to make a step up because at the moment they havent yet and its about what you talked about sacker earlier the ceiling versus salah and harlands not the same is it i do hope they do push up but i just its not happening yet is it were gonna have those two weeks of southampton and leicester where sacka is going to be very popular but other than that i think its going to be holland and sah but if youre paying 15m for holland you need to captain him every week with the odd exception of a tough game when someones got a good one because like five and six okay but youre gonna if youve got harand youre going to captain him between seven and 10 i imagine there it is in the matrix you look at that run seven and 10 its full of at home walls away so home bournemouth away i worry about not having him during that per i can cover it with sacka for game week seven game week eight though where do i go where will i will i still have son i dont think so i you go sal dont you home to chelsea but you do salah in a home fixture of course but then salah goes to arsenal when harlands at home to santon so ive got to where do i go there im not gonna have watkins or palmer am i so me saying i dont know when im gonna wild card i think i think im going to be faced with having to unless ive got some city cover then am i going to captain fen over harland maybe but nines a savage week nine is a savage week for if youre going non harland that is because thats theres gonna be triple captains out on harland again that week and you cant go salah at arsenal and sacka own to liverpool can you i dont know could be a game of goals and you probably have to dont you have to back goals and hope that salah will return watkins doesnt deserve to be on this list does he at the moment but by then he could he could be more of a factor for us but youre definitely not captaining watkins at the moment even with everton at home and we were talking about it again last episode saying watkins could be a captain opportun for us this week no chance lets look at robs data rob t robt fbl he puts out excellent graphics like this based on spreadex betting odds and no question citys 295 projected goals 46 percent chance clean sheet versus liverpool 28 projected goals those two right out in front with brighton 240 so those three teams are the ones expected to get the goals this week no surprise and like you said he does favor it does favor harland over salah here not only because the amount of goals projected but also the monopoly that harland has on city goals versus salah so yes i think if you got both you go harland if you havent got harland youve got a good bet in seller this game week but thats going to change as we get later in the season from game week seven onwards weve got a problem so weve got to address that and see what we do capy though i think is pretty cut and dry lets look at our teams in to round up on this is yours as talk us for it for the podcast this is mine so henderson in goal with home game against leicester im hopeful with some he can build his four points from last week its trent porro and robinson in defense im happy with that porro has got arsenal but im backing them to win so then theres no way theyre going to get a clean sheet but he is still taking up ridiculous positions its sacka jotta gordon and rogers which was a disappointing midfield last week sacka is gonna go tonight i think for salah sacas very close no sacks close to a price drop it doesnt affect me because hes already gone up one so i dont need to make a move tonight but it is probably gonna be sacka to ss getting a price drop is he hes gone up to 106 now hes now hes dropping i think so many people are making that move to and then har and captain mata whos been disappointing since i bought him in now has entia and pedro who came in very early in the international break and smith were on the bench so if pedro does miss out completely or if har misses out completely because there is some talk about one of his friends has sadly passed away hes been theyve said that he might be given compassionate leave for it which would rock the boat but hes been training today i dont think thats going to happen but want to monitor make sure your bench is at least lined up correctly just in case i saw that in the chat and i thought well i better not highlight that comment because ive not heard that and that is like thats furious speculation that we dont want to throw in at this stage but right he has he has trained today though so i think its unlikely i think he missed he missed a bit of time to go and not deal with it deal with it himself but hes he seems back but maybe hell be given a bit of time its unlikely fair enough what do you expect then green arrow im a bit worried about quite a few players josa gordon rogers mateta havent delivered for me yet this season pedro might be benched poo concedes henderson coned somehow much disaster is what youre but mata has got lester at home so its not bad pedro has got ip switch rogers has got everton so it could go completely the other way and i will have sal and harland so im gonna predict about to finish the week about where i am 800 kish youll take that right that be right this is me rya lewis trent coner smith rose son salah captain sacka rogers isak and xal pedro i am going to make a transfer and that transfer will be smith row to e i have the money to do that thats nice and then the idea will be that i will probably roll next week and then go take true transfers into game week six and go sonto and bumo isach to havs is what im potentially looking at although looking at the captaincy coming up there might be grounds for keeping son because he could give me a route for the captaincy if i dont go harland so i dont know i want in bumo for that run but i do have there so i have some cover of brenford for six this week how will i do like every week it will depend what harland does so my fate is in his hands because i think salah could eas i think salah will return i think forest will lose i think theyll score two or three goals as ive said in my predictions i think ill get something from sacka i probably will get a clean sheet out of lewis probably i could get a clean sheet from trent but i do think we score coner could keep a clean she as well i think its going to be an okay week but if you dont have holland its down to that if he blanks youre going to get a green arrow if he scores youre going to get a gray or red its its the way its going at the moment if you can get both here thats the way to go it depends on what my supporting cast does if son e sacka isak in particular me isak could be a key player for me because if hes getting heavily sold then if he returns then he could be a difference maker so its interesting these are scenarios that im glad weve got theres theres such variety in the way teams are going and players who could have had that game week its a its a wider pool isnt it than normal and but those fringe players are so key because if you if you dont have a palmer and he goes off or you dont have a sack or you dont have a har and you cant have them all you need your fringe players your rogers your matas your smith rose whoever to chip in with some points to try and make up that deficit a bit and if youre on the wrong side of the premiums and your supporting cast arent chipping in points you could you could have an absolute people can catch up 30 40 points on you quickly this year theres going to be a lot of big swings for people this year and its youre not going to get it right every week but you just need to hope that youve got players in who can who can make up the difference im trying not to look at other peoples teams and say im im going to logically get do the right move which i think is smith ro tza i like that and then ive got to hope that one of son isak or saaka come in for me because if all three of them blank and harland scores im getting red so ive got to get something from sonak and sacka i think one of theyre a good for theyre good players so i think one of those three will return and theyre all going to be pretty significant differentials the way the market has gone because isak and sacka are leaving teams and son isnt in many teams so i think ill be okay but its its the way its every week im like that and i dont mind that i dont mind that i want to rely on a broader range of players rather than just the heavy hitters which was a lot of last season it was like well if palmer and salah and harand come in youre going to do well and they were doing well every week so its better it feels better and im im so hyped about this season the way its going so far im im not concerned how well im doing im more concerned at the moment about the state of fbl and the way it is and its getting me excited again about playing it which is a good thing which just four players the same this week team and at spells last year for the first time ever we had 11 players the same and it felt horrible didnt it you were like 150 points ahead of me wasnt ideal and were were more or less neck and neck so its i like it i like where we are i like where the seasons at i like the decisions were having to make i like the dilemmas and the fact that people are selling eak and sacka and going i dont feel happy about it thats great thats what the d thats the dilemmas we want playing this game right we dont want decisions to be easy we want to be punished at times and make us think twice thats what playing this game should be about so well see well see im looking forward to the weekend thats where we go apart from youve got two wild card teams to have a look at do you want to show them now we got over the two hours and might sck them up whats behind these then this is wild card one this is the harland only team i just thought i thought theres a lot of people on wild cards this week so i thought we could at least touch on something so i just had to go putting together like i said i wrote the article just with a couple different ideas one i totally ignored well until well only when you found out it was m me thats thats fine but this is using plan fpl this was a while closing up because thats thats with ver bragen and flecken in goal with trent lewis and gayy sber and greaves on the bench so youve got s that comes in for the great fiction gay week six its son in to target these two and then youd look to switch him over to sacka i prefer son for the next two weeks given i think spurs are gonna win this game and then sak and then e diaz and m and then haren captain i think i would still go for watkins if i was on a wild card this week although thats looking each day that passes and hes hes gonna start everton isnt he unless he is injured i think i would go for him but you could also move to isack and just take the guaranteed start against wolves i dont mind that either and then pedro and then fleen rogers sleep and greaves on the bench i think this is a pretty strong team to world card into theres no real weakness there i dont think and youve got the double up on bright the triple up on brighton for the next two as well the ar defender on the bench as well skews the strength of it a little bit and what youve got then i youve done this to show the difference between the teams with salo and harand so this is the salo and harand team and i dont hate this so this is ray in goal with trent lewis and gayi so same back three but ray is in instead of the the rotation because its a bit cheaper to do that because you havent got to pay six million for cba saka e salah m and rogers and then harland and jel pedro up top and then the bench youve got to play you got have two four billion defenders to have this so stevens and greaves are both starting ive managed to get dap in there as like another option as a five5 you could put him down to a four five and strengthen the defense somewhere else give yourself a bit of a bench i dont hate this its got ry its got trent its got sacka its got salah and harland the issue is the issue is that youve got m rogers and pedro all under six million that you have to play every week and you cant move away from them i look at this and go where are my transfers going to be a week unless im moving e out im not going to be touching trent or lewis if lewis stays on the team im okay i could move four five defender out in and out but thats thats a lot of fun isnt it so my input into this team for a good period unless theres injuries will be which five am i gonna move out this week it is do i bring in do i bring in i dont know if i want that game this might well be the an optimal lineup is that a lineup i want to take on and manage i know okay is it about rank is it about the fun and engagement for me theres still an element of fun and engagement and i like the decisions were making and we talk about it just now with the sacka and eak decisions these are tough decisions there are if they go wrong its big swings those are the things i like i dont like going all should i go min us a meno thats thats like doing weeks of that is gna kill my enjoyment if i get loads of points but i think it will i think you would look at around seven or eight to think about taking salah out and redistributing your funds a little bit more also the other problem with this is lewis as well at 47 if he suddenly does get dropped youre then looking at stevens and greaves coming in like a law firm doesnt it take stevens and greaves so you could you could do lewis to dunk or to or to for defender to give you that certainty or maybe you do stevens to vanderberg it is a bombsite bench absolutely but i love that theres theres not like i said unless you move the lap down to a four five and then you get in two four five defenders theres not theres not a lot of movement here in the chat triggers in the chat thats not trigger lips is it talk fba that i think it could be i think it could so we welcome were getting going very well at the moment well i take it from the badge thats him as well isnt it with the the aussie reference i know maybe its not could be and one comment i did want to i starred earlier that i thought was fantastic from greg fost just in case youre settled on that sacka transfer look at that sacka scored 28 points against spurs last season the most against any opponent there we go lets lets throw that one in there just to make you feel a little bit worried a bit more about selling fake news fake news fake well done greg love that propaganda keep that coming right should we should we hit some of the should we hit some of the super chats because we might keep going into the night we might be able to hit midnight if we keep going im so tired im just delirious so we might as well should i should i r through these stick a few on this is from flanny boy 1888 i am wild carding without harland team rated at 95 in fpl planner with be in it and point three in the blank question is should i go for a cheaper city mid and if so i can get to harland in week seven still bra not going with him now but wanting to think about how to bring him in a bit later if you didnt wild card harand now would you get him in seven or would you just try and ride it out by way thank you for the very generous super chat for i just dont see the logic in not wild carding him in now is it because you feel the team will be stronger without him for this period maybe you could create a team stronger without him for this period id like to see what it is you mean its 95 in ai and who am i to question the ai im convinced the ai is just slippers answering instant messages by the way every time takes a screenshot or sends it enough one to go send that hes building it hes hes hes the brains behind it absolutely boring theres no computer at work its just its just andy in the slippers h got i i think we looked at the capy matrix right and we looked at that run and well bring it up again now if you havent got harlem from seven to 10 where are you going with the captaincy yes youve got sacker and seven fine game week eight youve got a problem game week nine youve got a big problem so i think thats what i would fear i think youve gna if youre not going to wild card harland in now yes youve got to get him in may certainly by eight so if i go for a cheaper city mid it has to be kdb at the moment because fodens not there some genius about greish earlier maybe thats it there isnt a cheaper city mid is there rogery is like six million or 65 but you are delirious you need not well my point is youre not going to go there so youre getting de bruyne to cover harand essentially i think you just ride that if you if you think theres not going to be much in it between them which i dont agree with but if youre going without him now i think you just accept that youre probably not g have him so the same logic applies if you think that harlands not necessary now why do you need him seven thats exactly i would argue you go harand now and then you wait for foden and see what happens and then if you need to move off harland to spread funds youve got a foden to go to i would rather go to a foden than the kdb myself i would not be war carding about holland now no nor would i no so thats thats hopefully weve earn at 10 pounds i feel like we have get in touch and well pay it back to youny do dont do any of the things that youre youre suggesting copy said david james says i bloody love these pods up the borrow mid the midd fan i dont mind midd they getting on this season w first i havent looked i its criminal because i dont look at the championship now long gone its long on but i i dont mind bar and is carrick still there i think he is isnt should season last b are seventh okay thats all right the championship is so groeling i dont never want to go back there its such a hard league all dont miss it at all this is from jordan nayed hi guys bench one of gabrielle porro or lewis cant bench lewis no its its porro i would pces porro from open play i would bench porro i bench gabrielle we say it because were in pain because its a very difficult decision there not much in it is there i think theres only one team keeping the clean sheet if theres going to be a clean sheet and thats thats arsenal and so youre down to how likely is porro to get an attack in return and hes up against a good defense so cor gab i but then gabrielles on corners in a different ill go gabrielle myself over but difference of opinion thats fair enough this is from ay thank you for super chat do you start smith row at home to west ham or rogers at home to everton rogers im benching smith row currently for rogers so were on that front i smith row is not getting the full 90 yet is he still not so its just expected minutes and thats a factor plus rogers could be on pens i we joke about it but he could well be so and i think everton have conceded three goals in every game so far so everton is if youre 5050 everton is the team to target at the moment at the moment at the moment and then finally from davys family first have trent robinson johnson and barco god sorry get the blame for that theres going to be teams of barco in right to gw 38 gut punch you every week hes hes got a drop so would you do hall to pal torres or wood to pedro or rea to martinez and hall to lewis trying to remain in the clouds of overall rank 13 well done david family first well done sounds all right dont hate that r wood to pedro is interesting given my theory about would not start in but ive got the certainly wouldnt get rid of ryer halter lewis i would do halter lewis you cant you cant do halter lewis yes you can no save some money i see i wouldnt do that then right so its the first one hal to pal to pal i think thats just a youre not going to regret that are you although would to would to pedro thats a good longterm move it depends when youre when youre wild carding if youre wild carding in six i think wood to welbeck wood to welbeck you put well back in there if youre wning in six im gonna say hall toal just so i can say toow used to be one of my favorite bands thats what you get you thats what you pay for with these super chats great advice im basing it solely on the

22,fplblackbox,l0oClUyq9nk,FPL Wildcard? | GW4,2024-09-08T21:18:52Z,[Music] [Music] right game week three it's uh Sunday morning I'm at the end of the road Festival bit of a strange game week for me to try and kind of keep an eye on things while that music festival I've got to say um I've had about 3 hours sleep because we're camping next to what appears to be an Olympic snorer who turns in at 10: p.m. every every night um so I'm a bit delirious and um yeah I'm starting to wonder whether the sheen of music festivals is wearing off a bit I've got heartburn from the food tinitus from the music um and for I think I paid 14 quid for a duck rrap yesterday and I've been pooing in a bin for 3 Days um yeah I should qualify that the bit the toilets here are kind of like cubicles with bins below them I haven't literally been looking around for bins to put in although to be fair after the uh second hattick from Highland I did PR feel pretty feral that was a blow I've got to say I've tried not to let it affect my mood whilst being here um managed to see some of it on Match of the day last night um oh yeah I'll keep my hand in even while here and uh yeah prob excruciating but I've got I've got son and Salah today and you know one or two returns from them and everything will be all right and yeah I'm not thinking of getting him oh no no no no you know it's only regression from here surely so um maybe that's the uh lack of sleep and uh the lack of medication speaking but no not for me so yeah I'm going to be um returning home tomorrow and I'll catch up on the game then start doing the video look at some stats watch some of the matches back then so I'll I'll see you then I'm going to um go and look for another big see you a bit later so I'm back in the Civilized world back home um but that was almost a week ago in fact was a week ago and I haven't been able to film anything since because of uh the weather's been so bloody awful in fact it's pretty bad today it's damp very muddy underfoot could slip over at any moment but I thought I'd do a a quick video a bit different really because the game week review has kind of been and gone now so I thought I'd um get on camera and talk about PS my team and some of the common issues that people have got in their FBO lineups going into game week four over the international break so yeah I'm I'm still smarting from the Harland hatrick the second one of course but of course on that day Salah matched him with another 17p pointer and he's matched in 41 points to this to this stage after three game week it's quite extraordinary how the players have kind of just fitted into their brackets and scored points called only Sal and harand top tier 41 points and you've got sacka Palmer sa all kind of doing their job in their price bracket um it's probably the likes of Diaz who's kind of broken out and exceeded expectations in terms of his value more than him in a bit I'm sure so what I do about Honda am I panicking not yet the way I look at it is you know he's obviously got back toback hat tricks but sellers kept paay so that's been good my problem hasn't been not only in Harlem my problem has been the captain SE because game week one our captain Dak got Salah 10 points game week two then Captain sacka last game week and of course that's been a bit unfortunate most of the managers around me have either gone Harland or Salah the reason why it's unfortunate is because isak and sacker of opening in teams that have been reduced to 10 men with almost well more than 45 minutes to go in some cases so I've got to look at it philosophically and think that if they' have kept 11 men on the pitch both Newcastle and Arsenal could have scored more goals isak and sacka would have done better and therefore the gap between myself my team and teams with Harland captain in all three games would have been smaller so I don't think there's too much wrong on my lineup and Harland has of course been you know he's not going to keep this this hatrick a game up is he so I've got to think there's got to be some aggression we're entering a phase now where I think Salah and sacka that combo which I've got could do better than harand given the fixtur so right now yeah no Panic with Holland from [Music] me yeah so the plan will be to Captain Salo and sacka up until game week eight um I think harlander has fullham at home in game week seven which is a great fixture obviously but but sakur s Anon at home so I feel okay with that but then from game week 8 City's fixtures really look very strong and I don't know if I want to go forward without Harland at that point so that between seven and eight is where I'm looking to play the wild card and that of course is another International break so that kind of plays into the hands there so if you're not playing it between this period game week three and four game between game week 7 8 looks the next next best period because you go into a City Spring of fixtures now don't get me wrong I have looked to see if I can play it over this break obviously we're we're weak in now so I probably left it too late anyway but when I looked at it it the lineup I could get with Harland and Salah and sacka cuz I do think that's necessary more on that I'll try and cover that in a bit but I do think holding sacker is necessary that kind of wild card would give me a 4 five keeper it' give me two four five Defenders and a four million Defender and cruet it give me a 4 five attacker as my third attacker so for me I would be I'd have a very weak bench I'll be over dependent on Rogers in Midfield and I'd have to be playing a 4 five Defender and have a four million Defender as backup some weeks it's it's just too skinny for me I just don't like it so I'm going to I'm going to resist that with a view that I've got to obviously keep an eye on budget I've got to manage that very carefully but that's what I do anyway and then look to look to potentially play that wild card between game week seven and eight I will roll transfers so the way I'm thinking is it's going to one transfer this week I'll probably get e in this week then I'll hold for gameweek five make two transfers in gameweek six cuz I want to get on the brenford and Arsenal swing so I'm looking at mumo and Havoc at that point then I'll roll on game we seven and then take two into game week eight now I'll have a decision to make at that point whether I have to play the Wild Card going into game week eight in order to get on City or whether two transfers will be enough I could take a hit will I want Harland at that point or will folen be a factor fod Mar I don't know I mean there's something going on there but hopefully by going we gate foden might be in our thinking and could won't cover Harland but it give us some City cover for that good run that's the plan at the moment um but we'll see I'm certainly going to get through this break without the wild card [Music] anyway but should you wild card well it's I guess if you're leaking team value that that is going to be really annoying if you're sitting on Quan you're sitting on and kungu in particular then then perhaps it is time to make the move particularly if you don't have Trent if you don't have Robertson and you don't have a means to cover that Liverpool attack presumably a lot of you have gone Harland or Salah um obviously if you don't if you have Harland and you're trying to get to Liverpool tack you could get to Trent you could get to Robertson you could go Diaz although the intern National break could be a a worry there but obviously a lot of people are looking at selling sacka and getting to sell that way now there is Merit in that for a couple of game weeks because obviously Saka has Spurs and then he has Man City so I get it I get why people are looking at that but from game week six you're going to want to get on Arsenal there's a big Arsenal swing at that point along with a prolonged swing towards brenford to so if you're wild carding and you're losing sacka for Salah or you're forgoing any brenford assets which I imagine you will have to if you're going to try and get Harland and Salah then you've got to have a plan I think for game week six you've got to you got to be able to navigate back to some Arsenal cover and maybe get yourself a brenford asset as well because if you don't you'll be up against managers with perhaps sacka with havit as a double up ryer in goal or an ARA Defender and perhaps against managers who got in Boomer and witer that's what I plan to do that's what I'm going to move towards for game week six so if you're wild carding in this period for game week 4 and you're going Harland and Sal I get it but just think about that swing from game week six [Music] on so just round off this video a few questions that perhaps you're going to be asking yourself over this uh very International break period um first of all should you worry about players coming back from Long Haul flights etc mean obviously You' got a worry about injury that might happen whilst out International duty but traveling back is also a factor and we've seen J Pedro be a late call up to the Brazil squad weren't expecting that so that's obviously concerned because he's well owned and goes into a plummet switch fixure that we wanton him for I'll be starting him um and you know Diaz is similar very popular player playing with Columbia so he has a lot Long Haul flight I think with both those players and others traveling back what we should do is basically monitor what news we get from the clubs cuz journalists will ask about it clubs will make special you know process to try and get their players back on time to play for Saturday so I don't think it's too much for concern we do tend to overplay this kind of stuff so I wouldn't be worried yet but I certainly wouldn't move towards those players I would certainly wait and see and try and get as much information as you can [Music] what about Watkins um he's a player that I add on my long-term watch list and around about this time I was going to bring him in but obviously what we've seen so far over the three game weeks there's been lots of Mis chances but early substitutions in all three games and you know the former Jan is a concern cuz Emory knows he's got a very effective option on the bench to to take him off and rest him and and obviously there could be it seems some kind of issue here with Watkins whether it's fatigue from the Euros it's not clear um but I think we need more time before we can make a decision to bring Watkins in even though Villa's fixures are so appealing so I'm not going to move towards him if You' got him you hold him no question I think he starts whether he gets more than an hour remains to be seen so not a move to Watkins not a player I'd bring on the wild card not a player i' bring him with a transfer but certainly a whole what about Palmer another mystery around him because he hasn't been included in Chelsea's Europa conference League Squad of course which was a strange one presumably that you know it's just managing the load is is the factor behind that not on International Duty as well which I thought was a bit stranger because Lee carsley knows Palmer well he's a player that he'd want to establish in his team and Palmer obviously would want to stay St a claim for a starting roll on the carsle so that that worries me a bit more I mean both of those things for me are making me think that yeah I can afford to look elsewhere right now and that Palmer although he's incredibly attractive as an fbl asset with decent fixtures to come the urgency to move towards him isn't quite enough yet I'm sitting on son and for me I think I need to go son to e rather than son up to Palmer because e has that less fixure he has United at home and then he goes to Everton and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to keep one eye on Pala don't get me wrong but I just think there's a lot of noise around him that is W me a little bit and I need more time as I've said time and time again I need more time to assess what this moresa Chelsea is going to play like and what will come Palmer's way in terms of [Music] points so that's it for me a shorten video this week not the usual ual material so sorry about that but I had to have that time off between the festival and and now so I couldn't really look back on the game it didn't seem relevant so I thought I'd hit you a few topics there just to tide us over on this incredibly dull International break I do hate them it's absolutely awful um just a week to go before we kick off on FPL again and I can't wait for that um so we've got black box next week um so just a time stamp this this is Sunday Sunday afternoon so in a few days time we'll be prepping for the next episode of blackbox we'll be looking forward to game week four we'll have obviously we'll go into depth from some of the things I spoke about in this video but that's it for me now um I'll see you soon see you on blackbox in the week don't forget to subscribe to the channel and hit the like if you enjoy this video see you next [Music] [Music] time oh jesz,2607,right game week three its sunday morning im at the end of the road festival bit of a strange game week for me to try and keep an eye on things while that music festival ive got to say ive had about 3 hours sleep because were camping next to what appears to be an olympic snorer who turns in at 10 pm every night so im a bit delirious and im starting to wonder whether the sheen of music festivals is wearing off a bit ive got heartburn from the food tinitus from the music and for i think i paid 14 quid for a duck rrap yesterday and ive been pooing in a bin for 3 days i should qualify that the bit the toilets here are like cubicles with bins below them i havent been looking around for bins to put in although to be fair after the second hattick from highland i did pr feel pretty feral that was a blow ive got to say ive tried not to let it affect my mood whilst being here managed to see some of it on match of the day last night ill keep my hand in even while here and prob excruciating but ive got ive got son and salah today and one or two returns from them and everything will be all right and im not thinking of getting him no its only regression from here surely so maybe thats the lack of sleep and the lack of medication speaking but no not for me so im going to be returning home tomorrow and ill catch up on the game then start doing the video look at some stats watch some of the matches back then so ill ill see you then im going to go and look for another big see you a bit later so im back in the civilized world back home but that was almost a week ago in fact was a week ago and i havent been able to film anything since because of the weathers been so bloody awful in fact its pretty bad today its damp very muddy underfoot could slip over at any moment but i thought id do a quick video a bit different because the game week review has been and gone now so i thought id get on camera and talk about ps my team and some of the common issues that people have got in their fbo lineups going into game week four over the international break so im im still smarting from the harland hatrick the second one of course but of course on that day salah matched him with another 17p pointer and hes matched in 41 points to this to this stage after three game week its quite extraordinary how the players have just fitted into their brackets and scored points called only sal and harand top tier 41 points and youve got sacka palmer sa all doing their job in their price bracket its probably the likes of diaz whos broken out and exceeded expectations in terms of his value more than him in a bit im sure so what i do about honda am i panicking not yet the way i look at it is hes got back toback hat tricks but sellers kept paay so thats been good my problem hasnt been not only in harlem my problem has been the captain se because game week one our captain dak got salah 10 points game week two then captain sacka last game week and of course thats been a bit unfortunate most of the managers around me have either gone harland or salah the reason why its unfortunate is because isak and sacker of opening in teams that have been reduced to 10 men with almost well more than 45 minutes to go in some cases so ive got to look at it philosophically and think that if they have kept 11 men on the pitch both newcastle and arsenal could have scored more goals isak and sacka would have done better and therefore the gap between myself my team and teams with harland captain in all three games would have been smaller so i dont think theres too much wrong on my lineup and harland has of course been hes not going to keep this hatrick a game up is he so ive got to think theres got to be some aggression were entering a phase now where i think salah and sacka that combo which ive got could do better than harand given the fixtur so right now no panic with holland from me so the plan will be to captain salo and sacka up until game week eight i think harlander has fullham at home in game week seven which is a great fixture but sakur s anon at home so i feel okay with that but then from game week 8 citys fixtures look very strong and i dont know if i want to go forward without harland at that point so that between seven and eight is where im looking to play the wild card and that of course is another international break so that plays into the hands there so if youre not playing it between this period game week three and four game between game week 7 8 looks the next best period because you go into a city spring of fixtures now dont get me wrong i have looked to see if i can play it over this break were were weak in now so i probably left it too late anyway but when i looked at it the lineup i could get with harland and salah and sacka cuz i do think thats necessary more on that ill try and cover that in a bit but i do think holding sacker is necessary that wild card would give me a 4 five keeper it give me two four five defenders and a four million defender and cruet it give me a 4 five attacker as my third attacker so for me i would be id have a very weak bench ill be over dependent on rogers in midfield and id have to be playing a 4 five defender and have a four million defender as backup some weeks its its just too skinny for me i just dont like it so im going to im going to resist that with a view that ive got to keep an eye on budget ive got to manage that very carefully but thats what i do anyway and then look to look to potentially play that wild card between game week seven and eight i will roll transfers so the way im thinking is its going to one transfer this week ill probably get e in this week then ill hold for gw five make two transfers in gw six cuz i want to get on the brenford and arsenal swing so im looking at mumo and havoc at that point then ill roll on game we seven and then take two into game week eight now ill have a decision to make at that point whether i have to play the wild card going into game week eight in order to get on city or whether two transfers will be enough i could take a hit will i want harland at that point or will folen be a factor fod mar i dont know theres something going on there but hopefully by going we gate foden might be in our thinking and could wont cover harland but it give us some city cover for that good run thats the plan at the moment but well see im certainly going to get through this break without the wild card anyway but should you wild card well its if youre leaking team value that is going to be annoying if youre sitting on quan youre sitting on and kungu in particular then perhaps it is time to make the move particularly if you dont have trent if you dont have robertson and you dont have a means to cover that liverpool attack presumably a lot of you have gone harland or salah if you dont if you have harland and youre trying to get to liverpool tack you could get to trent you could get to robertson you could go diaz although the intern national break could be a worry there but a lot of people are looking at selling sacka and getting to sell that way now there is merit in that for a couple of game weeks because saka has spurs and then he has man city so i get it i get why people are looking at that but from game week six youre going to want to get on arsenal theres a big arsenal

24,FPLFocal,RWNXvIig1qY,FINAL FPL THOUGHTS GW4 | HAALAND NEWS ⚠️,2024-09-13T12:23:02Z,"welcome back for another video final video before the deadline in this one we're going to discuss all the biggest questions and dilemmas that you're facing for gami 4 and my final thoughts this week and we of course have got lots of press conferences today so we're going to dig into some key news that you might have missed let's start with the je Hawks who ask should we avoid Shia Pedro this gameing because of his International duties so what's hler had to say about this then well he said quote I think we have a great Medical Department who will do everything for the Regeneration of the players also the players themselves they're professional enough to know what they have to do to be fully recovered for Saturday and he also said of course they can't train today with the team but they will be back on the training ground and then it's about giving them a good recovery and hopefully they can train tomorrow and then of course they'll be part of the squad so my take on this quote is it's overall positive essentially saying that the players know what they need to do to be fully recovered to play this weekend the other good news is sh Pedra played a total of 45 minutes over the break which is nothing over a 2E period however there was a lot of traveling and he got back late coming back from South America he might only get one session before the game in my view he's still a perfectly fine player to buy however if you're going to Wild Card in gamei six in a couple of weeks you could go for well backck instead for the same prize who of course wasn't involved internationally over the break J Pedro is generally the favored pick as he's played more minutes and he on penalties but for two weeks well back's a good punt as well I've pought Jia Pedro myself while we're on the subject to Bryson Alex asks is now a good time to buy Bryson Defender based on recent form and upcoming fixtures and who should be buy well it's definitely a good week to buy given they've got two decent home fixtures ahead and for me it's D call for bugam Van hex should be nailed as well but dun is undoubtedly nailed Herer implied that ver bran is his number one keeper now and he's not going to be rotating like we saw last season and occas missed it the only reason that he missed the first couple of game weeks was due to injury over the summer as Stan and cadog are two on the watch list for me for later in the season they could both become great picks if they get regular minutes it seems like a matter of time until 4 and a half mil KOC gets his first start Roger asks whether the Arsenal plans changed to ver God's injury so my personal plan at the moment is to keep sacka and then add havocs to my team in gameing six even without erard Arsenal should be able to beat Leicester and Southampton pretty comfortably in gameing six and seven on Fantasy Football Scout one of the many members features you get is team news and predicted lineups for all teams link below to join with a 40% discount so here's the Arsenal predicted lineup which I do agree with hav has got a good chance of playing slightly deeper in Midfield and the ear God role which reduces his appeal a little bit this doesn't put me off buy G 6 currently though and N God should be back around gami 7 if you're waiting up buying Salah for sacka then ard's injury might make that decision a bit easier but could obviously backfire given saca's record against Spurs if you have made that move already then you might take comfort in the Ard injury in a way if you haven't watched the experts video that'll be on screen at the end we did a deeper dive into Arsenal's record with and without erard and the team Callum says rate the app out of 10 well I'll give it a solid 10 in my unbiased opinion if you've not got it yet then you can join about 70,000 people that use the website now which is crazy it's out on by Android and iOS links down below to get it it's completely free with tons of useful FPL tools and we've got some class features that we're working on so it's only going to get better as well latic asks Diaz or J for his Liverpool triple up he's already got train and seller in his case this one's actually really tricky to answer this week both for on International Duty Diaz played 180 minutes and he did score against Peru and they did Argentina as well which is about as tough as fix has come but they did actually beat them 21 josa played over the break as well including the full 19 their final match which was on Sunday Diaz played two days later and he did have more traveling so I'd just about give it to jot if I was picking one the last thing to mention is that Darwin's suspended from International Duty so he didn't play at all over the break which makes it even closer as he's the main competition for J honestly flip a COR in this one but I'd go for J this charger 7 asks whether I think we'll be able to hold on for The elusive 5 free transfers and if so would you immediately use them from any wild card or would you use the wild card and keep them now in case you missed it this season onwards the wild card and the free hit no longer wipe your free transfers which does affect strategy now now I would aim to have three or four maximum before wild carding cuz with a wild card the goal is generally not to immediately have booked in transfers so if you have a wild card that's well thought out there's every chance that you could roll twice and then you're up to five anyway I think very few are going to be able to roll up to five this season that said the top ranked team yet to make a transfer is fifth in the world but that's an anomaly definitely not going to be typical so I like the wild card with the extra Ro transfers rather than spending them in Wild Card later they're both pretty close though really the other thing worth mentioning is this new rule sort of kills the one big punts and FPL before wild carding now previously if you had two three transfers and you're about to wild card then you basically always take a one big punt on someone and then you take them back out if you need so that's another strategy change it's less worth it now cuz you can carry those transfers over after the Wild Card hopefully I explained that well I'm not sure if I did question from Daniel who asks is a downgrade from vardal to Lewis a priority move given Lewis's Advanced role so far this season I'd argue it's the opposite of a priority move although he has look fantastic he's much cheaper and he has to started three games he's got competition for that role and pep can quite easily change the system as well on a game by game basis where it's Walker or kja that could play there now AK was stretched off over the break as well and he could be out for a while so gavardo has got less competition now and in my view much better for expected minute so I wouldn't make this move alen lump asks if having free Midfield is under 6 mil is sustainable is the only way to own Harland Salah Palmer and Tren well for this to work you really need those sub six million midfielders to deliver or you need all your premiums to deliver and they simply W every week I managed to fit in harand Sal palman Robertson on the Wild Card video which is 1 mil less than having TR but even then that was with a view to selling Salah to sackur and gamix six to free up a further 2 and a half mil or so it can definitely work but I think it's too much money chucked into four players I mean that's 45 A2 million of four players at the 100 Mil budget from gami 6 anywhere a combination like having inom and havit should outscore Palmer off Salah and a super cheap forward a quick Round Up of some other news then from the press conferences Callum Wilson's behind where they wanted him to be so isak's minutes under absolutely no threat for the time being if he kept him not even an early substitution looking likely though were no very popular mood this week was Isaak to Jia Pedro or wellber to help fun Salah it was reported yesterday that harand trained with the squad but he will be allowed to take compassionate leave after the death of a close family friend so there's been a bit of concern that the most own player in the game could be a doubt for G for now Holland's response on social media suggests that he's got no plans to take leave the same actually happened last season with a family member passing pep was asked about it in the press conference and he said quote it was a tough moment for him and his family and it was sad news are thoughts of with him and his family and we'll see tomorrow if he's mentally and physically able to play my personal feeling is he will play and obviously there's no risk in captain in him he'll either start or probably won't play at all so just be careful with Vice captaincy as always jav ellit fractured his foot during the break and he's going to be out for the foreseeable future now the main player this probably have an impact in is obis who looks a bit better for minutes k has trained three or four times for Li ball now he's probably the one that's likely to come on for Sal than Elliot would have been some man city news from Pep who conf confir that both rodri and foden are back in training and available for selection foden's only 6.3% owned it could be a crazy differential from gami 7 when they've got a run of furland wolves Southampton Bournemouth and Brighton pep also stressed in the press conference that the first three gamei of preseason V and preseason is over in the sense that they've no longer got midweek off and they're going to have plenty of midweek games less time to recover and train and he alluded to rotation as well also saying that players won't be playing every match so what's the latest on sanki by the way how is he still not dropped in priz anyway POA cogle said salanki improved as well and he trained the back half of this week we still have two days to go with those guys so hopefully they get through the training okay and they are available he also said that vanen trained all the way through the international break and he's ready to play in the Northland and Derby thanks for watching and hit subscribe if this was helpful for weekly FB content like this to help guide you through the season we'll be live right here for a deadline stream tomorrow see you all then",1990,welcome back for another video final video before the deadline in this one were

advanced role so far this season id argue its the opposite of a priority move although he has look fantastic hes much cheaper and he has to started three games hes got competition for that role and pep can quite easily change the system as well on a game by game basis where its walker or kja that could play there now ak was stretched off over the break as well and he could be out for a while so gavardo has got less competition now and in my view much better for expected minute so i wouldnt make this move alen lump asks if having free midfield is under 6 mil is sustainable is the only way to own harland salah palmer and tren well for this to work you need those sub six million midfielders to deliver or you need all your premiums to deliver and they simply w every week i managed to fit in harand sal palman robertson on the wild card video which is 1 mil less than having tr but even then that was with a view to selling salah to sackur and gamix six to free up a further 2 and a half mil or so it can definitely work but i think its too much money chucked into four players thats 45 a2 million of four players at the 100 mil budget from gami 6 anywhere a combination like having inom and havit should outscore palmer off salah and a super cheap forward a quick round up of some other news then from the press conferences callum wilsons behind where they wanted him to be so isaks minutes under absolutely no threat for the time being if he kept him not even an early substitution looking likely though were no very popular mood this week was isaak to jia pedro or wellber to help fun salah it was reported yesterday that harand trained with the squad but he will be allowed to take compassionate leave after the death of a close family friend so theres been a bit of concern that the most own player in the game could be a doubt for g for now hollands response on social media suggests that hes got no plans to take leave the same happened last season with a family member passing pep was asked about it in the press conference and he said quote it was a tough moment for him and his family and it was sad news are thoughts of with him and his family and well see tomorrow if hes mentally and physically able to play my personal feeling is he will play and theres no risk in captain in him hell either start or probably wont play at all so just be careful with vice captaincy as always jav ellit fractured his foot during the break and hes going to be out for the foreseeable future now the main player this probably have an impact in is obis who looks a bit better for minutes k has trained three or four times for li ball now hes probably the one thats likely to come on for sal than elliot would have been some man city news from pep who conf confir that both rodri and foden are back in training and available for selection fodens only 63 owned it could be a crazy differential from gami 7 when theyve got a run of furland wolves southampton bournemouth and brighton pep also stressed in the press conference that the first three gamei of preseason v and preseason is over in the sense that theyve no longer got midweek off and theyre going to have plenty of midweek games less time to recover and train and he alluded to rotation as well also saying that players wont be playing every match so whats the latest on sanki by the way how is he still not dropped in priz anyway poa cogle said salanki improved as well and he trained the back half of this week we still have two days to go with those guys so hopefully they get through the training okay and they are available he also said that vanen trained all the way through the international break and hes ready to play in the northland and derby thanks for watching and hit subscribe if this was helpful for

26,FPLFocal,0wfY1Oy-3RM,FPL GW4 EXPERTS TEAM | WILDCARD ACTIVE! 🚀,2024-09-12T10:49:50Z,"welcome back for another video time to get back into the swing of FPL with a deadline around the corner at last so let's catch up with what the experts are doing this week with data from hundreds of top managers if you're not a channel subscriber this is the one series you cannot miss each week so make sure you're subscribed I'm off to get the focal logo tattooed as promised for 200,000 subscribers as well right after this video wish me luck let's kick off with the manager highlight then maron's moved top of the league with a huge score of 92 points which takes him up to 34k overall amazing rank this early in the season the average score in the experts League was 78 points 14 above the global average it's quite a good barometer to show how well they actually play when their average score is consistently well above the overall average flare play has got the highest score of 97 points onto trifer activity and this week 33% are going to roll the transfer 24% making one transfer 25% making two and 7% making three transfers for a minus four hereit and this week 11% have got a chip active and we've got a wild card team for one of the experts to look at later in this video so a ton of transfer activity this week who are the most popular players they're buying and selling the most transferred in player this week is Salah who 39% have picked up not surprising at all given how well he started plus he's got two home fixes ahead to Forest and Bournemouth but just how well has he started until this season the most points he'd had off three game weeks was 30 points in the 20192 season and 2122 season he's 11 clear of that currently with 41 so who's being sacrificed to fund him well it's sack who 27% of the experts have sold unless you've got 2 and a half mil or so lying around then you do need the extra funds as well which is why we're seeing so many making two or three moves Isa to xia Pedro is how many of them are funding it I mentioned in the team selection video that sacka did very well against Spurs last season he got one go one assist in the home and away games of course after that Arsenal do have Man City and they're going to be about rice and igard against Spurs they'll be about erard against City so how much of a loss is erard to Arsenal with erard and the team they've won 66.4% of games without him 52.6% 2.1 goals per game with him 1.6 goals per game without a slight drop off in shot frequency as well before the season kicked off harand was their favorite premium we have seen countless times over the years where at the end of an era comes at a club and the team takes time to adapt to a new manager maybe even culture Arsenal and man united two good examples but Liverpool hit the ground running under slot three wins in three three clean sheets in three 7.1 expected goals as well 7.1 for Man City so they're practically even at this point 31% of b sha Pedro then who has hit the ground running as well with two goals in three games and he's home to IP switch next he did travel with Brazil over the international break getting a very late call up he only played 45 minutes in total though so the hope for owners is his minutes will be unaffected 16% have bought e and 16% have bought Robertson it's an ideal entry point to buy e with a home fixure to Leicester same applies to Robertson Palace will then have another home game to man united and then Everton away it's been quite quite a few years but the Robertson and Trent double up at the back really does look strong again both have played very well and both look capable of attacking returns any game right now 5% of solding kungu and some buying Rogers who is another way to thr up that sell of money if you need it if not for a couple of big chances missed by Walkins there'd be no debate what immense value he can be 4% have cut their losses on Quant as well it actually wouldn't be surprising if he gets some starts in the coming weeks with Champions League back but his starts do look unpredictable and you wouldn't feel comfortable starting the many game week unless there's a leak which is also possible just 5% of op for wellbe of xia Pedro who could get more minutes this week given the L's international call up and lots of traveling though an only Trend we've seen in the last couple of games is well backck comes off a bit early and jaia Pedro pushes up top when they both start he plays a bit deeper with Welbeck up top welbeck's best ever goal scoring season in his 16 year Premier league history he nine goals with SH Pedro matched last season or'll be lots of pens in there both look like great picks for the next two gamic though it's still a unclear who the best for Defender is my pick in preseason was Greaves who 7% have picked up this week VIP switch's features turning nicely now nailed on at Center back moscara is a great shout as well when wolves get into an easier period though he did pick up a knock over the break just don't plan to start any of the formal Defenders if he can help it they're four mil for a reason I'm interested to know everyone's thoughts on Lewis my gut feeling is he could become a frustrating pick in the coming weeks when the schedule gets busier 10% have picked him up though but is he really going to start every week you'd be be surprised of Walker waiting for his first minutes of the Season still he's undoubtedly been brilliant though and a very reasonable pick if he's got sufficient bench cover he's someone that you need in a backline with three or four other playable Defenders ideally so how's the chip landscape looking then 11% of got their wild cut active this week which means about 79% has still got theirs the next Wild cut window that I think will be a popular one is gamix 6 which is the ideal time to load up an Arsenal assets in the likes of mumo and Harland if you don't have them foden's back in training as well could be a crazy differential soon Forza inter has got his wild cut active this week and he shared his team which is Rya fabianski dunk Davis moscara Trent Lewis Rogers e m Lis Diaz Salah jeia Pedro Harland and Jackson here's what you had to say building a wild card for gamei 4 was quite a tricky Endeavor and with hindsight may have been a slight of reaction on my part to having strong gamei 1 and two but a below aage gamic 3 nevertheless with this wild card I addressed a number of structural and Key Personnel issues within my team and I hope I'll yield some reasonable games not only over the next two game weeks but also against those managers planning to walk on gamix six this means that I've may be playing the most conservative wild cut ever but it still feels very satisfying KN that I have a revamped Squad like many managers I imagine I found myself needing to shift my gami 4 Squad towards the likes of Liverpool Brighton and others but due to highspeed car crashes named sank in gami 1 and Murphy in gami 2 I now lack the fre transfers needed to bring in the likes of Salah Trent ja Pedro M Etc more patient more skilled lesser rational fpo managers may be able to steer their Newcastle and Arsenal Laden teams towards Karma Waters without deploying the Wild Card life bone but clearly I'm not as patient as skilled or as rational as they are triple Liverpool feels right Salah trener Diaz and my pool boys the plan is for Salah and Diaz to become sackin and bumo in gamei six but I plan to keep training my team for the Long Haul as he offers ridiculously good value for 7 mil Trent is kept companied by a bunch of budget Defenders so that can load more money into the front a I will however keep faith and Rya as this price means I have exposure to the League's best defense for 5 a half million Davis Duncan Lewis leou is minut risk I know all have attack and return potential and decent fixture blocks Dunc might become a Nal defender in a couple of weeks and mcare could be grieved and stared but I prefer not to double up on a promoted size defend plus wolves have a decent fixture R somewhere down the road Beyond salar and deaz a and Rogers are long-term midfielder glue picks and I've taken the advice of many content creators by trying to make Rogers my eighth rather than seventh attacker along with Rogers Mente will Shuffle in and out of my starting 11 depending on fixtures up front har and Shia Pedro both feel like safe responsible picks but Nicholas Jackson's clearly a more risky Wild Card pun I've never owned him my expectations aren't skyh high but something gutty tells me he's capable of delivering a few surprises and he's clearly a differential pick right now my gamic for wild card with no less than three planned transfers in the weeks ahead what could go possibly wrong thanks very much for sharing and best of luck with the wild card moving on to expert's captaincy and it's just two names this week unsurprisingly Harland and Salah 82% of Captain in Harland 18% captain and sah it really is hard to separate the two given they both have home fixures and both have equal points after three game weeks the any time goal scor probabilities have Harland ahead on a 56% chance of scoring any time as Sal on 43 and a half% Watkins isn't third but he's not been seen in training yet which is something to keep an eye on if you've got him emry should give us an update in his press conference before the deadline jaia Pedro notably on 35% this week as far as the gami projections with everything factored in harland's top on 8.4 points on FP review and then Salah on 7.8 E's third on 6.2 let us know in the comments of your captain is this week onto the experts team for gamei four and there's been a few changes to the team it's Henderson in goal it's Trent conon Robinson in defense in Midfield it's Roger Salah e jotter and Smith row and it's Harland and xia Pedro up top so it's harand captain and Salah Vice Salah xia Pedra and coner join the team in place of saaka Hall and isak 11 home fishes this week looking very good this week valder Marson mun porro and Barker on the bench Smith R mun is a bit of a tossup but we've got Smith R starting here the experts ownership percentages are from last week as always but isach was actually the most known player last week in 88% of teams but given the mass sales and keeping the team of in budget Shia Pedra replaces him if there was ever a week for the team to knock out the park this has got to be it that said we know how much of a FPL can be at times mun is probably going to score a hattick on the bench and Henderson scores an own goal moving on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gamei 4 here's what they to say very Messi is not convinced by selling isak he says holding my wild card until the November International break unless there's a rash of injuries Bryson's fixures are too scary to bring in Pedro isak's form seems fine and no reason to doubt him Ash Patel took Comm maners for to sell sacka and kungu and isak for Salah Rogers and Welbeck and he says I went early on Sal in the international break cuz Inu was bleeding value I usually only take one or two hits in a season but I felt the need to get salarin and droing kungu quickly so three Tres W necessary we only two in hand I'm hoping it pays off but having to get rid of sack and EA could well come back to haunt me the football chatter was another expert of his wild cut active and he shared his thoughts he says the wild cut is active I felt like my team had been underperforming and Harlem was aive jacket keeping us up so here we are I'm looking at xia Pedro and Seena rotation they rotate quite nicely and it will allow me to play in bumo E Salah harand and hav as my front five Rogers is there as a budget option but I'm not against playing him as a philly passes the eye test as well I've got Ryan havit ready for the fixture change for Arsenal gami six and I'll Scout the impact of ard's injury on them versus Spurs and City before deciding who my third pick will be I don't want to lock in any future moves so going for Arsenal and bumo now I feel sensible so it's interesting that he's taken a very different approach to forer in's Wild Card getting the Arsenal players now possibly at the trade of of some points but saving transfers essentially

28,alwayscheating,-GjFsWPxH94,Josh&#39;s Wildcard Update &amp; Our GW4 FPL Preview,2024-09-09T13:32:22Z,all right behind the curtain before we uh before I toss it to you Josh we've got tricky trees in the comments wos Saka out and out from his team for Salah also has earling Holland but no Arsenal or brenford a gameweek six wild card only makes sense so wild card is the theme uh tricky trees we'll get to all that Josh Let's uh get right into it proper let's get proper yeah proper always cheating order I even have I have a drink today so how do you like that that's a that's a nice change sure nor yeah normally yeah you're always drinking I I rarely drink anymore but um I had some drinks yesterday and I enjoyed it so yeah it turns out drinking is uh well anyway get into that FPL after dark say that yeah exactly it's kind of is FPL after dark right uh especially now you know daylight savings time and all that stuff all right anyway hail cheaters welcome to the always treating podcast my name is Josh I'm here with Brandon Brandon how are you great what this is like a mini feeling I'm having of coming back from a summer break International break has just kind of been uh the the do drums here so I'm excited to get back to where we left off like this is a cliffhanger resolution you triggered your wild card on last week's pod and we need to know what changed where your strategies at and also what's been going on with these national team matches I mean the the whole country of Ireland has gone into hiding after Dean rice and Jack relish did did some Dirty Deeds to them so Comm commiserations to the Irish for sure um but how are how are you feeling I guess Vibe check Josh well The Vibes The Vibes are good I mean I feel like I really uh kind of checked out for a few now last week um when we did our you should go back and listen to last week's pod you haven't listened to it yet because I think it's a sort of Evergreen pod um we talked about um sort of big picture takes all 20 Premier League clubs uh covered a lot there and then I sort of revealed I hadn't told you this before the Pod that I had activated my wild card and so we we went through that of course I've changed a lot since then I feel like it's still very much in flux and I actually kind of screwed up because I made the classic wild card problem of you ever tinkered on a wild card and you took a player out as part of a tinker and then you confirmed and then you realized that player had gone up point1 without realizing it with me money okay Chris Wood so you lost whatever money you made on him were you ever going to has he increased in price since you did that he went up 0.1 and so he's he's back in the squad I'll I'll I'll share the updated updated team with you it did actually force a kind of this is the problem is you know point one is so crucial when it comes to Wild Card decisions right there's a kind of cascading effect here so yeah I think it's been a very um yeah the prely I I you know this first International break is is a toughy I feel like right because you have there's a lot going on in the sports calendar fact the Premier League sort of needs to compete in that world right you had the Wimbledon or I mean not Wimbledon you had the US Open final uh college football would have watched the Woody Allen film Wimbledon perhaps with no Premier League on sure yeah uh is that what it's called is it no it's like match point or something right there is a movie called Wimbledon with Kristen Dunst and Paul betney yes that's the one I'm thinking of yeah there's also Challengers which I saw twice in the theater that's how much I love Challengers that's amazing watch it on my TV and it was it was fine I think a lot of rules were broken in that last point but we could save that for another time we'll never know we never saw what happened after you know after after the leap the big leap at the end um all right well let's yeah so International break I would say in general when it comes to how I assess the international break is I don't really pay too much attention to um returns right I mean maybe if if there was like a super out of form player who um starts to play really well um then that might change things a little bit perhaps has scored a yeah a brace for for Sweden so yeah and it's like do we should that matter I don't really know right I mean it's like it's it's nice I guess we're looking for any clues we're in like hyper this is the this is the beginning of the season it's the beginning of the detective movie everyone's a suspect and we've got to look under every Rock here ABS absolutely and yeah turn every page right you know it's the old uh Robert Caro um Robert gly whatever author and editor yeah yeah speaking of good good films the the documentary with them is pretty good um so yeah I think um you know Trent had a man of the mat match performance uh was it yesterday for England and uh uh let's see what else Bruno scored today but again these the I just don't think these are super relevant Bruno was you know Bruno has been playing fine I mean he just hasn't been getting any any like actual FPL returns right so um so it's like does it really matter what he does in the origal stage I don't really know you know kind of the same with with um with Newcastle like I'm not you know has ESO scored in gameweek three too so it's like does it really change how I feel but I'm not exactly right I'm still kind of looking more like at fixtures I would say with with Newcastle um I guess the biggest piece of news was Joe Pedro getting called up for Brazil right as an injury replacement uh Brazil um plays their final I think it is it is just a friendly yeah it's Wednesday but I can't remember if there's like proper Stakes for that match or not I'm not actually sure that J Pedro would be expected to start that one anyway but he's certainly he's traveling for it right I I've got the foot mob open and uh there's there's no real indication that it is uh a match with Stakes we we'll we'll get back to you all on that one yeah this is something that I have like recently i' I've sort of like become a world cup Europa League like like a cup person where it's like like if there's like a proper cup I'm going to watch it I'm all in but just like random friendlies that's a pretty high bar for me these days like it's got to be a really like are you watching lots of friendlies like the even the England or like the American one until poch is there like what am I watching for you know like what am I uh it is it is just just to interject just so we're putting out the right information it is a World Cup qualifier for common ball and it's Tuesday evening that Brazil plays Paraguay got it so you we had the day and the stakes completely wrong so yeah but we we fixed it we fixed it that's true we got there I did I I did make a point of watching the US Canada match on Saturday mostly just be I hate watched because Jesse Marsh is just what a fall from grace since he left leads he's just been unable to find a home he took he took Canada to the the semifinals of the cop America as good as it's going to get for that for that guy I can tell you I can tell you this uh but are you we're just not aligned anymore you know it's whether it's the movie Challengers or Jesse Marsh's career you know there are there are always interesting threads for sure I mean going back to you know the opening of of Ireland hosting England that's always just kind of a contentious rivalry and then you've got the you know sort of the expats and and Jack and Dean uh doing the business there's always kind of something interesting and I I'll watch I'm I'm just like a sicko I'll just watch it watch any soccer match right no and I I I respect that I I just there's something the the Nations League stuff was like some kind of like sea change moment for me where I was like now they're GNA try to turn like friendlies into like a cup you know and it just I was like I can't this is like they have gone down a road I can't follow bro you know it's um so you go down that road and you tell me what the view looks like and I'll um report back it's the same view I I'll tell you that same view nothing has changed uh all right so anyway we there was a Johnny fleets asked if uh uh if the you know what what is the tail number of Ja patr return flight and we be monitor monitoring and live tweeting its progress it's like one of those coaching searches you know where like you're looking for private jets and things like that you know like um I I to me now that I know that that match is on Tuesday I would say I'm not especially concerned about Je Pedro um ahead of I mean it's not you know if they played on Friday maybe that would be one thing but I mean it's you know they play on Saturday I mean he's a it's not like he's going to rack up 180 minutes for for Brazil right and I I think it's fine I mean you know he he'll have a a late Tuesday or early Wednesday flight right I mean and presumably he's done the Brazil to England flight many many times in his life right so I don't really know what the like why that would be kind of devastating for him like I can see like if you're going to like Australia or something something like that right if you Crossing I mean they are crossing a hemisphere I don't know like I I guess I'm just not that worried about it are you worried about J Pedro I'm not worried about it uh mostly because we have gone in on ja Pedro mostly for the ripple effect across the rest of our fantasy team he is the right price and he's actually in good form most of us bought J Pedro for budgetary reasons not because we really need him to bang against I switch home IP switch home is a terrific fixture and I would prefer to get 90 minutes from ja Pedro in that fixture annoying one to miss out on yeah yeah right yes it would be annoying nonetheless uh he has been kind of a long a a midterm let's call him buy so if we only get 30 minutes out of him against ipswitch so be it I think that's a good philosop I mean ultimately there's there's only so much control uh that we have over these things so I think it's probably the right approach uh to take there I think uh we will probably get some kind of update late this week right um either something from the press conference or something um in terms of like training ground photos and things like that right like if he's if he doesn't even train with Brighton on Friday sure time to get worried right but I think otherwise you're probably fine and uh you know Eric asked if we uh overact to overreact to international travel and rason um probably I mean I think it there have been times like a couple of years ago when you had this um you know kind of after Co there was a lot of chaos when it came to like qualifying matches right and um they were trying to squeeze like three fixtures into um some of these International breaks right and so you had matches that would literally end Thursday evening and then the the club would have a a match like a Saturday morning or like you know like a the noon match on on Saturday um and uh and in those cases it what it was appropriate to over like to to react to that because you often that the the player often either wouldn't start even play right um so I think that like there are times when when it's a real thing but um I I would say you know anything that you know most the normal International window ends on a Tuesday right like in the kind of like barring anything chaotic so usually the players are back they've got a couple days to adjust and usually it's fine and I kind of feel the same way about injuries right like you're always going to get some of these like kind of minor Premier League injuries like Cole Palmer right now is flagged um and um like I to me those those are almost never a thing right like if a player suddenly gets a minor injury like a day before everyone's about to leave for international break that usually just means they trying to give them extra rest yeah they would want extra rest and you're in a hard situation there where he you wouldn't want to decline an invitation to play for your country butly you can't deine it's in everyone's interest to make up some story that is defendable so Cole Palmer injury this is just how it's going to go I haven't seen any that actually scream out to me like oh dear this is like a real warning flag yeah all right let me ask you a question um and this will be the last International break question before we move on to fpl proper what is the point of having Harry Kane start for England this weekend why why was he starting like what like he's like a mid-30s forward he is he is the most known commodity of all known Commodities I know they have a new manager but it's like isn't this a great time to give some new player like a run up front like I I don't I don't quite get that I think you underestimate the amount of power Harry Kane has in this situation you think he wants to he like he's pushing for a start there 100% he wants to yeah keep the minutes hang on to that Talisman thing as long as he can yeah okay that's fair and I guess I'm looking at who else would have it was kind of like a kind of light on forwards now that I'm looking at the squad right like they sort of they like the subs were like e Bowen Bowen was technically his his sub so maybe they were just a little short on forwards this time around and olly Watkins I think given how few minutes he's playing for Aston Villa right now and he's not quite hit his stride yeah I don't think he would have wanted to play those minutes necessarily it's more important for him to get ready for the Champions League yeah that's true uh by the way I did get tricked by a fake Fazio Romano uh Twitter feed earlier today uh that indicated that Marcus rashford was signing uh a deal to to go to a middle eastern Club the the Photoshop was that convincing that you got tricked yeah it was like it was like Fabrizio like you know was you know how it is it's like sometimes you want these things to be true right because it would be hilarious and so it's like your immediate response is like oh my God I love it and then uh and then the more rational part of your brain takes up you're like wait a second no one else is reporting on this I wonder if it's like Cameo now with fuo Romano like could we just reach out to him and PayPal him like 200 euro and and he could post whatever news we asked him to much like you would do with Cameo that is a great thing I mean that that is how he he doesn't seem to have a job right outside of tweeting so like yeah I think he probably is available for hire right like we could you imagine if we just paid him to like to tweet about our podcast I wonder if that's possible I'm sure it is I'm sure it is all right U yeah next next next week keep an eye for Fab Romano tweeting out our latest episode here we go always exactly we won't reveal how much how much we had to Fork over to make that happen uh all right so couple other quick uh news and Note updates um I thought this was kind of interesting Cole Palmer is not in Chelsea's uh European conf conference League Squad which um like I'm just a little surprised I don't know that he was going to get any starts for them but uh but it's I suppose it's a very good thing from an FPL perspective if you're looking at for for sure yeah that's that's like the level of certainty that every fantasy manager wants and I suspect they can submit a different Squad once they move into the next stage of the competition right I believe I believe that's how it works yeah in January they which presumably they will right I mean they can field uh I mean Jaden Sancho's got to play some right and so I'm sure they'll get yeah what a lad it's crazy right I mean you got Raheem Sterling at Arsenal Jaden Sono at Chelsea it's so bizarre yeah it really is um yeah I mean I will see if Chelsea can even get to the next phase of that competition who knows what what version of Chelsea shows up week to week yeah absolutely but I thought that was a that was probably ultimately good news for Chelsea they don't need him get mixed mixed up in that um so uh and then yeah might he's flagged at on the site right now but I I think it's a fairly I I didn't really I just you know I did a little bit of searching R I didn't see any real reporting on him uh having any kind of like serious issues so he should be fine yeah Ben dinery reports groin hiip SL pelvic injuries so it's all kind of in that wi bathing suit area for Mr Palmer wor yeah uh couple other updates Jared branway uh set to return to full training this week now this I at first glance you're like why is this even relevant at all but there are a number of Defenders that are shockingly cheap for Everton and if they're able to eventually turn it around uh a lot of people will be looking at some of these players on on their wild cards and uh even for myself I'm sort of I you know I I have Michael Linko in my team right now and he's not like I'm not planning to start him but 4.4 4.4 exactly you know you have Michael Keane at four million too although now I'm scared to have him with with bran R uh set a return I think yeah he's must be immediately out once uh branth W is back uh interesting I I like that I mean certainly uh can't it go on forever what you saw from Everton toward the middle and definitely by the end of the season was a team that their table position was betrayed by the points deduction that the club had to take D had them you know doing what he wanted playing playing well decently enough and and specifically defensively and a lot of that was to do with How well brane was playing so yeah I I agree I think him coming back is an interesting fantasy wrinkle yeah and I you know I don't really know um um how long it might I mean you know it's like he's just returning to training but he's been out for months so I don't know how long it'll take before he's back in in the squad but I just I you know I feel like it sounds like d is not like I think he's got a ways to go before he actually gets sacked right I think he's going to be safe for a little while so um and so I think um I don't know I just I just kind of assume still like despite what we've seen so far that he's going to figure out how to turn this thing around maybe I'm like the last person who still thinks that but I don't disagree with you at all and yeah I think Everton have bigger issues to solve than D yeah exactly their their issue is that they can't spend any money without like without getting more points deducted and so they're kind of stuck with with what they've got right um the one final news and note update I like this little maybe we start doing news and notes at the top here BR it's very handy I think to to go through the the news of the day it's like I've got a got a little newspaper feel like I'm watching Morning Joe right now yeah yeah exactly I remember James um Richardson used to do this AC Jimbo like he' do these like what's in the paper remember that he Italian 90 well that well that but also I feel like it was like maybe it was like for one of the World Cups or something he had like a big stack of newspapers videos did the guardian football podcast yeah exactly uh final piece of news is that European matches kickoff this week uh it has been very hard to follow what's going on because they literally they like just announced the fixtures a few days ago it must be like crazy booking these flights too right now that everything's announced like a week in advance and I guess they're mostly private jets but you still got to reserve a you know a like a Runway at the airport and stuff right fans the fans too you want the fans the fans are the fans are irrelevant right like they they no one cares about them at all sure the the the beer sales in The Concourse is is is is just a grain of sand compared to all the broadcast right yeah exactly they're like you you'll just do whatever we tell you to do and you know so uh but there are so first things there are no Europa or conference league matches until late September which um I somehow didn't realize until earlier today that there it's it's like a lean in on the Champions League itself until uh for the first couple weeks and so uh Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday we have Champions League matches and for all of my sort of like this is so wacky um the way that they're doing it this year it is fun to see all these matches like uh Villa play at young boys uh my favorite one one of my favorite team names and one of my favorite stadium names Brandon because it's it's the wankdorf stadium and so young I love that young boys play at the wankdorf um so that's where EST bill will be on Tuesday uh and then uh Liverpool also will play on Tuesday in the Champions League uh they travel to AC Milan so uh another really interesting match uh Wednesday Man City who always have a great every year now in the Champions League they have this amazing um amazing like easy run they host Lil on Wednesday so that' be a great chance to play the play the squad players and uh and then THD you know like I maybe they'll I'm sure Holland will start that match but and then Thursday um Arsenal uh go uh to Italy and they they'll play um Atlanta and I think that that's kind of a dangerous match for Arsenal possible banana PE type match for sure yeah and that's not it I mean we're going to be in a football coma uh By the time gameweek four gets here because efl cup is also on Tuesday and Wednesday Everton host Southampton wow brenford play Lon orian fulam away Preston Palace away QPR Manchester United host Barnes on Wednesday Spurs are away Coventry oh my God Brighton host wolves Madness good well I'm glad I I I I checked out for a few days just so I can check back in um so yeah because I I front-loaded my International break I spent a lot of time on Sunday and Monday doing um Wild Card related stuff and I would sort of um and then I I tuned out for a few days I I had my fantasy NFL draft to do um with our the there's an always cheating fantasy NFL league that our friend of the Pod Dave started and so I had to do I basically did a crash course 48 Hours of drafting uh and then as I was telling you only to draft a guy who's out for the first eight weeks of the Season uh early on so that was like Arsenal's transfer policy yeah yeah exactly I brought in Kim cstom uh followed by who was the newest guy they brought was it Marino or whoever Marino yeah yeah um I have a question for you so we're podcasting during the LA Rams Lions game Matthew Stafford plays for the Rams won a Super Bowl with him former Lions quarterback yep will Matt Stafford refuse to celebrate a touchdown if he scores one uh at Lions stadium how does that work in the NFL I think no it's not like that it's a good question but no he'll he'll celebrate maybe like the first time you know they played there but it's been a couple years now I think I think he's I think they're they're over it like the Lions actually beat them in the playoffs last year he's free to dunk the football over the goal post if he so choos absolutely I think everyone should be allowed to celebrate this idea that you can't celebrate with your you know I think it was I think it was like the Football Ramble or something they used to have a thing who was the there was a player who I I can't think of his name as an Irish forward uh but he played for like a ton of different clubs and that was like the joke is that he couldn't celebrate he couldn't celebrate any of his goals because every Club was a place he'd been at you know before um so all right so that's your news and notes section Brandon um let's do a quick look at uh my wild card here and um I'll I'll read off the team so if you're if you're watching on um you're watching on YouTube you can you can do a quick um look at our the shared screen but uh if you're if you're listening to pod uh which is still the the vast majority of people uh we still we'll talk through um all of my picks here but um so the question for me is basically um what do I want to okay actually two questions that there that are interrelated right and they are what do I want to do uh in terms of having like really expensive midfielders right like how like do I want to have one two um probably not three right probably impossible um uh do I want to have Holland and solid right and so until you resolve that question you almost can't put a team together right and so I had a team that I put together for last week's pot I had Cole Palmer in it I sort of talked myself out of Palmer again uh because I want um a little more balance in the squad he's just a little tricky at 10.6 below and behold here I am again I brought in another expensive player uh and I have um Bayo Saka uh who has who has replaced uh Cole Palmer uh he is .5 million cheaper so there is a um you know certain benefit there uh but I'll just I'm gonna read through my I'm gonna start with the Midfield first you know sometimes people do these the these discussions Brandon you usually work back to front but but the problem is the meat of the sandwich yeah you exactly you FR it with the worst part it's like if you are uh you know it's like if you were talking about an amazing sand like you said amazing sandwich and you started you know talking about the the bread I mean as the bread is the best part of the sure yeah but no one's like oh so this was the this was the style of Toothpick that they used to hold the sandwich together nobody cares what was the sandwich okay so I go through the Midfield I have I have a couple of questions after after you're done there so right now I've got uh Saka SEO e Sala Rogers as my as my Midfield five yeah H then up front I've got uh Holland Pedro and wood right so who's missing from this uh who's missing is a second Liverpool player um a better forward up front right an esac type player um I could turn Saka into um uh into Joda and use that money to turn wood into um ESO that would that would that's one option um I could uh probably find the money to turn Saka into Palmer although again 10.1 to 10.6 doesn't seem like that much it's quite a lot right it becomes very hard to you basically go from having four or five like basically having four Defenders that you can rotate to having three right it's like you basically end up having to to move into a a cheaper Defender um I did turn um uh let's see meil Smith row has turned into Morgan Rogers another way for me to save 0.5 million uh Trent has joined my team Brandon as well yeah however I had Trent and I had celba a while back and I thought geez like that feels like a lot of money for my defense like that just it feels like a bit much especially with a couple of really poor fixtures ahead for um for for Arsenal right you're not a really wealthy guy either so not a wealthy guy yeah well especially all these some of these team value mistakes I've made the last couple weeks I I think ultim I cost myself maybe like 02 so a bit dumb but um but salvageable and I I probably I have probably gotten a couple of price Rises for my transfers as well um so it's you know the question is basically uh do I really feel like I need to have two like incredibly expensive Defenders and I feel like maybe I can get away with it for now um the key player here the way I see it Josh is Bay Saka and you indicated that you now you basically you got quadruple premium if you include Trenton that Camp a triple premium attack between Salah Holland and Saka some people might wonder is this the time to go without Saka with a plan to get him back in gameweek six perhaps when there is a big fixture swing for a handful of teams yeah Saka has Spurs away followed by City away Spurs frankly I think is a is a is a good enough match for Saka I think that's yeah yeah it's it that's sort of the inverse of City Arsenal where you expect to be nil nil Spurs you expect to be like 33 uh or thereabouts so talk to me about your logic fora Now versus Saka later yeah I think that's really the question is um I I really want to have Saka for that six through eight swing um and do I really want to put myself in a position where I have to there's not going to be a way for me to do it with one transfer right so I'm I'm almost immediately locking myself into a two transfer move to bring him back in now I don't necessarily mind that right um and maybe it does make sense to go ESO Joda right and then turn ESO into um well that's a good question let me pull up the um the fixture like a a list of fixtures while we're talking here Brandon um because yeah right who would be the under the radar Strikers that might just be sort of like punt worthy for the short term is that kind of what you're thinking yeah basically yeah so like um you know I mean you could go well I mean if Ali Watkins pres you know I I just think Watkins is a little tricky now with their first you know European I mean it's not it's not the hardest match right this Champions League match but still it gives me a little bit of pause like another early sub coming in yeah it's like a dream run for Oly to go from finish in the top four last season with Billa to go to the Euros scored the career defining goal to now you're in the Champions League he's not going to want to miss that opportunity yeah so he can you know play 90 against Everton and wolves on the other hand these are the two currently the two best home fixtures back toback for Villa Everton wolves the in the calendar it switch away in in six as well right so it's it's a nice it's a really nice Trio fixtures um yeah let's see Newcastle have wolves away fulam away man city at home so two pretty good fixtures I mean better than uh better than Arsenal's fixtures over the next two right and then they do have Man City at home so it's kind of easy it's there are times when you almost want to lock yourself in to to transfers right like you it's like you almost want to force yourself to like like it's almost ideal to have a match like Man City at home in game week six right like there's no I don't want to have ESO for that I'm not auto autopay bill online it's like this money is coming out of my account on this date and now I don't have to touch it because I am a believer that like fixtures really are key right like it's it's like even even the best players will struggle in difficult fix maybe like maybe like the absolute top peak right like maybe when like with the Holland solot types there's a there there maybe there like you there are some players who are so exceptional that like it doesn't really matter what the fixtures are but those can be counted on one hand right like and I but I think in general even the best players are going to do amazing you know like fairly consistently sort of rounded out over the course of a year they're going to do amazing in good fixtures and they're going to struggle at least comparatively in in tough fixtures right and so the question is he yeah is Saka one of those players who's sort of fixture proof right in terms of just he's going to be able to deliver no matter who he's playing and um and I think that's that's really the question for me that's the question I kind of have to answer right um and so yeah so and if I went Joda um so they have forest and Bournemouth at home yeah I actually think again it's like it's such a work in progress for me right now what I want to do with with my squad because um when we potted last week I actually think I like the version of my squad I had when we did the last pod more than I like this version um well I I guess I just really I feel like maybe I think that calmer that Cole Palmer is a little bit more fixture proof um I'm a little spooked by the flag right um and I just want to make sure there's nothing there um and so I don't necessar want to have my bus team I had a more kind of balanced Squad that I was tinkering with earlier today too and that was a squad um but I just think like there's it worries me to put together a squad especially a wild card Squad that doesn't have like Elite high-end Talent right it's like it just feels like you're kind of you want those players long term right and so you don't necessarily want to like yeah get yourself in a mode where and everybody wants to do this on a wild card right you do a wild card and you want to look at game week four and um and and and be like okay whatever game week is has ahead of you welka right you want to be like this is an awesome team this this team can't lose even though we all know that like the first week after Wild Card like inevitably is a bust right but like you want you want that team that just like like bang like right out of right out of the gate get the top score of the weekend yeah exactly and I think the question for me was really um which which I think opens up and I think it's fair for someone listening to ask well why did you wild card at all Josh you know and I think the question for me is I I really wanted Mo and um yeah and I wanted more Liverpool assets and there was no way for me to get mosala without burning points and once I realized that I by doing that I was going to start rearranging my team I just thought I'm fine just doing this now right I'm fine just sort of making a bunch of changes right now and just seems like such the obvious move for everybody who doesn't have him yeah so you know it's to use the Wild Card chip instead of spending Four Points seems logical enough yeah uh given that you know the the banking of five transfers if you can do it it's like restructuring our team should in theory we haven't really seen it in practice just yet because it's too early should be easier than recent Seasons so you know wild carding for the reasons that you're explaining doesn't really seem bad or a poor strategy at all to me I yeah I'm I'm tempted myself but I think you know we'll do it for Content Josh I I will I will do what you wait a week I'll do the opposite okay think just just in one final not on the wild card because again I know we went into it quite a lot last week but um there are a couple players that I think are really easy picks for wild card one of the reasons if you don't have them it's a laser wild card and I think um Kana and and uh Anthony Robinson are both great Wild Card picks um I think Lewis dunk is an excellent Wild Card pick as well he's not my current Squad because I I can't quite afford him at the moment but I think that he is um at 4.5 an excellent pick and they have some really nice fixtures ahead as well um I just think he's he it's in previous Seasons you haven't been able to get him at this kind of discounted price right and I think a 4.5 million Center back who's going to start every match who has a little bit of goal threat is um a really useful kind of fourth Defender to have in your squad right uh yeah and and Sano is my like kind of it's it's sort of like the for me pick like he still has he still has not changed in price I don't know why I'm the only one who is excited about this guy like I think he's like I think he's absolutely fantastic and uh and then I've got e in my squad right now as well who I think is kind of a like it's a he's a by low sort of pick right he's down to 6.9 million um he's done a lot of things well and just um I mean he scored last week and got and got was it three bonus right so I mean he's he's you know he's he's off the he's off the mark already yeah and he's been unlucky to not have more returns than that has been has has been widely discussed I have a one followup question on this wild card because I think it's very interesting this season where there have been some disappointing higher priced forwards namely Watkins and ESO is kind of in that camp as well it's either Holland Holland and Jo Pedro or and your and your boy Chris Wood of course cannot forget about Chris Wood he's been great yeah so the reason I bring it up is most people wild carding now will be wild carding probably into a 352 formation and it's interesting to me like to wildcard all of the best players and somehow how that just like funnels you to a 352 and do you have have you thought at all about what the for what formation comes results from this this wild card yeah I mean at the moment it would be a kind of 352 353 rotation right like if I went with the wild card that you and I are discussing right now which I am sort of like already like I'm leaking confidence in my wild card I felt much more confident last week when you and I were talking and now I think it's I think it's the soaker thing I think you you know honestly this is why it's useful there are times when I hate sharing my wild card team on our Discord or um you know or on Twitter because I don't really want um I don't want to defend my picks especially because I there's a there's a kind of style of of like of of like responding to someone's team that I just find very grading which is always like it'll be like you'll share their team they'll be like no soand so question mark you know and that's the whole comment right uh and it's just I find it so grayy for some reason and um but I think there's you remind me of this New Yorker cartoon that I love it's a father who's putting his arm around his young son and he's kind of giving him some playground life advice and he says son if you can't say anything nice say something clever but devastating right exactly there's always that type of uh comment it's just like wow you know exactly what to to say about my wild card team to make me doubt everything yeah exactly and and and really it it really can be a house of cards putting these these squads together right you move one you like if I take Sak out right that that free up three million that I'm I'm it's going be very hard for me not to reinvest everywhere and again and the reason that I want Saka long term is because it's just a really tricky it's very tricky to handle Arsenal assets correctly I think right now because they have a really tough gameweek four and gameweek five right North and Derby and four man City away in game week five then they have a spectacular run from gameweeks 6 to8 um let's see if I can take a quick look at it here it's uh yeah Lester at home Southampton at home Bournemouth away right amazing run uh but then uh in game weeks nine and 10 they have uh uh Liverpool and Newcastle Newcastle away in game week 10 so tough fixtures and then you factor in a bunch of European Champions League matches for them as well and it suddenly does not seem hugely appealing to have Assets Now once that's over once they've sort of gone through the kind of Gauntlet of really tough fixtures their run from a game week 11 out is amazing and I think that if you have not wild carded yet I think and you're sort of gonna try to get by with like one Arsenal asset um one or two um I do think wild carding to sort of get your ideal Arsenal 3 you know between game weeks 10 and 11 does make a lot of sense I think that would be um you know one one route that's that's that's out there so I think that's that's honestly where I'm leaning right now knockwood so nothing devastating happens to my squad but I want to probably move Saka to Sala for free uh once the game week four deadline passes and then yeah try to try to work out through free transfers that fixture shift in game w six and the Wild Card around that time so that's that's the road I'm walking yep yeah and I think that I think that makes a lot of sense so um so that's that's my squad uh more more to come we'll we'll talk more on the patreon pod on Thursday as we get more information about some of these players um and speaking of patreon uh Brandon what a great tie in there uh good patreon.com cheating is where you can go to uh support the podcast and say thank you to the cheaters uh we do

postgame week thoughts Brandon the Monday su's Tuesday I'm trying to do them after all of the matches have been completed for the week so uh but quick thoughts on the matches so you can go to um I think it's always cheating. substack docomo let's get into gameweek four though we have um uh what I like to call a FPL classic you know I love a uh I love an a classic Premier League weekend Brandon where you just have matches on Saturday this is a a true a true classic in the way Brandon because you have just you have eight matches on Saturday followed by two on Sunday just two matches on Sunday is it is it is it Beyond a classic now because there is a late kickoff on Saturday oh super classic yeah I like it it's of like class it's like a rum and coke basically what we've got going on this weekend I like the late match by the way it's it's a fun one because uh in America this this means you really could do nothing all day but watch the watch the premier league right Don't Mind If I Do Don't Mind If I Do yeah exactly in theory it's with the with the 12:30 start in England you could get up and do something with you take your kids to to to I don't know basketball practice and um it's like the NFL here on Sundays right you can do you can do a bunch go to church Brandon I know you love to get in a couple Church sessions in the mornings if you can so just bang them out you know whenever possible my reps in get your reps in uh but yeah you know but now yeah 7:30 10: A.M 12:30 and what's what's what what window am i g to skip I guess maybe Villa Everton that's although even that you know has some pretty big fantasy got back your boy Morgan Rogers I've got a a sneaking suspicion he's gonna make the cut going you know what it is unfortunately it's the it's the Southampton it's the early match on Sat Saturday Southampton hosty man united I think that's the one that I will sadly be SK just nobody's going to have players in that match I know I know I mean some will still have well I mean I think like the statistically inclined may still have Bruno Bruno right he's still doing quite well on the stat tables and stuff but um yeah uh and and it is a great I mean it's a great match for you know in theory and he did score today I don't know maybe there's something there the content Gods cannot help themselves with Manchester United I predict a 2-1 Southampton Victory here it does feel like it might be southampton's first win of the season I I'm I'm kind of inclined to agree it feels like the momentum to get ten out of there it's all here like you know there's United star players coming back from an international break what's going on y do they even receive any coaching wisdom from ten hog at this point I don't know I I don't know either I really don't know what's uh like I don't know what he's doing anymore I don't know why I I guess it's like all the ownership stuff has to get resolved you the the Detroit Pistons went through this a few years ago when their owner died and there was like this big ownership takeover it was like nothing happened for like five years because it was just like the everything that was happening with the ownership just sort of took precedence right and there there's no real kind of Steward stewardship yes of things so um but yeah I think the big question we have a couple of questions about um about the game week and I think you know the big one um is from tberry and he says Captain Holland or Salah they both have good fixtures do we go with the Norwegian Legion or the Egyptian magician are these are those real nicknames I egptian let's see real Liverpool die hards would probably not relinquish the magician from coutinho Who Bore that moniker for some time that's right but listen we we're not here to be pedantic we actually hate that stuff I know cheting so if you want to call him the magician go with Go With It Go Go With It yeah you doing do another religious reference you wanted to say go with go yeah um I think um okay I guess the question is is there a uh a like s oh almost stuttered up with my words there Brandon is there a statistical like thing that you could like you know like are there statistical things that you would look at to make this decision or does it really come down to feel right you've got Man City hosting brenford you have Liverpool hosting Forest yeah uh brenford and Forest are both sorry just a finished the set brenford and Forest are both quality mid-table clubs well coached have a little bit of talent uh defenses are fine right like uh not great um but not terrible um again you could look at data points we're three weeks into the season like what's you know I'm not sure that there are like hugely telling points of data at this point to tell you whether like one Squad is you know whether one defense is considerably worse than the other right or whether it's reliable enough information so um yeah so what do you think like you know just a I think it's less statistical and more Personnel based for me and that that takes me more to Holland because I think Forest have been able to play I'm just thinking of the fullbacks honestly the wide play Forest have been able to play with uh I think there's still betting in some new signings but I like that wide defense a bit more and it feels more stable and brenford it still makeshift with the injury to Rico Henry and the entire back line and you know we just don't rate uh flecken super highly I it just the Personnel that City are going up against defensively augers for a a Holland captaincy in my mind yeah um I I I in general I'm just I'm GNA default to Holland in basically any scenario because I just feel like he is um I I do think the man city are the best team in the Premier League uh you know maybe Arsenal will maybe Arsenal will be someday but how about how about Arsenal actually beat them in the Premier League one year before we call them the best team right like I you know so I mean they just dropped points at home to to Brighton like I don't know why you know like let's let's like there's no Arsenal are in a better position as the underdog anyway right they don't need um anyone calling them the best team at this point um so I think the man city are the best team and they have designed I I feel I say this every podcast but it really is important to to punch home all the time which is that the best team in the Premier League has designed an attack to create chances for this giant of a man this you know this this this kind of unusually tall unusually fast unusually accurate forward right who kind of has everything that that you want and they have a pretty easy uh Champions relatively easy champion match at midweek as well there's just no reason in my opinion to you know and I I guess the the argument for Salah if I were to make one would be I mean certainly you can make one uh is that there is um he it's it's more likely that he's going to get assist right so there's more like it it could be that the absolute absolute top top high-end return for mosala is somewhere in the 20s whereas maybe for Holland it's more like two or three goals right and so maybe it's closer like maybe his his upper range is 13 to 17 points and Holland's upper range is 12 to 23 I you know whatever like somewhere it's like a little higher but I think that yeah it's so strange to me that uh is strange to the right word Holland has scored seven goals through three ma three match weeks yeah Sal has scored three he's got three goals and three assists Holland has to score hattricks to keep up with Sal's just yeah rate of general xgi not xgi but just GI his GI tracked is what I'm following I'm following them more closely than the flights Brandon I want to make sure that he's doing doing well eating well absolutely yur an ostomy bag if keep producing at this this R we have a great we have a there's a couple of great yogurt companies here in the United States and so I've been sending him FJ and uh what's the other one there's another one that's up chani ch oh he's getting a lot of lot of chabani too and uh and then I'm actually I'm from Iceland I'm sending over the siggies as well so he's got a I don't think it's gilfy Curson company I I hope there's no connection there there's a lot of people with very similar names in Iceland right so yeah yeah so what what is more sustainable the way Salah is getting these goals and assists or Holland getting hat tricks every match week now they're both exactly as sustainable it's like right and it's not that Holland has is is getting hattricks he has scored in every match this Premier League season so I would just think of it I would boil it down to more essential parts and that Holland and Salah are both returning every game we and that doesn't have to be a little more complex than that I think the the point for Salah is that he apparently has more routes to fantasy points because he does as you were saying have assists in his quiver and that's that's good so longterm it's solo looks like he might be winning out by gameweek 38 over Holland yeah uh I do think that there's I I think that there there are there are going to be weeks when when there's a better case for Salah right I think uh gameweek five I think is an example of that right in gameweek five you're going to have uh Man City and Arsenal play each other and despite the slander that I just directed towards Arsenal a minute ago I think that that's going to be a extreme difficult match in game week five even with Man City at home uh and that same week Liverpool host Bournemouth so that week it's an easy decision right uh there's right I I think it's because I I I rate forest and brenford to a certain degree I would say that I rate uh do I rate Forest defense their defense is okay I don't know I mean I do I rate either team's defense not really I think that both teams and well I think the real question is you know I think both teams have enough attacking potential that they will maybe keep the other team like they're not going to like I don't think either team is going to play seven defenders in the Box what or you know what I mean they're not gonna like just absolutely park the bus and and and try I I I don't know burnford in particular have shown an ability to go to tricky away matches and and get returns you know from them and so I think that um I think that you know they could they could do something um and even Forest have like a little bit of um you know there's some real talent in that for a squad too right so I think they could they could um give you both teams could could give the other one a a run well yeah that that's it like what's the game State going to be through much of these fixtures is maybe another way to think about it yeah game state city brenford is City are going to be uh in have like 100% possession yeah and brenford will occasionally Counterattack and I think Liverpool Forest honestly probably the same the same I think brenford have a of scoring in that match I would give them a pretty good shot at that but um all right so that's I I think it's I think it's really tricky I think we've made I think both of us are just realistically on Holland and and that's just you know how it's going to be I mean if you had Salo would you consider it more strongly do you think or you I feel like you'd still be on Hollands even if you it would be tempting um I think I would just because that's assuming I'm me and I have captained Holland the last three game weeks and I've captained two hattricks I feel good about that if I had hadn't had if I had Captain Salah the last couple of game weeks I'm probably just like going with what's working for my team if that makes sense all right here's another question from Crim Trent Crim I think Brandon from the Independent he says is it crazy to double up on jota and Louise with a free transfer before transitioning to Salah on a wild card this is one of those very specific team questions that I don't have't put on the podcast but I think it is I think it it does get to something that I think is interesting which is um is does a Joda and Louise double up kind of equal one mosala or can it like can it do in a pinch right it's not not easy for everybody to get to mosala unfortunately right yeah guess the problem with this tactic is always like we've seen with jot versus Diaz is one's going to score and the other is gonna blank so who are you giving up to have both of these guys so I mean I guess I guess if you're giving up like one of these unreliable Smith bro Bruno types or whatever right you know it's yeah you're probably I'm fine with it sure it sounds cool I I think the the the general gist of Liverpool is they're playing incredibly well they have faith in this new manager everyone's informed so uh everyone's a buy all right well what about uh what about your squad going into game week four what are are you the plan right now is to hold your transfer um can I can I see can I see what your I want to see with my own eyes what your Kelly Squad looks like I'm gonna throw it up on the YouTube and I'll talk everybody through uh what what we're looking at on the podcast here so uh oh there you go we're at the the homepage that's great it's great so I've got Dean Henderson and go uh finally Palace have a defense a decent defensive fixture Lester at home so looking forward to that VY hatrick score yeah Anthony Robinson Home West Ham easy celba Spurs away don't love it but I'll start him anyway uh it's it's sort of like do you start celba or pedoro do you start both no I'm not starting both I sort of a classic just go with the better team and I I like Spurs to score but I do think Arsenal are the better team and we'll have the better of it so we just go with that logic and then cona at home with another great fixture with Everton across the Midfield Anthony Gordon away away wolves I think Anthony Gordon finally scored an away goal a couple of game weeks ago so so now he's very playable I don't yeah I was wondering if that was like if somebody was like if you were in a position where you were planning to Wild Card in gameweek five then I actually think you'd be in a position where the question that we just had would have at least a like I think it would be a reasonable move right going going Gordon to um like um DS DS in your case right I don't think that would be like that that to me would be like plus EV like there's some expected value in that move for sure I I I think I like it yeah potentially I think the way the non wild card for me and the low quantity of Liverpool players I'm it it works well for me if somehow Forest are able to mute Liverpool and Newcastle have an explosive match because I think people are getting away from Gordon and esok and if Gordon and esak create points then great I have gotten to Salah basically without by escaping damage there and that's really what I'm hoping for my the the big question I have with my squad is I've got jaia Pedro esak and Holland across the front I have benched more Morgan Rogers who do I drop to bring Morgan Rogers in Smith row if I look at my team Smith R feels like the one least likely to has the lowest ceiling perhaps than all of these guys Jia Pedro we have discussed his travel coming back from South America how many minutes can we expect from him then uh then there's Morgan Rogers who hasn't even produced any fantasy points so how does he get into this starting 11 just based on itest alone so right now I've got Rogers on the bench as well as Pedro poro and Vace so I don't know what do you thinko bench makes sense um you know I mean it's actually an interesting one celba versus poro as a as a debate I mean I think um I think I would I I think I would start S over porro as well um right but porro clearly had has the attacking assets that CBA does not so you just go with the attacking Defender yeah but I I mean I think I would no but I think I would still go as sleep because I think that Arsenal have a better chance of keeping a clean sheet in that match and I think I do think that there's a pretty good chance that the Spurs scor but I don't see them scoring multiple goals right so then it's like you've got to kind of drop a scenario where they score one goal and that goal has a poor return attached to it right so I and and it feels very like that Arsenal are going to score a couple in this match right so it's sort of um yeah so anyway I think you've got that one right I think I would probably start Smith row over Rogers as well and I guess I'm sort of with you even though I have uh I was debating Smith row and Rogers On My Own wild card and I went with Rogers that's mostly because of the price right it's a 04.5 million savings there and um you know I just think that um they're close enough and I and I guess the the hope that he eventually starts returning but um but yeah we haven't seen it yet and they have the um the champions league is there any chance that Rogers starts to get some rests ahead of some of these Champions League matches I don't know right because I I you know I don't think that um Emory is just gonna you know not try in the Premier League because he's so focused in the Champions League I don't I don't think that's what anybody wants or expects right so um so I I think it's pretty close I think um and I also think when when stuff like this is close enough it's it's like you should probably don't need to sweat it too much right because it's just like it's really hard to say who's better between the two of them this is where I know I know you're not like you don't do this but you know they have these Sports books in Canada Brandon you can uh you know pull one up and see who's got the better score assist prop right and um you know those are all algorithmically driven right so it's like take a look and see what you know um what Vegas thinks or whatever right and uh uh and maybe that's you know how you make your sure yeah I'm not I'm not about that at all for sure yeah so it's I think it's a tricky week for benching and we'll we'll be accumulating press presser knowledge as we get closer to the weekend do we get anything from the managers on players comment back Etc but yeah this is where I'm at I don't know how I ended up with this Vice captaincy on Jiao Pedro that was before his Brazil call up I guess um I guess you got to go Joda there right yeah all right we'll make a live Vice Captain's pick here right on the pond and we'll save our team right there uh beautiful always set your bus team everybody you never know when disaster could strike to quickly go back to the question about the double up if you're if you're wild carding next week I actually think that uh I would probably lean towards e if I if I wanted a one-week punt on a um on a on a player uh like if I basically was playy the Wild Card in five no matter what um I think that it you know I think he scored the goal he got in for England which I think is probably a confidence booster for for him uh and they play Lester at home um I think that it's he's been taking so many shots um it just feels like he's kind of right for like a really big match um I me I just got double digit returns in game make three so um you know it's I like that my general preference is to diversify and not double up so I'm I'm with you on that one too all right well let's let's wrap things up here um a a little early this week but this is you know this is the second pod of the international break it's we're sort of um we need new Brandon we need new news uh so let's say uh if you could only pick uh let's say you're busy this week Brandon maybe you're traveling for your kids have uh have some um I don't know rugby practice this weekend Brandon you gota you gotta you got to go to a rugger tournament all right it's goingon to take up your whole weekend you can record one game and watch it Saturday evening you know on your iPad in your hotel room uh what's the one match that you're going to watch this weekend what's the best what's the most fun match not necess the FPL match but the most fun I do think it could Fulham West Ham I there's something about how this West Ham team is taking shape where they're just like a real wild card just like an unexpected team a weird team yeah and Fulham have you know they feel like they've had a good transfer window but I don't think they have really sort of coalesced and are as unified a team as we saw with Fulham last season so I think this could be a real shootout uh at at the cottage yeah uh and I think that this FM team is kind of fun it's they're they're really in transition right now and it's sort of interesting I think that they're fun to watch to I guess if I were to pick one match to watch this week it would probably be the Liverpool Forest match I think well of well obviously we have the the north Lon Derby on Sunday I guess I was sort of looking at the Saturday pictures but that that's like almost too easy right obviously obviously yeah if you're watch watch the north London der I think that that North London derage is gonna be great absolutely I think that'll be great too but just looking at the the Saturday fixtures again I'm I mean I was like I I I went so far with my metaphor that I really was EnV visioning the the per like I had an image in my head of this 47y old uh mother of three Brandon who's listening to the podcast right now and this is this is her one chance to break away right and she's going to she got the the Bluetooth headphones plugg into the iPad exactly kids are in the other bed you know raising a Ruckus and she's gonna get a awayer watching Metro so but I'm I'm really curious I want to see what I want to see if Liverpool can keep this thing going right I want to see if they it's fascinating to me with with the new manager and whether they can keep it up and whether Salah can keep delivering and they're just it's it's a it's a fun version of the squad it's more fun honestly than I was expecting uh the post clop era to be I thought there'd be more of an adjustment um now of course you know may not last but at the moment I I think it's really fun and I I do think this forest team has shown some um some spark too I don't grit even yeah some grit and like I don't you know I I just it seems like they're I don't think they're I don't even think they're really quite good enough to necessarily like challenge for a European conference League spider like that but but I think that they're the kind of squad that have enough Talent like I think you know Morgan Gibbs white in particular I think is really good and been fun to watch and so they sort of it's like it's not your classic good team versus bad team kind of match I think that for could give them some trouble so uh yeah and then of course Sunday we have the north L Derby I I think those are I find those matches very hard to predict in general right I think uh a lot of results are on the table um I guess if I were to go with like a really boring pick be something like 21 Arsenal um but you know I'll go 32 Arsenal 32 Arsenal yeah somewhere in that range both teams scoring I could see either team winning but I think Arsenal probably have a little more kind of they're a little more organized right now like a little more kind of stable up front it feels like they are more likely to score two goals in the match um so yeah that's your that's your pod for this week we'll be back on Thursday with our patreon pod uh we'll be talking through wild cards maybe Brandon will have been Vin to drop um anth you know Taylor like not Anthony no what's his name Anthony Taylor Anthony Taylor yeah yeah exactly Anthony Gordon thank you Anthony Gordon uh like a bad habit we'll see and uh we'll see what else is going on so we'll probably have some breaking news and some

toss it to you josh weve got tricky trees in the comments wos saka out and out from his team for salah also has earling holland but no arsenal or brenford a gw six wild card only makes sense so wild card is the theme tricky trees well get to all that josh lets get right into it proper lets get proper proper always cheating order i even have i have a drink today so how do you like thats a thats a nice change sure nor normally youre always drinking i rarely drink anymore but i had some drinks yesterday and i enjoyed it so it turns out drinking is well anyway get into that fpl after dark say that exactly its is fpl after dark right especially now daylight savings time and all that stuff all right anyway hail cheaters welcome to the always treating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you great what this is like a mini feeling im having of coming back from a summer break international break has just been the do drums here so im excited to get back to where we left off like this is a cliffhanger resolution you triggered your wild card on last weeks pod and we need to know what changed where your strategies at and also whats been going on with these national team matches the whole country of ireland has gone into hiding after dean rice and jack relish did some dirty deeds to them so comm commiserations to the irish for sure but how are how are you feeling vibe check josh well the vibes the vibes are good i feel like i checked out for a few now last week when we did our you should go back and listen to last weeks pod you havent listened to it yet because i think its a evergreen pod we talked about big picture takes all 20 premier league clubs covered a lot there and then i revealed i hadnt told you this before the pod that i had activated my wild card and so we went through that of course ive changed a lot since then i feel like its still in flux and i screwed up because i made the classic wild card problem of you ever tinkered on a wild card and you took a player out as part of a tinker and then you confirmed and then you realized that player had gone up point1 without realizing it with me money okay chris wood so you lost whatever money you made on him were you ever going to has he increased in price since you did that he went up 01 and so hes hes back in the squad ill ill ill share the updated team with you it did force a this is the problem is point one is so crucial when it comes to wild card decisions right theres a cascading effect here so i think its been a very the prely i this first international break is a toughy i feel like right because you have theres a lot going on in the sports calendar fact the premier league needs to compete in that world right you had the wimbledon or not wimbledon you had the us open final college football would have watched the woody allen film wimbledon perhaps with no premier league on sure is that what its called is it no its like match point right there is a movie called wimbledon with kristen dunst and paul betney yes thats the one im thinking of theres also challengers which i saw twice in the theater thats how much i love challengers thats amazing watch it on my tv and it was it was fine i think a lot of rules were broken in that last point but we could save that for another time well never know we never saw what happened after after the leap the big leap at the end all right well lets so international break i would say in general when it comes to how i assess the international break is i dont pay too much attention to returns right maybe if there was like a super out of form player who starts to play well then that might change things a little bit perhaps has scored a a brace for sweden so and its like do we should that matter i dont know right its like its its nice were looking for any clues were in like hyper this is the this is the beginning of the season its the beginning of the detective movie everyones a suspect and weve got to look under every rock here abs absolutely and turn every page right its the old robert caro robert gly whatever author and editor speaking of good films the documentary with them is pretty good so i think trent had a man of the mat match performance was it yesterday for england and lets see what else bruno scored today but again these the i just dont think these are super relevant bruno was bruno has been playing fine he just hasnt been getting any like actual fpl returns right so so its like does it matter what he does in the origal stage i dont know the same with with newcastle like im not has eso scored in gw three too so its like does it change how i feel but im not exactly right im still looking more like at fixtures i would say with newcastle the biggest piece of news was joe pedro getting called up for brazil right as an injury replacement brazil plays their final i think it is it is just a friendly its wednesday but i cant remember if theres like proper stakes for that match or not im not sure that j pedro would be expected to start that one anyway but hes certainly hes traveling for it right ive got the foot mob open and theres theres no real indication that it is a match with stakes well well get back to you all on that one this is something that i have like recently i ive like become a world cup europa league like a cup person where its like if theres like a proper cup im going to watch it im all in but just like random friendlies thats a pretty high bar for me these days like its got to be a like are you watching lots of friendlies like the even the england or like the american one until poch is there like what am i watching for like what am i it is it is just to interject just so were putting out the right information it is a world cup qualifier for common ball and its tuesday evening that brazil plays paraguay got it so you we had the day and the stakes completely wrong so but we fixed it we fixed it thats true we got there i did i did make a point of watching the us canada match on saturday mostly just be i hate watched because jesse marsh is just what a fall from grace since he left leads hes just been unable to find a home he took he took canada to the semifinals of the cop america as good as its going to get for that for that guy i can tell you i can tell you this but are you were just not aligned anymore its whether its the movie challengers or jesse marshs career there are there are always interesting threads for sure going back to the opening of ireland hosting england thats always just a contentious rivalry and then youve got the the expats and jack and dean doing the business theres always something interesting and ill watch im im just like a sicko ill just watch it watch any soccer match right no and i respect that i just theres something the nations league stuff was like some like sea change moment for me where i was like now theyre gna try to turn like friendlies into like a cup and it just i was like i cant this is like they have gone down a road i cant follow bro its so you go down that road and you tell me what the view looks like and ill report back its the same view ill tell you that same view nothing has changed all right so anyway we there was a johnny fleets asked if if the what is the tail number of ja patr return flight and we be monitor monitoring and live tweeting its progress its like one of those coaching searches where like youre looking for private jets and things like that like i to me now that i know that match is on tuesday i would say im not especially concerned about je pedro ahead of its not if they played on friday maybe that would be one thing but its they play on saturday hes a its not like hes going to rack up 180 minutes for brazil right and i think its fine hell have a late tuesday or early wednesday flight right and presumably hes done the brazil to england flight many times in his life right so i dont know what the like why that would be devastating for him like i can see like if youre going to like australia something like that right if you crossing they are crossing a hemisphere i dont know like i im just not that worried about it are you worried about j pedro im not worried about it mostly because we have gone in on ja pedro mostly for the ripple effect across the rest of our fantasy team he is the right price and hes in good form most of us bought j pedro for budgetary reasons not because we need him to bang against i switch home ip switch home is a terrific fixture and i would prefer to get 90 minutes from ja pedro in that fixture annoying one to miss out on right yes it would be annoying nonetheless he has been a long a midterm lets call him buy so if we only get 30 minutes out of him against ipswitch so be it i think thats a good philosop ultimately theres theres only so much control that we have over these things so i think its probably the right approach to take there i think we will probably get some update late this week right either something from the press conference in terms of like training ground photos and things like that right like if hes if he doesnt even train with brighton on friday sure time to get worried right but i think otherwise youre probably fine and eric asked if we overact to overreact to international travel and rason probably i think it there have been times like a couple of years ago when you had this after co there was a lot of chaos when it came to like qualifying matches right and they were trying to squeeze like three fixtures into some of these international breaks right and so you had matches that would end thursday evening and then the club would have a match like a saturday morning or like like a the noon match on saturday and and in those cases it what it was appropriate to over like to react to that because you often that the player often either wouldnt start even play right so i think that like there are times when its a real thing but i would say anything that most the normal international window ends on a tuesday right like in the like barring anything chaotic so usually the players are back theyve got a couple days to adjust and usually its fine and i feel the same way about injuries right like youre always going to get some of these like minor premier league injuries like cole palmer right now is flagged and like i to me those are almost never a thing right like if a player suddenly gets a minor injury like a day before everyones about to leave for international break that usually just means they trying to give them extra rest they would want extra rest and youre in a hard situation there where he you wouldnt want to decline an invitation to play for your country butly you cant deine its in everyones interest to make up some story that is defendable so cole palmer injury this is just how its going to go i havent seen any that scream out to me like dear this is like a real warning flag all right let me ask you a question and this will be the last international break question before we move on to fpl proper what is the point of having harry kane start for england this weekend why was he starting like what like hes like a mid30s forward he is he is the most known commodity of all known commodities i know they have a new manager but its like isnt this a great time to give some new player like a run up front like i dont i dont quite get that i think you underestimate the amount of power harry kane has in this situation you think he wants to he like hes pushing for a start there 100 he wants to keep the minutes hang on to that talisman thing as long as he can okay thats fair and im looking at who else would have it was like a light on forwards now that im looking at the squad right like they they like the subs were like e bowen was technically his sub so maybe they were just a little short on forwards this time around and olly watkins i think given how few minutes hes playing for aston villa right now and hes not quite hit his stride i dont think he would have wanted to play those minutes necessarily its more important for him to get ready for the champions league thats true by the way i did get tricked by a fake fazio romano twitter feed earlier today that indicated that marcus rashford was signing a deal to go to a middle eastern club the photoshop was that convincing that you got tricked it was like it was like fabrizio like was how it is its like sometimes you want these things to be true right because it would be hilarious and so its like your immediate response is like my god i love it and then and then the more rational part of your brain takes up youre like wait a second no one else is reporting on this i wonder if its like cameo now with fuo romano like could we just reach out to him and paypal him like 200 euro and he could post whatever news we asked him to much like you would do with cameo that is a great thing that is how he doesnt seem to have a job right outside of tweeting so like i think he probably is available for hire right like we could you imagine if we just paid him to like to tweet about our podcast i wonder if thats possible im sure it is im sure it is all right u next week keep an eye for fab romano tweeting out our latest episode here we go always exactly we wont reveal how much how much we had to fork over to make that happen all right so couple other quick news and note updates i thought this was interesting cole palmer is not in chelseas european conf conference league squad which like im just a little surprised i dont know that he was going to get any starts for them but but its its a very good thing from an fpl perspective if youre looking at for sure thats thats like the level of certainty that every fantasy manager wants and i suspect they can submit a different squad once they move into the next stage of the competition right i believe i believe thats how it works in january they which presumably they will right they can field jaden sanchos got to play some right and so im sure theyll get what a lad its crazy right you got raheem sterling at arsenal jaden sono at chelsea its so bizarre it is i will see if chelsea can even get to the next phase of that competition who knows what version of chelsea shows up week to week absolutely but i thought that was a that was probably ultimately good news for chelsea they dont need him get mixed up in that so and then might hes flagged at on the site right now but i think its a fairly i didnt i just i did a little bit of searching r i didnt see any real reporting on him having any like serious issues so he should be fine ben dinery reports groin hiip sl pelvic injuries so its all in that wi bathing suit area for mr palmer wor couple other updates jared branway set to return to full training this week now this i at first glance youre like why is this even relevant at all but there are a number of defenders that are shockingly cheap for everton and if theyre able to eventually turn it around a lot of people will be looking at some of these players on their wild cards and even for myself im i i have michael linko in my team right now and hes not like im not planning to start him but 444 exactly you have michael keane at four million too although now im scared to have him with bran r set a return i think hes must be immediately out once branth w is back interesting i like that certainly cant it go on forever what you saw from everton toward the middle and definitely by the end of the season was a team that their table position was betrayed by the points deduction that the club had to take d had them doing what he wanted playing well decently enough and specifically defensively and a lot of that was to do with how well brane was playing so i agree i think him coming back is an interesting fantasy wrinkle and i i dont know how long it might its like hes just returning to training but hes been out for months so i dont know how long itll take before hes back in the squad but i just i i feel like it sounds like d is not like i think hes got a ways to go before he gets sacked right i think hes going to be safe for a little while so and so i think i dont know i just i just assume still like despite what weve seen so far that hes going to figure out how to turn this thing around maybe im like the last person who still thinks that but i dont disagree with you at all and i think everton have bigger issues to solve than d exactly their issue is that they cant spend any money without like without getting more points deducted and so theyre stuck with what theyve got right the one final news and note update i like this little maybe we start doing news and notes at the top here br its very handy i think to go through the news of the day its like ive got a got a little newspaper feel like im watching morning joe right now exactly i remember james richardson used to do this ac jimbo like he do these like whats in the paper remember that he italian 90 well that well that but also i feel like it was like maybe it was like for one of the world cups he had like a big stack of newspapers videos did the guardian football podcast exactly final piece of news is that european matches kickoff this week it has been very hard to follow whats going on because they they like just announced the fixtures a few days ago it must be like crazy booking these flights too right now that everythings announced like a week in advance and theyre mostly private jets but you still got to reserve a a like a runway at the airport and stuff right fans the fans too you want the fans the fans are the fans are irrelevant right like they no one cares about them at all sure the beer sales in the concourse is just a grain of sand compared to all the broadcast right exactly theyre like youll just do whatever we tell you to do and so but there are so first things there are no europa or conference league matches until late september which i somehow didnt realize until earlier today that there its its like a lean in on the champions league itself until for the first couple weeks and so tuesday wednesday and thursday we have champions league matches and for all of my like this is so wacky the way that theyre doing it this year it is fun to see all these matches like villa play at young boys my favorite one of my favorite team names and one of my favorite stadium names brandon because its its the wankdorf stadium and so young i love that young boys play at the wankdorf so thats where est bill will be on tuesday and then liverpool also will play on tuesday in the champions league they travel to ac milan so another interesting match wednesday man city who always have a great every year now in the champions league they have this amazing amazing like easy run they host lil on wednesday so that be a great chance to play the play the squad players and and then thd like i maybe theyll im sure holland will start that match but and then thursday arsenal go to italy and theyll play atlanta and i think thats a dangerous match for arsenal possible banana pe type match for sure and thats not it were going to be in a football coma by the time gw four gets here because efl cup is also on tuesday and wednesday everton host southampton wow brenford play lon orian fulam away preston palace away qpr man utd host barnes on wednesday spurs are away coventry my god brighton host wolves madness good well im glad i checked out for a few days just so i can check back in so because i frontloaded my international break i spent a lot of time on sunday and monday doing wild card related stuff and i would and then i tuned out for a few days i had my fantasy nfl draft to do with our the theres an always cheating fantasy nfl league that our friend of the pod dave started and so i had to do i did a crash course 48 hours of drafting and then as i was telling you only to draft a guy whos out for the first eight weeks of the season early on so that was like arsenals transfer policy exactly i brought in kim cstom followed by who was the newest guy they brought was it marino or whoever marino i have a question for you so were podcasting during the la rams lions game matthew stafford plays for the rams won a super bowl with him former lions quarterback yep will matt stafford refuse to celebrate a touchdown if he scores one at lions stadium how does that work in the nfl i think no its not like that its a good question but no hell hell celebrate maybe like the first time they played there but its been a couple years now i think i think hes i think theyre theyre over it like the lions beat them in the playoffs last year hes free to dunk the football over the goal post if he so choos absolutely i think everyone should be allowed to celebrate this idea that you cant celebrate with your i think it was i think it was like the football ramble they used to have a thing who was the there was a player who i cant think of his name as an irish forward but he played for like a ton of different clubs and that was like the joke is that he couldnt celebrate he couldnt celebrate any of his goals because every club was a place hed been at before so all right so thats your news and notes section brandon lets do a quick look at my wild card here and ill ill read off the team so if youre if youre watching on youre watching on youtube you can you can do a quick look at our the shared screen but if youre if youre listening to pod which is still the vast majority of people we still well talk through all of my picks here but so the question for me is what do i want to okay two questions that there that are interrelated right and they are what do i want to do in terms of having like expensive midfielders right like how like do i want to have one two probably not three right probably impossible do i want to have holland and solid right and so until you resolve that question you almost cant put a team together right and so i had a team that i put together for last weeks pot i had cole palmer in it i talked myself out of palmer again because i want a little more balance in the squad hes just a little tricky at 106 below and behold here i am again i brought in another expensive player and i have bayo saka who has who has replaced cole palmer he is 5m cheaper so there is a certain benefit there but ill just im gonna read through my im gonna start with the midfield first sometimes people do these the these discussions brandon you usually work back to front but the problem is the meat of the sandwich you exactly you fr it with the worst part its like if you are its like if you were talking about an amazing sand like you said amazing sandwich and you started talking about the bread as the bread is the best part of the sure but no ones like so this was the this was the style of toothpick that they used to hold the sandwich together nobody cares what was the sandwich okay so i go through the midfield i have i have a couple of questions after youre done there so right now ive got saka seo e sala rogers as my as my midfield five h then up front ive got holland pedro and wood right so whos missing from this whos missing is a second liverpool player a better forward up front right an esac type player i could turn saka into into joda and use that money to turn wood into eso that would that would thats one option i could probably find the money to turn saka into palmer although again 101 to 106 doesnt seem like that much its quite a lot right it becomes very hard to you go from having four or five like having four defenders that you can rotate to having three right its like you end up having to move into a cheaper defender i did turn lets see meil smith row has turned into morgan rogers another way for me to save 05m trent has joined my team brandon as well however i had trent and i had celba a while back and i thought geez like that feels like a lot of money for my defense like that just it feels like a bit much especially with a couple of poor fixtures ahead for for arsenal right youre not a wealthy guy either so not a wealthy guy well especially all these some of these team value mistakes ive made the last couple weeks i think ultim i cost myself maybe like 02 so a bit dumb but but salvageable and i probably i have probably gotten a couple of price rises for my transfers as well so its the question is do i feel like i need to have two like incredibly expensive defenders and i feel like maybe i can get away with it for now the key player here the way i see it josh is bay saka and you indicated that you now you you got quadruple premium if you include trenton that camp a triple premium attack between salah holland and saka some people might wonder is this the time to go without saka with a plan to get him back in gw six perhaps when there is a big fixture swing for a handful of teams saka has spurs away followed by city away spurs frankly i think is a is a is a good enough match for saka i think thats its it thats the inverse of city arsenal where you expect to be nil spurs you expect to be like 33 or thereabouts so talk to me about your logic fora now versus saka later i think thats the question is i want to have saka for that six through eight swing and do i want to put myself in a position where i have to theres not going to be a way for me to do it with one transfer right so im im almost immediately locking myself into a two transfer move to bring him back in now i dont necessarily mind that right and maybe it does make sense to go eso joda right and then turn eso into well thats a good question let me pull up the the fixture like a list of fixtures while were talking here brandon because right who would be the under the radar strikers that might just be like punt worthy for the short term is that what youre thinking so like you could go well if ali watkins pres i just think watkins is a little tricky now with their first european its not its not the hardest match right this champions league match but still it gives me a little bit of pause like another early sub coming in its like a dream run for oly to go from finish in the top four last season with billa to go to the euros scored the career defining goal to now youre in the champions league hes not going to want to miss that opportunity so he can play 90 against everton and wolves on the other hand these are the two currently the two best home fixtures back toback for villa everton wolves the in the calendar it switch away in six as well right so its its a nice its a nice trio fixtures lets see newcastle have wolves away fulam away man city at home so two pretty good fixtures better than better than arsenals fixtures over the next two right and then they do have man city at home so its easy its there are times when you almost want to lock yourself in to transfers right like you its like you almost want to force yourself to like its almost ideal to have a match like man city at home in game week six right like theres no i dont want to have eso for that im not auto autopay bill online its like this money is coming out of my account on this date and now i dont have to touch it because i am a believer that like fixtures are key right like its its like even the best players will struggle in difficult fix maybe like maybe like the absolute top peak right like maybe when like with the holland solot types theres a there maybe there like you there are some players who are so exceptional that like it doesnt matter what the fixtures are but those can be counted on one hand right like and i but i think in general even the best players are going to do amazing like fairly consistently rounded out over the course of a year theyre going to do amazing in good fixtures and theyre going to struggle at least comparatively in tough fixtures right and so the question is he is saka one of those players whos fixture proof right in terms of just hes going to be able to deliver no matter who hes playing and and i think thats thats the question for me thats the question i have to answer right and so so and if i went joda so they have forest and bournemouth at home i think again its like its such a work in progress for me right now what i want to do with my squad because when we potted last week i think i like the version of my squad i had when we did the last pod more than i like this version well i i just i feel like maybe i think that calmer that cole palmer is a little bit more fixture proof im a little spooked by the flag right and i just want to make sure theres nothing there and so i dont necessar want to have my bus team i had a more balanced squad that i was tinkering with earlier today too and that was a squad but i just think like theres it worries me to put together a squad especially a wild card squad that doesnt have like elite highend talent right its like it just feels like youre you want those players long term right and so you dont necessarily want to like get yourself in a mode where and everybody wants to do this on a wild card right you do a wild card and you want to look at game week four and and be like okay whatever game week is has ahead of you welka right you want to be like this is an awesome team this team cant lose even though we all know that like the first week after wild card like inevitably is a bust right but like you want you want that team that just like bang like right out of right out of the gate get the top score of the weekend exactly and i think the question for me was which i think opens up and i think its fair for someone listening to ask well why did you wild card at all josh and i think the question for me is i wanted mo and and i wanted more liverpool assets and there was no way for me to get mosala without burning points and once i realized that i by doing that i was going to start rearranging my team i just thought im fine just doing this now right im fine just making a bunch of changes right now and just seems like such the obvious move for everybody who doesnt have him so its to use the wild card chip instead of spending four points seems logical enough given that the banking of five transfers if you can do its like restructuring our team should in theory we havent seen it in practice just yet because its too early should be easier than recent seasons so wild carding for the reasons that youre explaining doesnt seem bad or a poor strategy at all to me i im im tempted myself but i think well do it for content josh i will i will do what you wait a week ill do the opposite okay think just in one final not on the wild card because again i know we went into it quite a lot last week but there are a couple players that i think are easy picks for wild card one of the reasons if you dont have them its a laser wild card and i think kana and anthony robinson are both great wild card picks i think lewis dunk is an excellent wild card pick as well hes not my current squad because i cant quite afford him at the moment but i think that he is at 45 an excellent pick and they have some nice fixtures ahead as well i just think hes he its in previous seasons you havent been able to get him at this discounted price right and i think a 45m center back whos going to start every match who has a little bit of goal threat is a useful fourth defender to have in your squad right and sano is my like its its like the for me pick like he still has he still has not changed in price i dont know why im the only one who is excited about this guy like i think hes like i think hes absolutely fantastic and and then ive got e in my squad right now as well who i think is a like its a hes a by low pick right hes down to 69m hes done a lot of things well and just he scored last week and got and got was it three bonus right so hes hes hes hes off the hes off the mark already and hes been unlucky to not have more returns than that has been has been widely discussed i have a one followup question on this wild card because i think its very interesting this season where there have been some disappointing higher priced forwards namely watkins and eso is in that camp as well its either holland and jo pedro or and your and your boy chris wood of course cannot forget about chris wood hes been great so the reason i bring it up is most people wild carding now will be wild carding probably into a 352 formation and its interesting to me like to wildcard all of the best players and somehow how that just like funnels you to a 352 and do you have you thought at all about what the for what formation comes results from this wild card at the moment it would be a 352 353 rotation right like if i went with the wild card that you and i are discussing right now which i am like already like im leaking confidence in my wild card i felt much more confident last week when you and i were talking and now i think its i think its the soaker thing i think you honestly this is why its useful there are times when i hate sharing my wild card team on our discord or or on twitter because i dont want i dont want to defend my picks especially because i theres a theres a style of like of like responding to someones team that i just find very grading which is always like itll be like youll share their team theyll be like no soand so question mark and thats the whole comment right and its just i find it so grayy for some reason and but i think theres you remind me of this new yorker cartoon that i love its a father whos putting his arm around his young son and hes giving him some playground life advice and he says son if you cant say anything nice say something clever but devastating right exactly theres always that type of comment its just like wow exactly what to say about my wild card team to make me doubt everything exactly and it can be a house of cards putting these squads together right you move one you like if i take sak out right that free up three million that im im its going be very hard for me not to reinvest everywhere and again and the reason that i want saka long term is because its just a tricky its very tricky to handle arsenal assets correctly i think right now because they have a tough gw four and gw five right north and derby and four man city away in game week five then they have a spectacular run from gameweeks 6 to8 lets see if i can take a quick look at it here its lester at home southampton at home bournemouth away right amazing run but then in game weeks nine and 10 they have liverpool and newcastle away in game week 10 so tough fixtures and then you factor in a bunch of european champions league matches for them as well and it suddenly does not seem hugely appealing to have assets now once thats over once theyve gone through the gauntlet of tough fixtures their run from a game week 11 out is amazing and i think that if you have not wild carded yet i think and youre gonna try to get by with like one arsenal asset one or two i do think wild carding to get your ideal arsenal 3 between game weeks 10 and 11 does make a lot of sense i think that would be one route thats thats thats out there so i think thats thats honestly where im leaning right now knockwood so nothing devastating happens to my squad but i want to probably move saka to sala for free once the game week four deadline passes and then try to try to work out through free transfers that fixture shift in game w six and the wild card around that time so thats thats the road im walking yep and i think that i think that makes a lot of sense so so thats thats my squad more to come well well talk more on the patreon pod on thursday as

excellent and one last shout out for the new always cheating substack as well we got lots of new followers after shout out last week so those are postgame week thoughts brandon the monday sus tuesday im trying to do them after all of the matches have been completed for the week so but quick thoughts on the matches so you can go to i think its always cheating substack docomo lets get into gw four though we have what i like to call a fpl classic i love a i love an a classic premier league weekend brandon where you just have matches on saturday this is a true a true classic in the way brandon because you have just you have eight matches on saturday followed by two on sunday just two matches on sunday is it is it is it beyond a classic now because there is a late kickoff on saturday super classic i like its of like class its like a rum and coke what weve got going on this weekend i like the late match by the way its its a fun one because in america this means you could do nothing all day but watch the watch the premier league right dont mind if i do dont mind if i do exactly in theory its with the with the 1230 start in england you could get up and do something with you take your kids to i dont know basketball practice and its like the nfl here on sundays right you can do you can do a bunch go to church brandon i know you love to get in a couple church sessions in the mornings if you can so just bang them out whenever possible my reps in get your reps in but but now 730 10 am 1230 and whats whats what window am i g to skip maybe villa everton thats although even that has some pretty big fantasy got back your boy morgan rogers ive got a sneaking suspicion hes gonna make the cut going what it is unfortunately its the its the southampton its the early match on sat saturday southampton hosty man united i think thats the one that i will sadly be sk just nobodys going to have players in that match i know i know some will still have well i think like the statistically inclined may still have bruno right hes still doing quite well on the stat tables and stuff but and it is a great its a great match for in theory and he did score today i dont know maybe theres something there the content gods cannot help themselves with man utd i predict a 21 southampton victory here it does feel like it might be southamptons first win of the season im im inclined to agree it feels like the momentum to get ten out of there its all here like theres united star players coming back from an international break whats going on y do they even receive any coaching wisdom from ten hog at this point i dont know i dont know either i dont know whats like i dont know what hes doing anymore i dont know why i its like all the ownership stuff has to get resolved you the detroit pistons went through this a few years ago when their owner died and there was like this big ownership takeover it was like nothing happened for like five years because it was just like the everything that was happening with the ownership just took precedence right and theres no real steward stewardship yes of things so but i think the big question we have a couple of questions about about the game week and i think the big one is from tberry and he says captain holland or salah they both have good fixtures do we go with the norwegian legion or the egyptian magician are these are those real nicknames i egptian lets see real liverpool die hards would probably not relinquish the magician from coutinho who bore that moniker for some time thats right but listen were not here to be pedantic we hate that stuff i know cheting so if you want to call him the magician go with go with it go with it you doing do another religious reference you wanted to say go with go i think okay the question is there a a like s almost stuttered up with my words there brandon is there a statistical like thing that you could like like are there statistical things that you would look at to make this decision or does it come down to feel right youve got man city hosting brenford you have liverpool hosting forest brenford and forest are both sorry just a finished the set brenford and forest are both quality midtable clubs well coached have a little bit of talent defenses are fine right like not great but not terrible again you could look at data points were three weeks into the season like whats im not sure that there are like hugely telling points of data at this point to tell you whether like one squad is whether one defense is considerably worse than the other right or whether its reliable enough information so so what do you think like just a i think its less statistical and more personnel based for me and that takes me more to holland because i think forest have been able to play im just thinking of the fullbacks honestly the wide play forest have been able to play with i think theres still betting in some new signings but i like that wide defense a bit more and it feels more stable and brenford it still makeshift with the injury to rico henry and the entire back line and we just dont rate flecken super highly i it just the personnel that city are going up against defensively augers for a holland captaincy in my mind i in general im just im gna default to holland in any scenario because i just feel like he is i do think the man city are the best team in the premier league maybe arsenal will maybe arsenal will be someday but how about how about arsenal beat them in the premier league one year before we call them the best team right like i so they just dropped points at home to brighton like i dont know why like lets lets like theres no arsenal are in a better position as the underdog anyway right they dont need anyone calling them the best team at this point so i think the man city are the best team and they have designed i feel i say this every podcast but it is important to punch home all the time which is that the best team in the premier league has designed an attack to create chances for this giant of a man this this unusually tall unusually fast unusually accurate forward right who has everything that you want and they have a pretty easy champions relatively easy champion match at midweek as well theres just no reason in my opinion to and i the argument for salah if i were to make one would be certainly you can make one is that there is he its its more likely that hes going to get assist right so theres more like it could be that the absolute top highend return for mosala is somewhere in the 20s whereas maybe for holland its more like two or three goals right and so maybe its closer like maybe his upper range is 13 to 17 points and hollands upper range is 12 to 23 i whatever like somewhere its like a little higher but i think that its so strange to me that is strange to the right word holland has scored seven goals through three ma three match weeks sal has scored three hes got three goals and three assists holland has to score hattricks to keep up with sals just rate of general xgi not xgi but just gi his gi tracked is what im following im following them more closely than the flights brandon i want to make sure that hes doing well eating well absolutely yur an ostomy bag if keep producing at this r we have a great we have a theres a couple of great yogurt companies here in the united states and so ive been sending him fj and whats the other one theres another one thats up chani ch hes getting a lot of lot of chabani too and and then im im from iceland im sending over the siggies as well so hes got a i dont think its gilfy curson company i hope theres no connection theres a lot of people with very similar names in iceland right so so what is more sustainable the way salah is getting these goals and assists or holland getting hat tricks every match week now theyre both exactly as sustainable its like right and its not that holland has is getting hattricks he has scored in every match this premier league season so i would just think of it i would boil it down to more essential parts and that holland and salah are both returning every game we and that doesnt have to be a little more complex than that i think the point for salah is that he apparently has more routes to fantasy points because he does as you were saying have assists in his quiver and thats thats good so longterm its solo looks like he might be winning out by gw 38 over holland i do think that theres i think that there are there are going to be weeks when theres a better case for salah right i think gw five i think is an example of that right in gw five youre going to have man city and arsenal play each other and despite the slander that i just directed towards arsenal a minute ago i think thats going to be a extreme difficult match in game week five even with man city at home and that same week liverpool host bournemouth so that week its an easy decision right theres right i think its because i rate forest and brenford to a certain degree i would say that i rate do i rate forest defense their defense is okay i dont know i do i rate either teams defense not i think that both teams and well i think the real question is i think both teams have enough attacking potential that they will maybe keep the other team like theyre not going to like i dont think either team is going to play seven defenders in the box what or what theyre not gonna like just absolutely park the bus and try i dont know burnford in particular have shown an ability to go to tricky away matches and get returns from them and so i think that i think that they could they could do something and even forest have like a little bit of theres some real talent in that for a squad too right so i think they could they could give you both teams could give the other one a run well thats it like whats the game state going to be through much of these fixtures is maybe another way to think about it game state city brenford is city are going to be in have like 100 possession and brenford will occasionally counterattack and i think liverpool forest honestly probably the same the same i think brenford have a of scoring in that match i would give them a pretty good shot at that but all right so thats i think its i think its tricky i think weve made i think both of us are just realistically on holland and thats just how its going to be if you had salo would you consider it more strongly do you think or you i feel like youd still be on hollands even if you it would be tempting i think i would just because thats assuming im me and i have captained holland the last three game weeks and ive captained two hattricks i feel good about that if i had hadnt had if i had captain salah the last couple of game weeks im probably just like going with whats working for my team if that makes sense all right heres another question from crim trent crim i think brandon from the independent he says is it crazy to double up on jota and louise with a free transfer before transitioning to salah on a wild card this is one of those very specific team questions that i dont havet put on the podcast but i think it is i think it does get to something that i think is interesting which is is does a joda and louise double up equal one mosala or can it like can it do in a pinch right its not easy for everybody to get to mosala unfortunately right guess the problem with this tactic is always like weve seen with jot versus diaz is ones going to score and the other is gonna blank so who are you giving up to have both of these guys so if youre giving up like one of these unreliable smith bro bruno types or whatever right its youre probably im fine with it sure it sounds cool i think the general gist of liverpool is theyre playing incredibly well they have faith in this new manager everyones informed so everyones a buy all right well what about what about your squad going into game week four what are you the plan right now is to hold your transfer can i can i see can i see what your i want to see with my own eyes what your kelly squad looks like im gonna throw it up on the youtube and ill talk everybody through what were looking at on the podcast here so there you go were at the homepage thats great its great so ive got dean henderson and go finally palace have a defense a decent defensive fixture lester at home so looking forward to that vy hatrick score anthony robinson home west ham easy celba spurs away dont love it but ill start him anyway its its like do you start celba or pedoro do you start both no im not starting both i a classic just go with the better team and i like spurs to score but i do think arsenal are the better team and well have the better of it so we just go with that logic and then cona at home with another great fixture with everton across the midfield anthony gordon away wolves i think anthony gordon finally scored an away goal a couple of game weeks ago so now hes very playable i dont i was wondering if that was like if somebody was like if you were in a position where you were planning to wild card in gw five then i think youd be in a position where the question that we just had would have at least a like i think it would be a reasonable move right going gordon to like ds in your case right i dont think that would be like that to me would be like plus ev like theres some expected value in that move for sure i think i like it potentially i think the way the non wild card for me and the low quantity of liverpool players im it works well for me if somehow forest are able to mute liverpool and newcastle have an explosive match because i think people are getting away from gordon and esok and if gordon and esak create points then great i have gotten to salah without by escaping damage there and thats what im hoping for my the big question i have with my squad is ive got jaia pedro esak and holland across the front i have benched more morgan rogers who do i drop to bring morgan rogers in smith row if i look at my team smith r feels like the one least likely to has the lowest ceiling perhaps than all of these guys jia pedro we have discussed his travel coming back from south america how many minutes can we expect from him then then theres morgan rogers who hasnt even produced any fantasy points so how does he get into this starting 11 just based on itest alone so right now ive got rogers on the bench as well as pedro poro and vace so i dont know what do you thinko bench makes sense its an interesting one celba versus poro as a as a debate i think i think i would i think i would start s over porro as well right but porro clearly had has the attacking assets that cba does not so you just go with the attacking defender but i i think i would no but i think i would still go as sleep because i think that arsenal have a better chance of keeping a clean sheet in that match and i think i do think that theres a pretty good chance that the spurs scor but i dont see them scoring multiple goals right so then its like youve got to drop a scenario where they score one goal and that goal has a poor return attached to it right so i and it feels very like that arsenal are going to score a couple in this match right so its so anyway i think youve got that one right i think i would probably start smith row over rogers as well and im with you even though i have i was debating smith row and rogers on my own wild card and i went with rogers thats mostly because of the price right its a 045m savings there and i just think that theyre close enough and i and the hope that he eventually starts returning but but we havent seen it yet and they have the the champions league is there any chance that rogers starts to get some rests ahead of some of these champions league matches i dont know right because i i dont think that emory is just gonna not try in the premier league because hes so focused in the champions league i dont i dont think thats what anybody wants or expects right so so i think its pretty close i think and i also think when stuff like this is close enough its its like you should probably dont need to sweat it too much right because its just like its hard to say whos better between the two of them this is where i know i know youre not like you dont do this they have these sports books in canada brandon you can pull one up and see whos got the better score assist prop right and those are all algorithmically driven right so its like take a look and see what what vegas thinks or whatever right and and maybe thats how you make your sure im not im not about that at all for sure so its i think its a tricky week for benching and well well be accumulating press presser knowledge as we get closer to the weekend do we get anything from the managers on players comment back etc but this is where im at i dont know how i ended up with this vice captaincy on jiao pedro that was before his brazil call up you got to go joda there right all right well make a live vice captains pick here right on the pond and well save our team right there beautiful always set your bus team everybody you never know when disaster could strike to quickly go back to the question about the double up if youre if youre wild carding next week i think that i would probably lean towards e if i if i wanted a oneweek punt on a on a on a player like if i was playy the wild card in five no matter what i think that it i think he scored the goal he got in for england which i think is probably a confidence booster for him and they play lester at home i think that its hes been taking so many shots it just feels like hes right for like a big match i me i just got double digit returns in game make three so its i like that my general preference is to diversify and not double up so im im with you on that one too all right well lets lets wrap things up here a little early this week but this is this is the second pod of the international break its were we need new brandon we need new news so lets say if you could only pick lets say youre busy this week brandon maybe youre traveling for your kids have have some i dont know rugby practice this weekend brandon you gota you gotta you got to go to a rugger tournament all right its goingon to take up your whole weekend you can record one game and watch it saturday evening on your ipad in your hotel room whats the one match that youre going to watch this weekend whats the best whats the most fun match not necess the fpl match but the most fun i do think it could fulham west ham i theres something about how this west ham team is taking shape where theyre just like a real wild card just like an unexpected team a weird team and fulham have they feel like theyve had a good transfer window but i dont think they have coalesced and are as unified a team as we saw with fulham last season so i think this could be a real shootout at the cottage and i think that this fm team is fun its theyre theyre in transition right now and its interesting i think that theyre fun to watch to if i were to pick one match to watch this week it would probably be the liverpool forest match i think well of well we have the north lon derby on sunday i was looking at the saturday pictures but thats like almost too easy right if youre watch the north london der i think that north london derage is gonna be great absolutely i think thatll be great too but just looking at the saturday fixtures again im i was like i went so far with my metaphor that i was env visioning the per like i had an image in my head of this 47y old mother of three brandon whos listening to the podcast right now and this is this is her one chance to break away right and shes going to she got the bluetooth headphones plugg into the ipad exactly kids are in the other bed raising a ruckus and shes gonna get a awayer watching metro so but im im curious i want to see what i want to see if liverpool can keep this thing going right i want to see if they its fascinating to me with the new manager and whether they can keep it up and whether salah can keep delivering and theyre just its its a its a fun version of the squad its more fun honestly than i was expecting the post clop era to be i thought thered be more of an adjustment now of course may not last but at the moment i think its fun and i do think this forest team has shown some some spark too i dont grit even some grit and like i dont i just it seems like theyre i dont think theyre i dont even think theyre quite good enough to necessarily like challenge for a european conference league spider like that but i think that theyre the squad that have enough talent like i think morgan gibbs white in particular i think is good and been fun to watch and so they its like its not your classic good team versus bad team match i think that for could give them some trouble so and then of course sunday we have the north l derby i think those are i find those matches very hard to predict in general right i think a lot of results are on the table if i were to go with like a boring pick be something like 21 arsenal ill go 32 arsenal 32 arsenal somewhere in that range both teams scoring i could see either team winning but i think arsenal probably have a little more theyre a little more organized right now like a little more stable up front it feels like they are more likely to score two goals in the match so thats your thats your pod for this week well be back on thursday with our patreon pod well be talking through wild cards maybe brandon will have been vin to drop anth taylor like not anthony no whats his name anthony taylor anthony taylor exactly anthony gordon thank you anthony gordon like a bad habit well

29,alwayscheating,fN024gTrgZ0,Josh&#39;s Wildcard Update &amp; Our GW4 FPL Preview,2024-09-09T03:05:50Z,hi and welcome to Ikea how can I help oh my schedule is crazy I just want some me time maybe it's time to embrace the joy of staying in with comfortable beds pillow and Decor mood lighting and so much more you can turn your bedroom into the place to be oh sounds like a dream we've got you visit us in store or at ikea-usa.com sleep to create your dream bedroom today [Music] [Applause] hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is Josh I'm here with Brandon Brandon how are you great what this is like a mini feeling I'm having of coming back from a summer break International has just kind of been the the drums here so I'm excited to get back to where we left off like this is a cliffhanger resolution you triggered your wild card on last week's pod and we need to know what changed where your strategies at and also what's been going on with these national team matches I mean the the whole country of Ireland has gone into hiding after Declan rice and Jack relish did did some Dirty Deeds to I'm so Comm commiserations to the Irish for sure um but how are how are you feeling I guess Vibe check Josh well The Vibes The Vibes are good I mean I feel like I really uh kind of checked out for a few now last week um when we did our you should go back and listen to last week's pod if you haven't listened to it yet because I think it's a sort of Evergreen pod um we talked about um sort of big picture takes on all 20 Premier League clubs uh covered a lot there and then I sort of revealed I hadn't told you this before the that I had activated my wild card and so we we went through that of course I've changed a lot since then I feel like it's still very much in flux and I actually kind of screwed up because they made the classic wild card problem of you ever tinkered on a wild card and you took a player out as part of a tinker and then you confirmed and then you realized that player had gone up 0.1 without realizing it happened with money okay Chris Wood so you lost whatever money you made on him were you ever going to has he increased in price since you did that he went a point won and so he's he's back in the squad I'll I'll I'll share the updated updated team with you it did actually force a kind of this is the problem is you know point one is so crucial when it comes to Wild Card decisions right there's a kind of cascading effect here so yeah I think it's been a very um yeah the Premier League I I you know this first International break is is a toughy I feel like right because you have there's a lot going on in the sports calendar like the Premier League sort of needs to compete in that world right you had the Wimbledon or I mean not Wimbledon you had the US Open final M uh college football some people would have watched the Woody Allen film Wimbledon perhaps with no Premier League on sure yeah uh is that what it's called is it no it's like match point or something right there is a movie called Wimbledon with Kristen Dunst and Paul betney yes that's the one I'm thinking up yeah there's also Challengers which I saw twice in the theater that's how much I love Challengers that's I watched it on my TV and it was it was fine I think a lot of rules were broken in that last point but we could save that for another time we'll never know we never saw what happened after you know after after the leap the big leap at the end um all right well let's yeah so International break I would say in general when it comes to how I assess the international break is I don't really pay too much attention to um returns right I mean maybe if if there was like a super out of form player who um starts to play really well um then that might change things a little bit perhaps has scored a yeah a brace for for Sweden so yeah and it's like do we should that matter I don't really know right I mean it's like it's it's nice I guess we're looking for any clues we're in like hyper this is the this is the beginning of the season it's the beginning of the detective movie everyone's a suspect and we've got to look under every Rock here ABS absolutely and and yeah turn every page right you know it's the old uh Robert Caro um Robert gly whatever author and editor yeah yeah speaking of good good films the the documentary uh with them is pretty good um so yeah I think um you know Trent had a man of the match match performance uh was it yesterday for England and uh uh let's see what else Bruno scored today but again these the I just don't think these are super relevant Bruno was you know Bruno has been playing fine I mean he just hasn't been getting any any like actual FPL returns right so um so it's like doesn't really matter what he does in the oral stage I don't really know you know kind of the same with with um with Newcastle like I'm not you know has ESO scored in gameweek three too so it's like does it really change how I feel but I'm not exactly right I'm still kind of looking more like at fixtures I would say with with Newcastle um I guess the biggest piece of news was Joe Pedro getting called up for Brazil right as an injury replacement uh Brazil um plays their final I think it is it is just friendly yeah it's Wednesday but I can't remember if there's like proper Stakes for that match or not I'm not actually sure that J Pedro would be expected to start that one anyway but he's certainly he's traveling for it right I I've got the foot mob open and uh there's there's no real indication that it is uh a match with Stakes we we'll we'll get back to you all on that one yeah this is something that I have like recently i' I've sort of like become a world cup Europa League like like a cup person where it's like if there's like a proper cup I'm going to watch it I'm all in but just like random friendlies that's a pretty high bar for me these these days like it's got to be a really like are you watching lots of friendlies like the even the England or like the American one until PCH is there like what am I watching for you know like what am I uh it is it is just just to interject just so we're putting out the right information it is a World Cup qualifier for common ball and it's Tuesday evening that Brazil plays Paraguay got it so you had the day and the stakes completely wrong so yeah but we we fixed it we fixed it that's true we got that did I I did make a point of watching the US Canada match on Saturday mostly just be I hate watched because Jesse Marsh has just what a fall from grace since he left Leeds he's just been unable to find a home he took he took Canada to the the semifinals of the Copa America as good as it's going to get for that for that guy I can tell you I can tell you this uh are you we're just not aligned anymore you know it's whether it's the movie Challengers or Jesse Marsh's career you know there are there are always interesting threads for sure I mean going back to you know the opening of of Ireland hosting England that's always just kind of a contentious rivalry and then you've got the you know sort of the expats and and Jack and Dean uh doing the business there's always kind of something interesting and I I'll watch I'm I'm just like a sicko I'll just watch it watching any soccer match right no and I I I respect that I I just there something the you the Nations League stuff was like some kind of like sea change moment for me where I was like now they're going to try to turn like friendlies into like a cup you know and it just I was like I can't this is like they have gone down a road I can't follow you know it's um so you go down that road and you tell me what the view looks like and I'll um report back it's the same view I I'll tell you that it's the same view nothing has changed uh all right so anyway we there was a Johnny fleets asked if uh uh the if the you know what what is the tail number of Ja ped return flight and will be monitor monitoring and live tweeting its progress it's like one of those coaching searches you know where like you're looking for private jets and things like that you know like um I I to me now that I know that that matches on Tuesday I would say I'm not especially concerned about Je Pedro um ahead of I mean it's not you know if they played on Friday maybe that would be one thing but I mean it's you know they play on Saturday I mean he's a it's not like he's going to rack up 180 minutes for for Brazil right and I I think it's fine I mean you know he he'll have a a late Tuesday or early Wednesday flight right I mean and presumably he's done the Brazil to England flight many many times in his life right so I don't really know what the like why that would be kind of devastating for him like I can see like if you're going to like Australia or something like that right if if you you're Crossing I mean they are crossing a hemisphere I don't know like I I guess I'm just not that worried about it are you worried about ja Pedro I'm not worried about it uh mostly because we have gone in on ja Pedro mostly for the ripple effect across the rest of our fantasy team he is the right price and he's actually in good form most of us bought ja Pedro for budgetary reasons not because we really need him to bang against I switch home I switch home is a terrific fixture and I would prefer to get 90 minutes from J Pedro in that fixture annoying one to miss out on yeah right yes it would be annoying nonetheless uh he has been kind of a long a a midterm let's call him buy so if we only get 30 minutes out of him against ipswitch so be it I think that's a good philosop I mean ultimately there's there's only so much control uh that we have over these things so I think it's probably the right approach uh to take there I think uh we will probably get some kind of update late this week right um either something from the press conference or something um in terms of like training ground photos and things like that right like if he if he doesn't even train with Brighton on Friday sure time to get worried right but I think otherwise you're probably fine and uh you know Eric asked if we uh overact overreact to international travel and rason um probably I mean I think it there have been times like a couple of years ago when you had this um you know kind of after Co there was a lot of chaos when it came to like qualifying matches right and um they were trying to squeeze like three fixtures into um some of these International breaks right and so you had matches that would literally end Thursday evening and then the the club would have a a match like Saturday morning or like you know like a the noon match on on Saturday um and uh and in those cases it what it was appropriate to over like to to react to that because you often the the player often either wouldn't start even play right um so I think that like there are times when when it's a real thing but um I I would say you know anything that you know most the normal International window ends on a Tuesday right like in the kind of like barring anything chaotic so usually the players are back they've got a couple days to adjust and usually it's fine and I kind of feel the same way about injuries right like you're always going to get some of these like kind of minor Premier League injuries like Cole Palmer right now is flagged um and um I like I to me those those are almost never a thing right like if a player suddenly gets a minor injury like a day before everyone's about to leave for international break that usually just means they're trying to give them extra rest yeah they would want extra rest and you're in a hard situation there where a you wouldn't want to decline an invitation to play for your country but also publicly you you can't decline so it's in everyone's best interest to make up some story that is defendable so Cole Palmer injury this is just how it's going to go I haven't seen any that actually scream out to me like oh dear this is like a real warning flag yeah all right let me ask you a question um and this will be the last International break question before we move on to fpl proper what is the point of having Harry Kane start for England this weekend why why was he starting like what like he's like a mid3 forward he is he is the most known commodity of all known Commodities I know they have a new manager but it's like isn't this a great time to give some new player like a run up front like I I don't I don't quite get that I think you underestimate the amount of power Harry Kane has in this situation you think he wants to he like he's pushing for a start there 100% he wants to keep the minutes hang on to that Talisman thing as long as he can yeah okay that's fair and I guess I'm looking at who else would have it was kind of like a kind of light on forwards now that I'm looking at the squad right like they sort of they like the subs were like e Bowen Bowen was technically his his sub so maybe they were just a little short on forwards this time around and olly Watkins I think given how few minutes he's playing for Aston Villa right now and he's not quite hit his stride I don't think he would have wanted to play those minutes necessarily it's more important for him to get ready ready for the Champions League yeah that's true uh by the way I did get tricked by a fake faio Romano uh Twitter feed earlier today uh that indicated that Marcus rashford was signing uh a deal to to go to a middle eastern Club the Photoshop was that convincing that you got tricked yeah it was like it was like Fabo like you know it was you know how it is it's like sometimes you want these things to be true right because it would be hilarious and so it's like your immediate response is like oh my God I love it and then uh and then the the more rational part of your brain takes everything like wait a second no one else is reporting on this I wonder if it's like Cameo now with fabito Romano like could we just reach out to him and PayPal him like €200 Euro and and he could post whatever news we asked him to much like you would do with Cameo that is a great thing I mean that that is how he he doesn't seem to have a job right outside of tweeting so like yeah I think he probably is available for hire right like we could you imagine if we just paid him to like to tweet about our podcast if that's possible I'm sure it is I'm sure it is all right U yeah next next next week keep an eye for Fab Rano tweeting out our latest episode we go always exactly we won't reveal how much how much we had to Fork over to make that happen uh all right so couple other quick uh news and Note updates um I thought this was kind of interesting Cole Palmer is not in Chelsea's uh European conference League Squad which um like I'm just a little surprised I don't know that he was going to get any starts for them but uh but it's I suppose it's a very good thing from an FPL perspective if you're looking at for for sure yeah that's that's like the level of certainty that every fantasy manager wants I suspect they can submit a different Squad once they move into the next stage of right I believe that's how it works yeah in January they which presumably they will right I mean they can field uh I mean Jaden Sancho's got to play somewhere right so I'm sure they'll get yeah what a lad uhhuh it's crazy right I mean you Sterling at Arsenal Jaden soncho at Chelsea it's so bizarre yeah it really is um yeah I mean I will see if Chelsea can even get to the next phase of that competition who knows what what version of Chelsea shows up week to week yeah absolutely but I thought that was a that was probably ultimately good news for Chelsea they don't need him um get mixed mixed up in that um so uh and then yeah might he's flagged at on the site right now but I I think it's a fairly I I I just you know I did a little bit of searching right I didn't see any real reporting on him uh having any kind of like serious issues so he should be fine yeah B dinary reports groin SL hiip pelvic injury so it's all kind of in that bathing suit area for Mr yeah uh couple other updates Jared branway uh set to return to full training this week now this I at first glance you're like why is this even relevant at all but there are a number of Defenders that are shockingly cheap for Everton and if they're able to eventually turn it around uh a lot of people will be looking at some of these players on on their wild cards and uh even for myself I'm sort of I you know I I have Michael Linko in my team right now and he's not like I'm not planning to start him but um 4.4 he's 4.4 exactly you know you have Michael Keane at 4 million too although now I'm scared to have him with with BR R set I think yeah he's must be immediately out once uh bran Way is back uh interesting I I like that I mean certainly uh can it go on forever what you saw from Everton toward the middle and definitely by the end of the season was a team that their table position was betrayed by the points deduction that the club had to take the d had them you know doing what he wanted and playing playing well decently enough and and specifically defensively and a lot of that was to do with how well branway was playing so yeah I I agree I think coming back is an interesting fantasy wrinkle yeah and I you know I don't really know um um how long it might I mean you know it's like he's just returning to training but he's been out for months so I don't know how long it'll take before he's back in in the squad but I just I you know I feel like it sounds like d is not like I think he's got a ways to go before he actually gets sacked right I think he's going to be safe for a little while so um and so I think um I don't know I just I just kind of assume still like and despite what we've seen so far that he's going to figure out how to turn this thing around maybe I'm like the last person who still thinks that but I don't disagree with you at all and yeah I think Everton have bigger issues to solve than D yeah exactly their issue is that they can't spend any money without like without getting more points deducted and so they're kind of stuck with with what they've got right um the one final news and note update I like this little maybe we start doing news and notes at the top and it's very handy I think to to go through the the news of the day it's like I've got a got a little newspaper feel like I'm watching Morning Joe right now yeah yeah exactly I remember James um Richardson used to do this AC Jimbo like he'd do these like what's in the paper remember that he Italian 90 well that well that but also I feel like it was like maybe it was like for one of the World Cups or something he had like a big stack of newspapers videos back when he did the guardian football podcast yeah exactly uh final piece of news is that European matches kickoff this week uh it has been very hard to follow what's going on cuz they literally they like just announced the fixtures a few days ago it must be like crazy booking these flights too right now that everything's announced like a week in advance and I guess they're mostly private jets but you still got to reserve a you know a like a Runway at the airport and stuff right fans the fans too you want the fans fans the fans are irrelevant right like they no one cares about them at all sure the the the beer sales in The Concourse is is is is just a grain of sand compared to all the broadcast rights everything yeah exactly they're like you you'll just do whatever we tell you to do and you know so uh but there are so first things there are no Europa or conference league matches until late September which um I somehow didn't realize until earlier today that there it's it's like a lean in on the Champions League itself until uh for the first couple weeks and so uh Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday we have Champions League matches and for all of my sort of like this is so wacky um the way that they're doing it this year it is fun to see all these matches like uh Villa play at young boys uh my favorite one one of my favorite team names and one of my favorite stadium names Brandon because it's it's the wankdorf stadium and so young I love that young boys play at the wankdorf um so that's where will be on Tuesday uh and then uh Liverpool also will play on Tuesday in the Champions League uh they uh travel to AC so uh another really interesting match uh Wednesday Man City who always have a great every year now in the Champions like they have this amazing um amazing like easy run they host Lil on Wednesday so that' be a great chance to play the play their squad players and uh and then third you know like I maybe they'll I'm sure Holland will start that match but uh and then Thursday um Arsenal uh go uh to Italy and they they'll play um Atlanta and I think that that's kind of a dangerous match for Arsenal possible banana peel type match for sure yeah and that's not it I mean we're going to be in a football coma uh By the time gameweek four gets here because efl cup is also on Tuesday and Wednesday Everton host Southampton wow brenford play Leighton Orient Fulham away Preston Palace away QPR Manchester United host barnesley on Wednesday Spurs are away Coventry oh my God Brighton host wolves Madness good well I'm glad I I I I checked out for a few days just so I can check back in um so yeah because I I front-loaded my International break I spent a lot of time on Sunday and Monday doing um Wild Card related stuff and I been sort of um and then I I tuned out for a few days I I had my fantasy NFL draft to do um with our the there's an always cheating uh fantasy NFL league uh that our friend of the Pod Dave started and so I had to do I basically did a crash course 48 Hours of drafting uh and then as I was telling you only need to draft a guy who's out for the first eight weeks of the Season early on so that was like Arsenal's trans policy yeah yeah exactly I brought in Kim cstom uh followed by who was the newest guy they brought was it Marino or whoever Marino yeah yeah um I have a question for you so we're podcasting during the LA Rams Lions game Matthew Stafford plays for the Rams one Super Bowl with him former Lions quarterback yep will Matt Stafford refuse to celebrate a touchdown if he scores one uh at line Stadium how does that work in the NFL I think no it's not like that it's a good question but no he'll he'll celebrate maybe like the first time you know they played there but it's been a couple years now I think I think he's I think they're they're over it like the Lions actually beat them in the playoffs last year he's free to dunk the football over the goal poost if he so chooses absolutely I think everyone should be allowed to celebrate this idea that you can't celebrate with your you know I think it was I think it was like the Football Ramble or something they used to have a thing who was the there was a player who I can't think of his name is an Irish forward uh but he played for like a ton of different clubs and that was like the joke is that he couldn't celebrate he couldn't celebrate any of his goals because every Club is a place he'd been at you know before um so all right so that's your news and notes section Brandon um let's do a quick look at uh my wild card here and um I'll I'll read off the team so if you're if you're watching on um you're watching on YouTube you can you can do a quick um look at our the shared screen but uh if you're listening to pod uh which is still the the vast majority of people uh we still we'll talk through um all of my picks here but um so the question for me is basically um what do I wanted okay actually two questions that there that are interrelated right and they are what do I want to do uh in terms of having like really expensive midfielders right like how like do I want to have one two um probably not three right probably impossible um uh do I want to have Holland and solid right and so until you resolve that question you almost can't put a team together right and so I had a team that I put together for last week's pot I had Cole Palmer in it I sort of talked myself out of Palmer again uh because I want um a little more balance in the squad he's just a little tricky at 10.6 below and behold here I am again I brought in another expensive player uh and I have um Bayo Saka uh who was who was replaced uh Cole Palmer uh he is 0.5 million cheaper so there is a um you know certain benefit there uh but I'll just I'm going to read through my I'm going to start with the Midfield first you know sometimes people do these the these discussions Brandon you usually work back to front but but the problem is you the meat of the sandwich yeah you exactly you frontload it with the worst part it's like if you were uh you know it's like if you were talking about an amazing sand like you said amazing sandwich and you started you know talking about the the bread I mean as the bread is the best part of the sure yeah but no one's like oh so this was the this was the style of Toothpick that they used to hold the sandwich together nobody cares what was the sandwich okay so I go through the Midfield I have I have a couple of questions after you're after you're done there so right now I've got uh Saka SEO e Salah Rogers as my as my Midfield five then up front I've got uh Holland Pedro and wood right so who's missing from this uh who's missing is a Liverpool player um a better forward up front right an esac type player um I could turn Saka into um uh into Joda and use that money to turn wood into um ESO that would that would that's one option um I could uh probably find the money to turn Saka into Palmer although again 10.1 to 10.6 doesn't seem like that much it's quite a lot right it becomes very hard to you basically go from having four or five like basically having four Defenders that you can rotate to having three right it's like you basically end up having to to move into a a cheaper Defender um I did turn um uh let's see me Smith row has turned into Morgan Rogers another way for me to save 0.5 million uh Trent has joined my team Brandon as well Trent yeah uh however I had Trent and I had CBA uh a while back and I thought geez like that feels like a lot of money for my defense like that just it feels like a bit much especially with a couple of really poor fixtures ahead for um for for Arsenal right you're not a really wealthy guy either so not a wealthy guy yeah well especially after all these some of these team value mistakes I've made the last couple weeks I I think ultim I cost myself maybe like 0.2 so a bit dumb but um but salvageable and I I probably I have probably gotten a couple of price Rises for my transfers as well um so it's you know the question is basically uh do I really feel like I need to have two like incredibly expensive Defenders and I feel like maybe I can get away with it for now um the key player here the way I see it Josh is Baka and you indicated that You' now you basically you got quadruple premium if you include Trent in that camp a triple premium attack between Salah Holland and Saka some people might wonder is this the time to go without Saka with a plan to get him back in gameweek six perhaps when there is a big fixture swing for a handful of teams yeah Saka has Spurs away followed by City away Spurs frankly I think is a is a is a good enough match for Saka I think that's yeah yeah it's that's sort of the inverse of City Arsenal where you expect to be nil nil Spurs Arsenal you expect it to be like 33 uh or thereabouts so talk to me about your s Saka later yeah I think that's really the question is um I really want to have Saka for that 6 through eight swing um and do I really want to put myself in a position where I have to there's not going to be a way for me to do it with one transfer right so I'm I'm almost immediately locking myself into a two transfer move to bring him back in now I don't necessarily mind that right um and maybe it does make sense to go isach Joda right and then turn ESO into um well that's a good question let me pull up the um the fixture like a list of fixtures while we're talking here Brandon um because yeah right who would be the under the radar Strikers that might just be sort of like punt worthy for the short term is that kind of what you're thinking yeah basically yeah so like um you know I mean you could go well I mean if Ali Watkins pres you know I just think Watkins is a little tricky now with their first you know European I mean it's not it's not the hardest match right this Champions League match but still it gives me a little bit of pause like another early sub coming in yeah it's like a dream run for Oly to go from finish in the top four last season with Villa to go to the Euros scored a career defining goal to now you're in the Champions League he's not going to want to miss that opportunity yeah so he can you know play 90 against Everton and wolves on the other hand these are the two current ly the two best home fixtures back to back for Villa Everton wolves the in the calendar it switch away in in six as well right so it's it's a nice it's a really nice Trio of fixtures um yeah let's see Newcastle have Wolves Away ful away man city at home so two pretty good fixtures I mean better than uh better than Arsenal's fixtures over the next two right and then they do have Man City at home so it's kind of easy it's there are times when you almost want to lock yourself in to to transfers right like you it's like you almost want to force yourself to like like it's almost ideal to have a match like Man City at home in game week six right like there's no I don't want to have ESO for that it's like autopay autopay bill online it's like this money is coming out of my account on this date and I I don't have to touch it because I am a believer that the like fixtures really are key right like it's it's like even even the best players will struggle in difficult fix maybe like maybe like the absolute top peak right like maybe when like with the Holland solot types there's a there there maybe there like you there are some players who are so exceptional that like it doesn't really matter what the fixtures are but those can be counted on one hand right like and I but I think in general even the best players are going to do amazing you know like fairly consistently sort of round it out over the course of a year they're going to do amazing in good fixtures and they're going to struggle at least comparatively in in tough fixtures right and so the question is he yeah is Saka one of those players who's sort of fixture proof right in terms of just he's going to be able to deliver no matter who he's playing and um and I think that's that's really the question for me that's the question I kind of have to answer right um and so yeah so and if I went Joda um so they have forest and Bournemouth at home yeah I actually think again it's like it's such a work in progress for me right now what I want to do with with my squad because um when we potted last week I actually think I like the version of my squad I had when we did the last pod more than I like this version okay well I I guess I just really I feel like maybe I think that calmer that Cole Palmer is a little bit more fixture proof um I'm a little spooked by the flag right um and I just want to make sure there's nothing there um and so I don't necessar want to have my bus team I had a more kind of balanced Squad that I was tinkering with earlier today too and that was a squad um but I just think like there's it worries me to put together a squad especially a wild card Squad that doesn't have like Elite high-end Talent right it's like it just feels like you're kind of you want those players long term right and so you don't necessarily want to like get yourself in a mode where and everybody wants to do this on a wild card right you do a wild card and you want to look at game week four and um and and and be like okay whatever game week is has ahead of you up welka right you want to be like this is an awesome team this this team can't lose even though we all know that like the first week after Wild Card like inevitably is a bust right but like you want you want that team that just like like bang like right out of right out of the gate get the top score of the weekend yeah exactly and I think the question for me was really um which which I think opens up and I think it's fair for someone listening to ask well why did you wild card at all Josh you know and I think the question for me is I I really wanted Mo and um yeah and I wanted more Liverpool assets and there was no way for me to get Mo solid without burning points and once I realized that I by doing that I was going to start rearranging my team I just thought I'm fine just doing this now right I'm fine just sort of making a bunch of changes right now and Sol just seems like such the obvious move for everybody who doesn't have him yeah so you know it's to use the Wild Card chip instead of spending Four Points seems logical enough yeah uh given the you know the the banking of five transfers if you can do it it's like restructuring our team should in theory we haven't really seen it in practice just yet cuz it's too early should be easier than recent Seasons so you know wild carding for the reasons that you're explaining doesn't really seem bad or a poor strategy at all to me I yeah I'm I'm tempted myself but I think you know we'll do it for Content Josh I I will I will do what you'll wait a week I'll do the opposite okay yeah I think just just in one final note on the wild card because again I know we went into it quite a lot last week but um there are a couple players that I think are really easy picks for wild card one of the reasons if you don't have them it's a laser wild card and I think um Kana and and uh Anthony Robinson are both great Wild Card picks um I think Lewis dunk is an excellent Wild Card pick as well he's not my current Squad because I I can't quite afford him at the moment but I think that he is um at 4.5 an excellent pick and they have some really nice fixtures ahead as well um I just think he's it's in previous Seasons you haven't been able to get him at this kind of discounted price right and I think a 4.5 million Center back who's going to start every match who has a little bit of goal threat is um a really useful kind of fourth Defender to have in your squad right um yeah and and Sano is my like kind of it's it's sort of like the for me pick like he still has he still has not changed in price I don't know why I'm the only one who is excited about this guy like I think he's like I think he's absolutely fantastic and uh and then I've got e in my squad right now as well who I think is kind of a like it's a he's a byy low sort of pick right he's down to 6.9 million he's done a lot of things well and just um I mean he scored last week and got and got was it three bonus right so I mean he's he's you know he's he's off the he's off the mark already yeah and he's been unlucky to not have more returns than that has been has has been widely discussed I have a one followup question on this wild card because I think it's very interesting this season where there have been some disappointing higher priced forwards namely Watkins and ESO is kind of in that camp as well it's either Holland Holland and Pedro or and your and your boy Chris Wood of cannot forget about Chris great yeah so the reason I bring it up is most people wild carding now will be wild carding probably into a 352 formation and it's interesting to me like to Wild Card all of the best players and somehow that just like funnels you to a 352 and do you have have you thought at all about what the for what formation comes results from this this wild card yeah I mean at the moment it would be a kind of 352 353 rotation right like if I went with the wild card that you and I are discussing right now which I am sort of like already like I'm leaking confidence in my wild card I felt much more confident last week when you and I were talking and now I think it's I think it's the Saka thing I think you you know honestly this is why it's useful there are times when I hate sharing my wild card team on our Discord or um you know or on Twitter because I don't really want um I don't want to defend my picks especially because I there's a there's a a kind of style of of like of of like responding to someone's team that I just find very grading which is always like it'll be like you'll share their team and then they'll be like no soand so question mark you know that's the whole comment right uh and it's just I find it so grany for some reason and um but I think there's you remind me of this New Yorker cartoon that I love it's a father who's putting his arm around his young son and he's kind of giving him some playground life advice and he says son if you can't say anything nice say something clever but devastating right exactly exactly there's always that type of uh comment it's just like wow you know exactly what to say about my wild card team to make me doubt everything yeah exactly and and and really it it really can be a house of cards putting these these squads together right you move one you like if I take sck out right that fre Up 3 million that I'm I'm it's going be very hard for me not to reinvest everywhere and again and the reason that I want Saka long term is because it's just a really tricky it's very tricky to handle Arsenal assets correctly I think right now because they have a really tough gameweek four and gameweek five right North L Derby and four Man City away in gameweek five then they have a spectacular run from game weeks six to eight um let's see if I can take a quick look at it here it's uh yeah Lester at home Southampton at home Bournemouth away right amazing run uh but then uh in game weeks nine and 10 they have uh uh Liverpool and Newcastle Newcastle away in gameweek 10 so tough fixtures and then you factor in a bunch of European Champions League matches for them as well and it suddenly does not seem hugely appealing to have Arsenal Assets Now once that's over once they've sort of gone through the kind of Gauntlet of really tough fixtures they're run from gameweek 11 out is amazing and I think that if you have not wild carded yet I think and and you're sort of going to try to get by with like one Arsenal asset um one or two um I do think wild carding to sort of get your ideal Arsenal 3 you know between gameweeks 10 and 11 does make a lot of sense I think that would be um you know one one route that's that's that's out there so I think that's that's honestly where I'm leaning right now knockwood so nothing devastating happens to my squad but I want to probably move move Saka to Salah for free uh once the game week four deadline passes and then yeah try to try to work out through free transfers that fixture shift in game w six and the Wild Card around that time so that's that's the road I'm walking yep yeah and I think that I think that makes a lot of sense so um so that's that's my squad uh more more to come we'll we'll talk more on the patreon PO on Thursday as we get more information about some

just have matches on Saturday this is a a true a true classic in a way Brandon because you have just you have eight matches on Saturday followed by two on Sunday just two matches on Sunday is it is it is it Beyond a classic now because there is a late kickoff on Saturday oh super classic yeah I like it it's s of like class it's like a rum and coke basically what we've got going on this weekend I like the late match by the way it's it's a fun one because uh in America this this means you really could do nothing all day but watch the watch the premier league right Don't Mind If I Do Don't Mind If I Do yeah exactly in theory it's with the with the 12:30 start in England you could get up and do something with you take your kids to to to I don't know basketball practice and um it's like the NFL here on Sundays right you can do you can do a bunch go to church Brandon I know you love to get in a couple Church sessions in the mornings if you can so just bang them out you know whenever possible reps in get your reps in uh but yeah you know but now yeah 7:30 10: a.m. 12:30 and what's what's what what window am I going to skip I guess maybe Villa Everton that's although even that you know has some pretty big F got back your boy Morgan Rogers I've got a sneaking suspicion he's going to make the cut going game you know what it is unfortunately it's the it's the Southampton it's the early match on Saturday Southampton hosting man united I think that's the one that I will sadly be nobody's going to have players in this match I know I know I mean some will still have well I mean I think like the statistically inclined may still have Bruno Bruno right he's still doing quite well in the stat tables and stuff but um yeah uh and and it is a great I mean it's a great match for you know in theory and he did score today I don't know maybe there's something there the content Gods cannot help themselves with Manchester United I predict a 2-1 Southampton Victory here it does feel like it might be southampton's first win of the season I I'm I'm kind of inclined to agree it feels like the momentum to get ten out of there it's all here like there United star players coming back from an international break what's going on do they even receive any coaching wisdom from T hog at this point I don't know I I don't know either I really don't know what's uh like I don't know what he's doing anymore I don't know why he's there I I guess it's like all the ownership stuff has to get resolved you the the Detroit Pistons and went through this a few years ago when their owner died and there was like this big ownership takeover and it was like nothing happened for like five years because it was just like the everything was happening with the ownership just sort of took precedence right and there so there's no real kind of Steward stewardship yes uh of things so um but yeah I think the big question we have a couple of questions about um about the game week and I think you know the big one um is from idleb and he says Captain Holland or Salah uh they both have good fixtures do we go with the Norwegian Legion or the Egyptian magician are these are those real nicknames I Egyptian see real Liverpool die hards would probably not relinquish the magician from coutinho Who Bore that mon for some time that's right but listen we we're not here to be pedantic we actually hate that stuff I know so if you want to call him the magician go with Go With It Go with it yeah you didn't want to do another religious reference you wanted to say go with God yeah um I think um okay I guess the question is is there a uh a like s oh almost sted up with my words there Brandon is there a statistical like thing that you could like you know like are there statistical things that you would look at to make this decision or does it really come down to feel right you've got Man City hosting brenford you have Liverpool hosting Forest uh brenford and Forest are both sorry just to finish the kind of set up here brenford and Forest are both quality mid-table clubs well coached have a little bit of talent uh defenses are fine right like uh not great um but not terrible um again you could look at data points we're 3 weeks into the season like what's you know I'm not sure that there are like hugely telling points of data at this point to tell you whether like one Squad is you know whether one defense is considerably worse than the other right or whether it's reliable enough information so um yeah so what do you think like you know just a I think it's less statistical and more Personnel based for me and that that takes me more to Holland because I think Forest have been able to play I'm just thinking of the fullbacks honestly the wide play Forest have been able to play with uh I think there's still betting in some new signings but I like their wide defense a bit more and it feels more stable and brenford it still makeshift with the injury to R Henry and the entire backline and you know we just don't rate uh fleen super highly I it just the Personnel that City are going up against defensively augers for a a Holland captaincy in my mind yeah um I I I in general I'm just I'm going to default to Holland in basically any scenario because I just feel like he is um I I do think the man city are the best team in the Premier League uh you know maybe Arsenal will maybe Arsenal will be someday but how about how about Arsenal actually beat them in the Premier League one year before we called him the best team right like I you know so I mean they just dropped points at home to to Brighton like I don't know why you know like let's let's like there's no Arsenal are in a better position as the underdog anyway right they don't need um anyone calling them the best team at this point um so I think the man city are the best team and they have designed I I feel I say this every podcast but it really is important to to punch home all the time which is that the best team in the Premier League has designed an attack to create chances for this giant of a man this you know this this this kind of unusually tall usually fast unusually accurate forward right who kind of has everything that that you want and they have a pretty easy uh Champions relatively easy Champions League match at midweek as well there's just no reason in my opinion to you know and I I guess the the argument for Salah if I were to make one would be I mean certainly you can make one uh is that there is um he it's it's more likely that he's going to get assist right so there's more like it it could be that the absolute absolute top top high-end return for mosala is somewhere in the 20s whereas maybe for Holland it's more like two or three goals right and so maybe it's closer to like maybe his his upper range is 13 to 17 points and Holland's upper range is 12 to 23 I you know whatever like somewhere it's like a little higher but I think that yeah it's so strange to me that uh is strange to the right word Holland has scored seven goals through three ma three match weeks yeah Sal has scored three he's got three goals and three assists Holland has to score hattricks to keep up with salah's just yeah R of General xgi uh or not xgi but just GI his GI track is what I'm following I'm following them more closely than the flights Brandon I want to make sure that he's doing doing well eeden well absolutely he's going to need an ostomy bag if he keeps producing at this this rate we have a great we have a there's a couple of great yogurt companies here in the United States right and so I've been sending him FJ and uh what's the other one there's another one that's up chani Chobani oh he's getting a lot of lot of Chobani too and uh and then I'm actually I'm from Iceland I'm sending over the siggies as well so he's got a I don't think it's guil cigarets and Company I I hope there's no connection there there's a lot of people with very similar names in Iceland right so yeah so what what is more sustainable the way Salah is getting these goals and assists or Holland getting hat tricks every match week now they're both exactly as sustainable it's like right and it's not that Holland has is is getting hattricks he has scored in every match this Premier League season so I would just think of it I would boil it down to more essential parts and that Holland and Salah are both returning every game week and it doesn't have to be a little more complex than that I think the the point for Salah is that he apparently has more routes to fantasy points because he does as you were saying have assists in his quiver and that's that's good so longterm it's Salah looks like he might be winning out by gameweek 38 over Holland yeah uh I do think that there's I I think that there there they're going to be weeks when when there's a better case for Salah right I think uh game week five I think is an example of that right in game week five you're going to have uh Man City and Arsenal play each other and despite the slander that I just directed towards Arsenal a minute ago I think that that's going to be a extremely difficult match in game week five even with Man City at home uh and that same week Liverpool host Bournemouth so that week it's an easy decision right uh there's right I I think it's because I I I rate forest and brenford to a certain degree I would say that I rate uh H do I rate Forest defense their defense is okay I don't know I mean I do I rate either team's defense not really I think that both teams and well I think the real question is you know I think both teams have enough attacking potential that they will maybe keep the other team like they're not going to like I don't think either team is going to play seven defenders in the box or what or you know what I mean they're not going to like just absolutely park the bus and and and try I I I don't know brenford in particular have shown an ability to go to tricky away matches and and get returns you know from them and so I think that um I think that you know they could they could do something um and even Forest have like a little bit of um you know there's some real talent in that Forest Squad too right so I think that they could they could um give you know both teams could could give the other one a a run well yeah that that's it like what's the game State going to be through much of these fixtures is maybe another way to think about it yeah game state city brenford is City are going to be uh in have like 100% possession yeah again then and brenford will occasionally Counterattack and I think Liverpool Forest honestly probably the same the same I think brenford have a good chance of scoring in that match I would give them a pretty good shot at that but um all right so that's I I think it's I think it's really tricky I think we've made I think both of us are just realistically on Holland and and that's just you know how it's going to be I mean if you had Salah would you consider it more strongly do you think or you I feel like you'd still be on Hollands even if you it would be tempting um I think I would just because that's assuming I'm me and I have captained Holland the last three game weeks and I've captained two hattricks I feel good about that if I had hadn't had if I had Captain Salah the last couple of game weeks I'm probably just like going with what's working for my team if that makes sense all right here's another question from Crim Trent Crim I think Brandon from the Independent he says is it crazy to double up on jota and Louise with a free transfer before transitioning to Salah on a wild card this is one of those very specific team questions that I don't have't put in the podcast but I think it is I think it it does get to something that I think is interesting which is um is does aoda and Louise double up kind of equal one mosala or can it like can it do in a pinch right it's not not easy for everybody to get to most Sol unfortunately right yeah guess the problem with this tactic is always like we've seen with jot versus Diaz is one's going to score and the other is going to blank so who are you giving up to have both of these guys so I mean I guess I guess if you're giving up like one of these unreliable Smith Bruno types or whatever right you know it's yeah you're probably I'm fine with probably okay sure it sounds cool I I think the the the general gist of Liverpool is they're playing incredibly well they have faith in this new manager everyone's in so uh everyone's a buy all right well what about uh what about your squad going into game week four what are are you the plan right now is to hold your transfer um can I can I see can I see what your squad I want to see with my own eyes what your Kelly Squad looks like I'm gonna throw it up on the YouTube and I'll talk everybody through uh what what we're looking at on the podcast here so uh uh oh there you go we're at the the homepage it's great it's great so I've got Dean Henderson and go uh finally Palace have a defense a decent defensive fixture Lester at home so looking forward to that VY hatrick he yeah Anthony Robinson Home West Ham easy CBA Spurs away don't love it but I'll start him anyway uh it's it's sort of like do you start CBA or Pedro poro do you start both no I'm not starting both I sort of a classic just go with the better team and I I like Spurs to score but I do think Arsenal are the better team and we'll have the better of it so we just go with that logic and then cona at home with another great fixture with Everton across the Midfield Anthony Gordon away wolves I think Anthony Gordon finally scored in a away goal a couple of game weeks ago so so now he's very playable I yeah I was wondering if that was like if somebody was like if you were in a position where you were planning a wild card in gameweek five then I actually think you'd be in a position where the question that we just had would have at least a like I think it would be a reasonable move right going going Gordon to um like um DS D in your case right I don't think that would be like that to me would be like plus EV like there's some expected value in that move for sure I think I like it yeah potentially I think the way the non wild card for me and the low quantity of Liverpool players I'm it it works well for me if somehow Forest are able to mute Liverpool and Newcastle have an explosive match because I think people are getting away from Gordon and ESO and if Gordon and ESO create points then great I have gotten to Salah basically without by escaping damage there and that's really what I'm hoping for my the the big question I have with my squad is I've got Jia pager esok and Holland across the front I have benched Morgan Rogers who do I drop to bring Morgan Rogers in Smith row if I look at my team Smith row feels like the one least likely to has the lowest ceiling perhaps than all of these guys jaia Pedro we have discussed his travel coming back from South America how many minutes can we expect from him then uh then there's Morgan Rogers who hasn't even produced any fantasy points so how does he get into this starting 11 just based on itest alone so right now I've got Rogers on the bench as well as Pedro roro and Vace so I don't know what do you think of this bench makes sense um you know I mean it's actually an interesting one CBA versus poro as a as a debate I mean I think um I think I would I I think I would start CBA over poro as well um right but porro clearly has the attacking assets that CBA does not so you just go with the attacking Defender yeah but I I mean I think I would no but I think I would still go asle because I think that Arsenal have a better chance keep a clean sheet in that match and I think I do think that there's a pretty good chance that the Spurs score but I don't see them scoring m goals right so then it's like you've got to kind of drop a scenario where they score one goal and that goal has a poor return attached to it right so and and it feels very likely that Arsenal are going to score a couple in this match right so it's sort of um yeah I so anyway I think you've got that one right I think I would probably start Smith row over Rogers as well and I guess I'm sort of with you even though I have uh I was debating Smith and Rogers On My Own wild card and I went with Rogers that's mostly because of the price right it's a 04.5 million savings there and um you know I just think that um they're close enough and I and I guess the the hope is that he eventually starts returning but um but yeah we haven't seen it yet and they have the um the champions league is there any chance that Rogers starts to get some rests ahead of some of these Champions League matches I don't know right because I I you know I don't think that um Emory is just going to you know not try in the Premier League because he's so focused in the Champions League I don't I don't think that's what anybody wants or expects right so um so I think it's pretty close I think um and I also think when when stuff like this is close enough it's it's like you should probably don't need to sweat it too much right because it's just like it's really hard to say who's better between the two of them this is where I know I know you're not like you don't do this but you know they have these Sports books in Canada Brandon you can uh you know pull one up and see who's got the better to score assist prop right and um you know those are all algorithmically driven right so it's like take a look and see what you know U what Vegas thinks or whatever right and uh uh and maybe that's you know how you make your sure yeah I'm not I'm not above that at all for sure so it's I think it's a tricky week for benching and we'll we'll be accumulating press presser knowledge as we get closer to the weekend do we get anything from the managers on players comment back Etc but yeah this is where I'm at I don't know how I ended up with this Vice captaincy on Jiao Pedro that was before his Brazil call up I guess um yeah I guess you got to go Joda there right yeah all right we'll make a live Vice Captain's pick here right on the pond and we'll save our team right there beautiful always set your bus team everybody you never know when the disaster could strike to quickly go back to the question about the double up if you're if you're wild carding next week I actually think that uh I would probably lean towards e if I had if I wanted a onewe punt on a um on a on a player uh like if I basically was playing the wild card in five no matter what um I think that it you know I think he scored the goal he got in for England which I think is probably a confidence booster for him uh and they play ler at home um I think that it's he's been taking so many shots um it just feels like he's kind of right for like a really big match um I just got double digit returns in game week three so um you know it's I like that my general preference is to diversify and not double up so I'm I'm with you on that one too all right well let's let's wrap things up here um a a little early this week but this is you know this is the second pod of the international break it's we're sort of um we need news Brandon we need new news uh so let's say uh if you could only pick uh let's say you're busy this week Brandon maybe you're traveling your kids have uh have some um I don't know rugby practice this weekend Brandon you gota you gotta you got to go to a rugger tournament all right it's goingon to take up your whole weekend you can record one game and watch it Saturday evening you know on your iPad in your hotel room uh what's the one match that you're going to watch this weekend what's the best what's the most fun match not the FPL match but the most fun I do think it could be Fulham West Ham I there's something about how this West Ham team is taking shape where they're just like a real wild card just like an unexpected team a weird team yeah and fham have you know they feel like they've had a good transfer window but I don't think they have really sort of coalesced and are as unified a team as we saw with Fulham last season so I think this could be a real shootout at at the cottage yeah uh and I think that this FM team is kind of fun it's they're they're really in transition right now and it's sort of interesting um I think that they're fun to watch too I guess if I were to pick one match to watch this week it would probably be the Liverpool Forest match I think well of well obviously we have the the north Lon Derby on Sunday I guess I was sort of looking at the Saturday pict but that that's like almost too easy right obviously yeah if you're watch watch the nor Lon I think that that North London Dar is going to be great absolutely I think that'll be great too but just looking at the the Saturday fixtures again I'm I it's like I I I went so far with my metaphor that I really was envisioning the the per like I had an image in my head of this 47-year-old uh mother of three Brandon who's listening to the podcast right now and this is this is her one chance to break away right and she's going to she got the the Bluetooth headphones pluged into the iPad kids are in the other bed you know raising a Ruckus and she's going to get away for watching Metro minute so but I'm really curious I want to see what I want to see if Liverpool can keep this thing going right I want to see if they it's fascinating to me with with the new manager and whether they can keep it up and whether Salah can keep delivering and they're just it's it's a it's a fun version of the squad it's more fun honestly than I was expecting uh the post clop era to be I thought there'd be more of an adjustment um now of course you know may not last but at the moment I I think it's really fun and I I do think this for team has shown some um some spark too I don't grit even yeah some grit and like I don't you know I I just it seems like they're I don't think they're I don't even think they're really quite good enough to necessarily like challenge for a European conference League spot like that but but I think that they're the kind of squad that have enough Talent like I think you know Morgan Gibbs white in particular I think is really good and been fun to watch and so they sort of it's like it's not your classic good team versus bad team kind of match think that Forest could give them uh some trouble so uh yeah of course Sunday we have the Northland Derby I I think those are I find those matches very hard to predict in general right I think uh a lot of results are on the table um I guess if I were to go with like a really boring pick it'd be something like 21 Arsenal um but you know I'll go 32 Arsenal 32 Arsenal yeah somewhere in that range both teams scoring I could see either team winning but I think Arsenal probably have a little more kind of they're a little more organized right now like a little more kind of stable up front it feels like they are more likely to score two goals in the match um so yeah that's your that's your pod for this week we'll be back on Thursday with our patreon pod uh we'll be talking through wild cards maybe Brandon will have been convinced to drop um anth you know Taylor like not Anthony no what's his name Anthony Taylor Anthony Taylor yeah yeah exactly Anthony Gordon thank you Anthony Gordon uh like a bad habit we'll see and uh we'll see what else is going on so we'll

cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you great what this is like a mini feeling im having of coming back from a summer break international has just been the drums here so im excited to get back to where we left off like this is a cliffhanger resolution you triggered your wild card on last weeks pod and we need to know what changed where your strategies at and also whats been going on with these national team matches the whole country of ireland has gone into hiding after declan rice and jack relish did some dirty deeds to im so comm commiserations to the irish for sure but how are how are you feeling vibe check josh well the vibes the vibes are good i feel like i checked out for a few now last week when we did our you should go back and listen to last weeks pod if you havent listened to it yet because i think its a evergreen pod we talked about big picture takes on all 20 premier league clubs covered a lot there and then i revealed i hadnt told you this before the that i had activated my wild card and so we went through that of course ive changed a lot since then i feel like its still in flux and i screwed up because they made the classic wild card problem of you ever tinkered on a wild card and you took a player out as part of a tinker and then you confirmed and then you realized that player had gone up 01 without realizing it happened with money okay chris wood so you lost whatever money you made on him were you ever going to has he increased in price since you did that he went a point won and so hes hes back in the squad ill ill ill share the updated team with you it did force a this is the problem is point one is so crucial when it comes to wild card decisions right theres a cascading effect here so i think its been a very the premier league i this first international break is a toughy i feel like right because you have theres a lot going on in the sports calendar like the premier league needs to compete in that world right you had the wimbledon or not wimbledon you had the us open final m college football some people would have watched the woody allen film wimbledon perhaps with no premier league on sure is that what its called is it no its like match point right there is a movie called wimbledon with kristen dunst and paul betney yes thats the one im thinking up theres also challengers which i saw twice in the theater thats how much i love challengers thats i watched it on my tv and it was it was fine i think a lot of rules were broken in that last point but we could save that for another time well never know we never saw what happened after after the leap the big leap at the end all right well lets so international break i would say in general when it comes to how i assess the international break is i dont pay too much attention to returns right maybe if there was like a super out of form player who starts to play well then that might change things a little bit perhaps has scored a a brace for sweden so and its like do we should that matter i dont know right its like its its nice were looking for any clues were in like hyper this is the this is the beginning of the season its the beginning of the detective movie everyones a suspect and weve got to look under every rock here abs absolutely and turn every page right its the old robert caro robert gly whatever author and editor speaking of good films the documentary with them is pretty good so i think trent had a man of the match performance was it yesterday for england and lets see what else bruno scored today but again these the i just dont think these are super relevant bruno was bruno has been playing fine he just hasnt been getting any like actual fpl returns right so so its like doesnt matter what he does in the oral stage i dont know the same with with newcastle like im not has eso scored in gw three too so its like does it change how i feel but im not exactly right im still looking more like at fixtures i would say with newcastle the biggest piece of news was joe pedro getting called up for brazil right as an injury replacement brazil plays their final i think it is it is just friendly its wednesday but i cant remember if theres like proper stakes for that match or not im not sure that j pedro would be expected to start that one anyway but hes certainly hes traveling for it right ive got the foot mob open and theres theres no real indication that it is a match with stakes well well get back to you all on that one this is something that i have like recently i ive like become a world cup europa league like a cup person where its like if theres like a proper cup im going to watch it im all in but just like random friendlies thats a pretty high bar for me these days like its got to be a like are you watching lots of friendlies like the even the england or like the american one until pch is there like what am i watching for like what am i it is it is just to interject just so were putting out the right information it is a world cup qualifier for common ball and its tuesday evening that brazil plays paraguay got it so you had the day and the stakes completely wrong so but we fixed it we fixed it thats true we got that did i did make a point of watching the us canada match on saturday mostly just be i hate watched because jesse marsh has just what a fall from grace since he left leeds hes just been unable to find a home he took he took canada to the semifinals of the copa america as good as its going to get for that for that guy i can tell you i can tell you this are you were just not aligned anymore its whether its the movie challengers or jesse marshs career there are there are always interesting threads for sure going back to the opening of ireland hosting england thats always just a contentious rivalry and then youve got the the expats and jack and dean doing the business theres always something interesting and ill watch im im just like a sicko ill just watch it watching any soccer match right no and i respect that i just there something the you the nations league stuff was like some like sea change moment for me where i was like now theyre going to try to turn like friendlies into like a cup and it just i was like i cant this is like they have gone down a road i cant follow its so you go down that road and you tell me what the view looks like and ill report back its the same view ill tell you that its the same view nothing has changed all right so anyway we there was a johnny fleets asked if the if the what is the tail number of ja ped return flight and will be monitor monitoring and live tweeting its progress its like one of those coaching searches where like youre looking for private jets and things like that like i to me now that i know that matches on tuesday i would say im not especially concerned about je pedro ahead of its not if they played on friday maybe that would be one thing but its they play on saturday hes a its not like hes going to rack up 180 minutes for brazil right and i think its fine hell have a late tuesday or early wednesday flight right and presumably hes done the brazil to england flight many times in his life right so i dont know what the like why that would be devastating for him like i can see like if youre going to like australia like that right if youre crossing they are crossing a hemisphere i dont know like i im just not that worried about it are you worried about ja pedro im not worried about it mostly because we have gone in on ja pedro mostly for the ripple effect across the rest of our fantasy team he is the right price and hes in good form most of us bought ja pedro for budgetary reasons not because we need him to bang against i switch home i switch home is a terrific fixture and i would prefer to get 90 minutes from j pedro in that fixture annoying one to miss out on right yes it would be annoying nonetheless he has been a long a midterm lets call him buy so if we only get 30 minutes out of him against ipswitch so be it i think thats a good philosop ultimately theres theres only so much control that we have over these things so i think its probably the right approach to take there i think we will probably get some update late this week right either something from the press conference in terms of like training ground photos and things like that right like if he if he doesnt even train with brighton on friday sure time to get worried right but i think otherwise youre probably fine and eric asked if we overact overreact to international travel and rason probably i think it there have been times like a couple of years ago when you had this after co there was a lot of chaos when it came to like qualifying matches right and they were trying to squeeze like three fixtures into some of these international breaks right and so you had matches that would end thursday evening and then the club would have a match like saturday morning or like like a the noon match on saturday and and in those cases it what it was appropriate to over like to react to that because you often the player often either wouldnt start even play right so i think that like there are times when its a real thing but i would say anything that most the normal international window ends on a tuesday right like in the like barring anything chaotic so usually the players are back theyve got a couple days to adjust and usually its fine and i feel the same way about injuries right like youre always going to get some of these like minor premier league injuries like cole palmer right now is flagged and i like i to me those are almost never a thing right like if a player suddenly gets a minor injury like a day before everyones about to leave for international break that usually just means theyre trying to give them extra rest they would want extra rest and youre in a hard situation there where a you wouldnt want to decline an invitation to play for your country but also publicly you cant decline so its in everyones best interest to make up some story that is defendable so cole palmer injury this is just how its going to go i havent seen any that scream out to me like dear this is like a real warning flag all right let me ask you a question and this will be the last international break question before we move on to fpl proper what is the point of having harry kane start for england this weekend why was he starting like what like hes like a mid3 forward he is he is the most known commodity of all known commodities i know they have a new manager but its like isnt this a great time to give some new player like a run up front like i dont i dont quite get that i think you underestimate the amount of power harry kane has in this situation you think he wants to he like hes pushing for a start there 100 he wants to keep the minutes hang on to that talisman thing as long as he can okay thats fair and im looking at who else would have it was like a light on forwards now that im looking at the squad right like they they like the subs were like e bowen was technically his sub so maybe they were just a little short on forwards this time around and olly watkins i think given how few minutes hes playing for aston villa right now and hes not quite hit his stride i dont think he would have wanted to play those minutes necessarily its more important for him to get ready for the champions league thats true by the way i did get tricked by a fake faio romano twitter feed earlier today that indicated that marcus rashford was signing a deal to go to a middle eastern club the photoshop was that convincing that you got tricked it was like it was like fabo like it was how it is its like sometimes you want these things to be true right because it would be hilarious and so its like your immediate response is like my god i love it and then and then the more rational part of your brain takes everything like wait a second no one else is reporting on this i wonder if its like cameo now with fabito romano like could we just reach out to him and paypal him like 200 euro and he could post whatever news we asked him to much like you would do with cameo that is a great thing that is how he doesnt seem to have a job right outside of tweeting so like i think he probably is available for hire right like we could you imagine if we just paid him to like to tweet about our podcast if thats possible im sure it is im sure it is all right u next week keep an eye for fab rano tweeting out our latest episode we go always exactly we wont reveal how much how much we had to fork over to make that happen all right so couple other quick news and note updates i thought this was interesting cole palmer is not in chelseas european conference league squad which like im just a little surprised i dont know that he was going to get any starts for them but but its its a very good thing from an fpl perspective if youre looking at for sure thats thats like the level of certainty that every fantasy manager wants i suspect they can submit a different squad once they move into the next stage of right i believe thats how it works in january they which presumably they will right they can field jaden sanchos got to play somewhere right so im sure theyll get what a lad uhhuh its crazy right you sterling at arsenal jaden soncho at chelsea its so bizarre it is i will see if chelsea can even get to the next phase of that competition who knows what version of chelsea shows up week to week absolutely but i thought that was a that was probably ultimately good news for chelsea they dont need him get mixed up in that so and then might hes flagged at on the site right now but i think its a fairly i just i did a little bit of searching right i didnt see any real reporting on him having any like serious issues so he should be fine b dinary reports groin sl hiip pelvic injury so its all in that bathing suit area for mr couple other updates jared branway set to return to full training this week now this i at first glance youre like why is this even relevant at all but there are a number of defenders that are shockingly cheap for everton and if theyre able to eventually turn it around a lot of people will be looking at some of these players on their wild cards and even for myself im i i have michael linko in my team right now and hes not like im not planning to start him but 44 hes 44 exactly you have michael keane at 4m too although now im scared to have him with br r set i think hes must be immediately out once bran way is back interesting i like that certainly can it go on forever what you saw from everton toward the middle and definitely by the end of the season was a team that their table position was betrayed by the points deduction that the club had to take the d had them doing what he wanted and playing well decently enough and specifically defensively and a lot of that was to do with how well branway was playing so i agree i think coming back is an interesting fantasy wrinkle and i i dont know how long it might its like hes just returning to training but hes been out for months so i dont know how long itll take before hes back in the squad but i just i i feel like it sounds like d is not like i think hes got a ways to go before he gets sacked right i think hes going to be safe for a little while so and so i think i dont know i just i just assume still like and despite what weve seen so far that hes going to figure out how to turn this thing around maybe im like the last person who still thinks that but i dont disagree with you at all and i think everton have bigger issues to solve than d exactly their issue is that they cant spend any money without like without getting more points deducted and so theyre stuck with what theyve got right the one final news and note update i like this little maybe we start doing news and notes at the top and its very handy i think to go through the news of the day its like ive got a got a little newspaper feel like im watching morning joe right now exactly i remember james richardson used to do this ac jimbo like hed do these like whats in the paper remember that he italian 90 well that well that but also i feel like it was like maybe it was like for one of the world cups he had like a big stack of newspapers videos back when he did the guardian football podcast exactly final piece of news is that european matches kickoff this week it has been very hard to follow whats going on cuz they they like just announced the fixtures a few days ago it must be like crazy booking these flights too right now that everythings announced like a week in advance and theyre mostly private jets but you still got to reserve a a like a runway at the airport and stuff right fans the fans too you want the fans the fans are irrelevant right like they no one cares about them at all sure the beer sales in the concourse is just a grain of sand compared to all the broadcast rights everything exactly theyre like youll just do whatever we tell you to do and so but there are so first things there are no europa or conference league matches until late september which i somehow didnt realize until earlier today that there its its like a lean in on the champions league itself until for the first couple weeks and so tuesday wednesday and thursday we have champions league matches and for all of my like this is so wacky the way that theyre doing it this year it is fun to see all these matches like villa play at young boys my favorite one of my favorite team names and one of my favorite stadium names brandon because its its the wankdorf stadium and so young i love that young boys play at the wankdorf so thats where will be on tuesday and then liverpool also will play on tuesday in the champions league they travel to ac so another interesting match wednesday man city who always have a great every year now in the champions like they have this amazing amazing like easy run they host lil on wednesday so that be a great chance to play the play their squad players and and then third like i maybe theyll im sure holland will start that match but and then thursday arsenal go to italy and theyll play atlanta and i think thats a dangerous match for arsenal possible banana peel type match for sure and thats not it were going to be in a football coma by the time gw four gets here because efl cup is also on tuesday and wednesday everton host southampton wow brenford play leighton orient fulham away preston palace away qpr man utd host barnesley on wednesday spurs are away coventry my god brighton host wolves madness good well im glad i checked out for a few days just so i can check back in so because i frontloaded my international break i spent a lot of time on sunday and monday doing wild card related stuff and i been and then i tuned out for a few days i had my fantasy nfl draft to do with our the theres an always cheating fantasy nfl league that our friend of the pod dave started and so i had to do i did a crash course 48 hours of drafting and then as i was telling you only need to draft a guy whos out for the first eight weeks of the season early on so that was like arsenals trans policy exactly i brought in kim cstom followed by who was the newest guy they brought was it marino or whoever marino i have a question for you so were podcasting during the la rams lions game matthew stafford plays for the rams one super bowl with him former lions quarterback yep will matt stafford refuse to celebrate a touchdown if he scores one at line stadium how does that work in the nfl i think no its not like that its a good question but no hell hell celebrate maybe like the first time they played there but its been a couple years now i think i think hes i think theyre theyre over it like the lions beat them in the playoffs last year hes free to dunk the football over the goal poost if he so chooses absolutely i think everyone should be allowed to celebrate this idea that you cant celebrate with your i think it was i think it was like the football ramble they used to have a thing who was the there was a player who i cant think of his name is an irish forward but he played for like a ton of different clubs and that was like the joke is that he couldnt celebrate he couldnt celebrate any of his goals because every club is a place hed been at before so all right so thats your news and notes section brandon lets do a quick look at my wild card here and ill ill read off the team so if youre if youre watching on youre watching on youtube you can you can do a quick look at our the shared screen but if youre listening to pod which is still the vast majority of people we still well talk through all of my picks here but so the question for me is what do i wanted okay two questions that there that are interrelated right and they are what do i want to do in terms of having like expensive midfielders right like how like do i want to have one two probably not three right probably impossible do i want to have holland and solid right and so until you resolve that question you almost cant put a team together right and so i had a team that i put together for last weeks pot i had cole palmer in it i talked myself out of palmer again because i want a little more balance in the squad hes just a little tricky at 106 below and behold here i am again i brought in another expensive player and i have bayo saka who was who was replaced cole palmer he is 05m cheaper so there is a certain benefit there but ill just im going to read through my im going to start with the midfield first sometimes people do these the these discussions brandon you usually work back to front but the problem is you the meat of the sandwich you exactly you frontload it with the worst part its like if you were its like if you were talking about an amazing sand like you said amazing sandwich and you started talking about the bread as the bread is the best part of the sure but no ones like so this was the this was the style of toothpick that they used to hold the sandwich together nobody cares what was the sandwich okay so i go through the midfield i have i have a couple of questions after youre after youre done there so right now ive got saka seo e salah rogers as my as my midfield five then up front ive got holland pedro and wood right so whos missing from this whos missing is a liverpool player a better forward up front right an esac type player i could turn saka into into joda and use that money to turn wood into eso that would that would thats one option i could probably find the money to turn saka into palmer although again 101 to 106 doesnt seem like that much its quite a lot right it becomes very hard to you go from having four or five like having four defenders that you can rotate to having three right its like you end up having to move into a cheaper defender i did turn lets see me smith row has turned into morgan rogers another way for me to save 05m trent has joined my team brandon as well trent however i had trent and i had cba a while back and i thought geez like that feels like a lot of money for my defense like that just it feels like a bit much especially with a couple of poor fixtures ahead for for arsenal right youre not a wealthy guy either so not a wealthy guy well especially after all these some of these team value mistakes ive made the last couple weeks i think ultim i cost myself maybe like 02 so a bit dumb but but salvageable and i probably i have probably gotten a couple of price rises for my transfers as well so its the question is do i feel like i need to have two like incredibly expensive defenders and i feel like maybe i can get away with it for now the key player here the way i see it josh is baka and you indicated that you now you you got quadruple premium if you include trent in that camp a triple premium attack between salah holland and saka some people might wonder is this the time to go without saka with a plan to get him back in gw six perhaps when there is a big fixture swing for a handful of teams saka has spurs away followed by city away spurs frankly i think is a is a is a good enough match for saka i think thats its thats the inverse of city arsenal where you expect to be nil spurs arsenal you expect it to be like 33 or thereabouts so talk to me about your s saka later i think thats the question is i want to have saka for that 6 through eight swing and do i want to put myself in a position where i have to theres not going to be a way for me to do it with one transfer right so im im almost immediately locking myself into a two transfer move to bring him back in now i dont necessarily mind that right and maybe it does make sense to go isach joda right and then turn eso into well thats a good question let me pull up the the fixture like a list of fixtures while were talking here brandon because right who would be the under the radar strikers that might just be like punt worthy for the short term is that what youre thinking so like you could go well if ali watkins pres i just think watkins is a little tricky now with their first european its not its not the hardest match right this champions league match but still it gives me a little bit of pause like another early sub coming in its like a dream run for oly to go from finish in the top four last season with villa to go to the euros scored a career defining goal to now youre in the champions league hes not going to want to miss that opportunity so he can play 90 against everton and wolves on the other hand these are the two current ly the two best home fixtures back to back for villa everton wolves the in the calendar it switch away in six as well right so its its a nice its a nice trio of fixtures lets see newcastle have wolves away ful away man city at home so two pretty good fixtures better than better than arsenals fixtures over the next two right and then they do have man city at home so its easy its there are times when you almost want to lock yourself in to transfers right like you its like you almost want to force yourself to like its almost ideal to have a match like man city at home in game week six right like theres no i dont want to have eso for that its like autopay bill online its like this money is coming out of my account on this date and i dont have to touch it because i am a believer that the like fixtures are key right like its its like even the best players will struggle in difficult fix maybe like maybe like the absolute top peak right like maybe when like with the holland solot types theres a there maybe there like you there are some players who are so exceptional that like it doesnt matter what the fixtures are but those can be counted on one hand right like and i but i think in general even the best players are going to do amazing like fairly consistently round it out over the course of a year theyre going to do amazing in good fixtures and theyre going to struggle at least comparatively in tough fixtures right and so the question is he is saka one of those players whos fixture proof right in terms of just hes going to be able to deliver no matter who hes playing and and i think thats thats the question for me thats the question i have to answer right and so so and if i went joda so they have forest and bournemouth at home i think again its like its such a work in progress for me right now what i want to do with my squad because when we potted last week i think i like the version of my squad i had when we did the last pod more than i like this version okay well i i just i feel like maybe i think that calmer that cole palmer is a little bit more fixture proof im a little spooked by the flag right and i just want to make sure theres nothing there and so i dont necessar want to have my bus team i had a more balanced squad that i was tinkering with earlier today too and that was a squad but i just think like theres it worries me to put together a squad especially a wild card squad that doesnt have like elite highend talent right its like it just feels like youre you want those players long term right and so you dont necessarily want to like get yourself in a mode where and everybody wants to do this on a wild card right you do a wild card and you want to look at game week four and and be like okay whatever game week is has ahead of you up welka right you want to be like this is an awesome team this team cant lose even though we all know that like the first week after wild card like inevitably is a bust right but like you want you want that team that just like bang like right out of right out of the gate get the top score of the weekend exactly and i think the question for me was which i think opens up and i think its fair for someone listening to ask well why did you wild card at all josh and i think the question for me is i wanted mo and and i wanted more liverpool assets and there was no way for me to get mo solid without burning points and once i realized that i by doing that i was going to start rearranging my team i just thought im fine just doing this now right im fine just making a bunch of changes right now and sol just seems like such the obvious move for everybody who doesnt have him so its to use the wild card chip instead of spending four points seems logical enough given the the banking of five transfers if you can do its like restructuring our team should in theory we havent seen it in practice just yet cuz its too early should be easier than recent seasons so wild carding for the reasons that youre explaining doesnt seem bad or a poor strategy at all to me i im im tempted myself but i think well do it for content josh i will i will do what youll wait a week ill do the opposite okay i think just in one final note on the wild card because again i know we went into it quite a lot last week but there are a couple players that i think are easy picks for wild card one of the reasons if you dont have them its a laser wild card and i think kana and anthony robinson are both great wild card picks i think lewis dunk is an excellent wild card pick as well hes not my current squad because i cant quite afford him at the moment but i think that he is at 45 an excellent pick and they have some nice fixtures ahead as well i just think hes its in previous seasons you havent been able to get him at this discounted price right and i think a 45m center back whos going to start every match who has a little bit of goal threat is a useful fourth defender to have in your squad right and sano is my like its its like the for me pick like he still has he still has not changed in price i dont know why im the only one who is excited about this guy like i think hes like i think hes absolutely fantastic and and then ive got e in my squad right now as well who i think is a like its a hes a byy low pick right hes down to 69m hes done a lot of things well and just he scored last week and got and got was it three bonus right so hes hes hes hes off the hes off the mark already and hes been unlucky to not have more returns than that has been has been widely discussed i have a one followup question on this wild card because i think its very interesting this season where there have been some disappointing higher priced forwards namely watkins and eso is in that camp as well its either holland and pedro or and your and your boy chris wood of cannot forget about chris great so the reason i bring it up is most people wild carding now will be wild carding probably into a 352 formation and its interesting to me like to wild card all of the best players and somehow that just like funnels you to a 352 and do you have you thought at all about what the for what formation comes results from this wild card at the moment it would be a 352 353 rotation right like if i went with the wild card that you and i are discussing right now which i am like already like im leaking confidence in my wild card i felt much more confident last week when you and i were talking and now i think its i think its the saka thing i think you honestly this is why its useful there are times when i hate sharing my wild card team on our discord or or on twitter because i dont want i dont want to defend my picks especially because i theres a theres a style of like of like responding to someones team that i just find very grading which is always like itll be like youll share their team and then theyll be like no soand so question mark thats the whole comment right and its just i find it so grany for some reason and but i think theres you remind me of this new yorker cartoon that i love its a father whos putting his arm around his young son and hes giving him some playground life advice and he says son if you cant say anything nice say something clever but devastating right exactly theres always that type of comment its just like wow exactly what to say about my wild card team to make me doubt everything exactly and it can be a house of cards putting these squads together right you move one you like if i take sck out right that fre up 3m that im im its going be very hard for me not to reinvest everywhere and again and the reason that i want saka long term is because its just a tricky its very tricky to handle arsenal assets correctly i think right now because they have a tough gw four and gw five right north l derby and four man city away in gw five then they have a spectacular run from game weeks six to eight lets see if i can take a quick look at it here its lester at home southampton at home bournemouth away right amazing run but then in game weeks nine and 10 they have liverpool and newcastle away in gw 10 so tough fixtures and then you factor in a bunch of european champions league matches for them as well and it suddenly does not seem hugely appealing to have arsenal assets now once thats over once theyve gone through the gauntlet of tough fixtures theyre run from gw 11 out is amazing and i think that if you have not wild carded yet i think and youre going to try to get by with like one arsenal asset one or two i do think wild carding to get your ideal arsenal 3 between gameweeks 10 and 11 does make a lot of sense i think that would be one route thats thats thats out there so i think thats thats honestly where im leaning right now knockwood so nothing devastating happens to my squad but i want to probably move saka to salah for free once the game week four deadline passes and then try to try to work out through free transfers that fixture shift in game w six and the wild card around that time so thats thats the road im walking yep and i think that i think that makes a lot of sense so so thats thats my squad more to come well well talk more on the patreon po on thursday as we get more information about

brandon we just have matches on saturday this is a true a true classic in a way brandon because you have just you have eight matches on saturday followed by two on sunday just two matches on sunday is it is it is it beyond a classic now because there is a late kickoff on saturday super classic i like its of like class its like a rum and coke what weve got going on this weekend i like the late match by the way its its a fun one because in america this means you could do nothing all day but watch the watch the premier league right dont mind if i do dont mind if i do exactly in theory its with the with the 1230 start in england you could get up and do something with you take your kids to i dont know basketball practice and its like the nfl here on sundays right you can do you can do a bunch go to church brandon i know you love to get in a couple church sessions in the mornings if you can so just bang them out whenever possible reps in get your reps in but but now 730 10 am 1230 and whats whats what window am i going to skip maybe villa everton thats although even that has some pretty big f got back your boy morgan rogers ive got a sneaking suspicion hes going to make the cut going game what it is unfortunately its the its the southampton its the early match on saturday southampton hosting man united i think thats the one that i will sadly be nobodys going to have players in this match i know i know some will still have well i think like the statistically inclined may still have bruno right hes still doing quite well in the stat tables and stuff but and it is a great its a great match for in theory and he did score today i dont know maybe theres something there the content gods cannot help themselves with man utd i predict a 21 southampton victory here it does feel like it might be southamptons first win of the season im im inclined to agree it feels like the momentum to get ten out of there its all here like there united star players coming back from an international break whats going on do they even receive any coaching wisdom from t hog at this point i dont know i dont know either i dont know whats like i dont know what hes doing anymore i dont know why hes there i its like all the ownership stuff has to get resolved you the detroit pistons and went through this a few years ago when their owner died and there was like this big ownership takeover and it was like nothing happened for like five years because it was just like the everything was happening with the ownership just took precedence right and there so theres no real steward stewardship yes of things so but i think the big question we have a couple of questions about about the game week and i think the big one is from idleb and he says captain holland or salah they both have good fixtures do we go with the norwegian legion or the egyptian magician are these are those real nicknames i egyptian see real liverpool die hards would probably not relinquish the magician from coutinho who bore that mon for some time thats right but listen were not here to be pedantic we hate that stuff i know so if you want to call him the magician go with go with it go with it you didnt want to do another religious reference you wanted to say go with god i think okay the question is there a a like s almost sted up with my words there brandon is there a statistical like thing that you could like like are there statistical things that you would look at to make this decision or does it come down to feel right youve got man city hosting brenford you have liverpool hosting forest brenford and forest are both sorry just to finish the set up here brenford and forest are both quality midtable clubs well coached have a little bit of talent defenses are fine right like not great but not terrible again you could look at data points were 3 weeks into the season like whats im not sure that there are like hugely telling points of data at this point to tell you whether like one squad is whether one defense is considerably worse than the other right or whether its reliable enough information so so what do you think like just a i think its less statistical and more personnel based for me and that takes me more to holland because i think forest have been able to play im just thinking of the fullbacks honestly the wide play forest have been able to play with i think theres still betting in some new signings but i like their wide defense a bit more and it feels more stable and brenford it still makeshift with the injury to r henry and the entire backline and we just dont rate fleen super highly i it just the personnel that city are going up against defensively augers for a holland captaincy in my mind i in general im just im going to default to holland in any scenario because i just feel like he is i do think the man city are the best team in the premier league maybe arsenal will maybe arsenal will be someday but how about how about arsenal beat them in the premier league one year before we called him the best team right like i so they just dropped points at home to brighton like i dont know why like lets lets like theres no arsenal are in a better position as the underdog anyway right they dont need anyone calling them the best team at this point so i think the man city are the best team and they have designed i feel i say this every podcast but it is important to punch home all the time which is that the best team in the premier league has designed an attack to create chances for this giant of a man this this unusually tall usually fast unusually accurate forward right who has everything that you want and they have a pretty easy champions relatively easy champions league match at midweek as well theres just no reason in my opinion to and i the argument for salah if i were to make one would be certainly you can make one is that there is he its its more likely that hes going to get assist right so theres more like it could be that the absolute top highend return for mosala is somewhere in the 20s whereas maybe for holland its more like two or three goals right and so maybe its closer to like maybe his upper range is 13 to 17 points and hollands upper range is 12 to 23 i whatever like somewhere its like a little higher but i think that its so strange to me that is strange to the right word holland has scored seven goals through three ma three match weeks sal has scored three hes got three goals and three assists holland has to score hattricks to keep up with salahs just r of general xgi or not xgi but just gi his gi track is what im following im following them more closely than the flights brandon i want to make sure that hes doing well eeden well absolutely hes going to need an ostomy bag if he keeps producing at this rate we have a great we have a theres a couple of great yogurt companies here in the united states right and so ive been sending him fj and whats the other one theres another one thats up chani chobani hes getting a lot of lot of chobani too and and then im im from iceland im sending over the siggies as well so hes got a i dont think its guil cigarets and company i hope theres no connection theres a lot of people with very similar names in iceland right so so what is more sustainable the way salah is getting these goals and assists or holland getting hat tricks every match week now theyre both exactly as sustainable its like right and its not that holland has is getting hattricks he has scored in every match this premier league season so i would just think of it i would boil it down to more essential parts and that holland and salah are both returning every game week and it doesnt have to be a little more complex than that i think the point for salah is that he apparently has more routes to fantasy points because he does as you were saying have assists in his quiver and thats thats good so longterm its salah looks like he might be winning out by gw 38 over holland i do think that theres i think that there theyre going to be weeks when theres a better case for salah right i think game week five i think is an example of that right in game week five youre going to have man city and arsenal play each other and despite the slander that i just directed towards arsenal a minute ago i think thats going to be a extremely difficult match in game week five even with man city at home and that same week liverpool host bournemouth so that week its an easy decision right theres right i think its because i rate forest and brenford to a certain degree i would say that i rate h do i rate forest defense their defense is okay i dont know i do i rate either teams defense not i think that both teams and well i think the real question is i think both teams have enough attacking potential that they will maybe keep the other team like theyre not going to like i dont think either team is going to play seven defenders in the box or what or what theyre not going to like just absolutely park the bus and try i dont know brenford in particular have shown an ability to go to tricky away matches and get returns from them and so i think that i think that they could they could do something and even forest have like a little bit of theres some real talent in that forest squad too right so i think that they could they could give both teams could give the other one a run well thats it like whats the game state going to be through much of these fixtures is maybe another way to think about it game state city brenford is city are going to be in have like 100 possession again then and brenford will occasionally counterattack and i think liverpool forest honestly probably the same the same i think brenford have a good chance of scoring in that match i would give them a pretty good shot at that but all right so thats i think its i think its tricky i think weve made i think both of us are just realistically on holland and thats just how its going to be if you had salah would you consider it more strongly do you think or you i feel like youd still be on hollands even if you it would be tempting i think i would just because thats assuming im me and i have captained holland the last three game weeks and ive captained two hattricks i feel good about that if i had hadnt had if i had captain salah the last couple of game weeks im probably just like going with whats working for my team if that makes sense all right heres another question from crim trent crim i think brandon from the independent he says is it crazy to double up on jota and louise with a free transfer before transitioning to salah on a wild card this is one of those very specific team questions that i dont havet put in the podcast but i think it is i think it does get to something that i think is interesting which is is does aoda and louise double up equal one mosala or can it like can it do in a pinch right its not easy for everybody to get to most sol unfortunately right guess the problem with this tactic is always like weve seen with jot versus diaz is ones going to score and the other is going to blank so who are you giving up to have both of these guys so if youre giving up like one of these unreliable smith bruno types or whatever right its youre probably im fine with probably okay sure it sounds cool i think the general gist of liverpool is theyre playing incredibly well they have faith in this new manager everyones in so everyones a buy all right well what about what about your squad going into game week four what are you the plan right now is to hold your transfer can i can i see can i see what your squad i want to see with my own eyes what your kelly squad looks like im gonna throw it up on the youtube and ill talk everybody through what were looking at on the podcast here so there you go were at the homepage its great its great so ive got dean henderson and go finally palace have a defense a decent defensive fixture lester at home so looking forward to that vy hatrick he anthony robinson home west ham easy cba spurs away dont love it but ill start him anyway its its like do you start cba or pedro poro do you start both no im not starting both i a classic just go with the better team and i like spurs to score but i do think arsenal are the better team and well have the better of it so we just go with that logic and then cona at home with another great fixture with everton across the midfield anthony gordon away wolves i think anthony gordon finally scored in a away goal a couple of game weeks ago so now hes very playable i i was wondering if that was like if somebody was like if you were in a position where you were planning a wild card in gw five then i think youd be in a position where the question that we just had would have at least a like i think it would be a reasonable move right going gordon to like ds d in your case right i dont think that would be like that to me would be like plus ev like theres some expected value in that move for sure i think i like it potentially i think the way the non wild card for me and the low quantity of liverpool players im it works well for me if somehow forest are able to mute liverpool and newcastle have an explosive match because i think people are getting away from gordon and eso and if gordon and eso create points then great i have gotten to salah without by escaping damage there and thats what im hoping for my the big question i have with my squad is ive got jia pager esok and holland across the front i have benched morgan rogers who do i drop to bring morgan rogers in smith row if i look at my team smith row feels like the one least likely to has the lowest ceiling perhaps than all of these guys jaia pedro we have discussed his travel coming back from south america how many minutes can we expect from him then then theres morgan rogers who hasnt even produced any fantasy points so how does he get into this starting 11 just based on itest alone so right now ive got rogers on the bench as well as pedro roro and vace so i dont know what do you think of this bench makes sense its an interesting one cba versus poro as a as a debate i think i think i would i think i would start cba over poro as well right but porro clearly has the attacking assets that cba does not so you just go with the attacking defender but i i think i would no but i think i would still go asle because i think that arsenal have a better chance keep a clean sheet in that match and i think i do think that theres a pretty good chance that the spurs score but i dont see them scoring m goals right so then its like youve got to drop a scenario where they score one goal and that goal has a poor return attached to it right so and it feels very likely that arsenal are going to score a couple in this match right so its i so anyway i think youve got that one right i think i would probably start smith row over rogers as well and im with you even though i have i was debating smith and rogers on my own wild card and i went with rogers thats mostly because of the price right its a 045m savings there and i just think that theyre close enough and i and the hope is that he eventually starts returning but but we havent seen it yet and they have the the champions league is there any chance that rogers starts to get some rests ahead of some of these champions league matches i dont know right because i i dont think that emory is just going to not try in the premier league because hes so focused in the champions league i dont i dont think thats what anybody wants or expects right so so i think its pretty close i think and i also think when stuff like this is close enough its its like you should probably dont need to sweat it too much right because its just like its hard to say whos better between the two of them this is where i know i know youre not like you dont do this they have these sports books in canada brandon you can pull one up and see whos got the better to score assist prop right and those are all algorithmically driven right so its like take a look and see what u what vegas thinks or whatever right and and maybe thats how you make your sure im not im not above that at all for sure so its i think its a tricky week for benching and well well be accumulating press presser knowledge as we get closer to the weekend do we get anything from the managers on players comment back etc but this is where im at i dont know how i ended up with this vice captaincy on jiao pedro that was before his brazil call up you got to go joda there right all right well make a live vice captains pick here right on the pond and well save our team right there beautiful always set your bus team everybody you never know when the disaster could strike to quickly go back to the question about the double up if youre if youre wild carding next week i think that i would probably lean towards e if i had if i wanted a onewe punt on a on a on a player like if i was playing the wild card in five no matter what i think that it i think he scored the goal he got in for england which i think is probably a confidence booster for him and they play ler at home i think that its hes been taking so many shots it just feels like hes right for like a big match i just got double digit returns in game week three so its i like that my general preference is to diversify and not double up so im im with you on that one too all right well lets lets wrap things up here a little early this week but this is this is the second pod of the international break its were we need news brandon we need new news so lets say if you could only pick lets say youre busy this week brandon maybe youre traveling your kids have have some i dont know rugby practice this weekend brandon you gota you gotta you got to go to a rugger tournament all right its goingon to take up your whole weekend you can record one game and watch it saturday evening on your ipad in your hotel room whats the one match that youre going to watch this weekend whats the best whats the most fun match not the fpl match but the most fun i do think it could be fulham west ham i theres something about how this west ham team is taking shape where theyre just like a real wild card just like an unexpected team a weird team and fham have they feel like theyve had a good transfer window but i dont think they have coalesced and are as unified a team as we saw with fulham last season so i think this could be a real shootout at the cottage and i think that this fm team is fun its theyre theyre in transition right now and its interesting i think that theyre fun to watch too if i were to pick one match to watch this week it would probably be the liverpool forest match i think well of well we have the north lon derby on sunday i was looking at the saturday pict but thats like almost too easy right if youre watch the nor lon i think that north london dar is going to be great absolutely i think thatll be great too but just looking at the saturday fixtures again im i its like i went so far with my metaphor that i was envisioning the per like i had an image in my head of this 47yearold mother of three brandon whos listening to the podcast right now and this is this is her one chance to break away right and shes going to she got the bluetooth headphones pluged into the ipad kids are in the other bed raising a ruckus and shes going to get away for watching metro minute so but im curious i want to see what i want to see if liverpool can keep this thing going right i want to see if they its fascinating to me with the new manager and whether they can keep it up and whether salah can keep delivering and theyre just its its a its a fun version of the squad its more fun honestly than i was expecting the post clop era to be i thought thered be more of an adjustment now of course may not last but at the moment i think its fun and i do think this for team has shown some some spark too i dont grit even some grit and like i dont i just it seems like theyre i dont think theyre i dont even think theyre quite good enough to necessarily like challenge for a european conference league spot like that but i think that theyre the squad that have enough talent like i think morgan gibbs white in particular i think is good and been fun to watch and so they its like its not your classic good team versus bad team match think that forest could give them some trouble so of course sunday we have the northland derby i think those are i find those matches very hard to predict in general right i think a lot of results are on the table if i were to go with like a boring pick itd be something like 21 arsenal ill go 32 arsenal 32 arsenal somewhere in that range both teams scoring i could see either team winning but i think arsenal probably have a little more theyre a little more organized right now like a little more stable up front it feels like they are more likely to score two goals in the match so thats your thats your pod for this week well be back on thursday with our patreon pod well be talking through wild cards maybe brandon will have been

30,alwayscheating,5Lkrt-h1r1M,Common Sense FPL Takes for All 20 Premier League Clubs (GW1–3 Review),2024-09-03T12:45:00Z,"it's like it's fine all right we are live sir over we live yep excellent thank you all right hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast thank you for joining us my name is Josh happy to be back thank you to to Pat Riley the other Pat Riley for filling in on last week's podcast and uh Brandon how are you thank you for asking Josh as always I'm doing great we enjoyed uh uh what our friends in the UK would call U uh a holiday uh today I think everyone calls it a holiday you mean a bank holiday yeah but I guess I kind of second guess myself like is the bank holiday the same thing as a holiday let's try not to get into it I needed a bit of a I needed a bit of a breather admittedly Josh from the events of Sunday I think both you and I were riding pretty high with the game week game week three going into Sunday we'll get into it Liverpool is a bit of a thorn in our Sid didn't enjoy um uh increasing your rank by 3.5 times uh in the uh the final match of the game we before a two we break I I don't want to winge too much because the fact that that one match did change the rank so much just shows early season blah blah blah we're all still very tight things will obviously change come game week four yeah but what we need to figure out here Josh is what's the plan yeah like if those who don't have Salah what's the plan those who don't have Holland what's the the plan those who don't have I don't know Brian and buo uh do we need a plan there yep I mean I don't know about him bomo uh the other the other two you know I talked about it a little bit I have not shouted this out yet but just as a heads up because I don't want to like get into too much we we promote enough stuff Brandon including our own stuff on here uh but uh I did start a substack for always cheating uh a couple of weeks ago called the FPL scouting notebook of course we're not um planting the many many great newsletters that are out there Brandon but this is just quick thoughts from every match right so I did this afternoon I'm really enjoying these I spent like a good two hours this afternoon uh they're great they're honestly great I mean when you had this idea you uh pitched it to me and you were inspired by some NFL fantasy content that you were consuming yep where is the very short brief quippy uh digestible fun email that you can just read with your morning coffee yeah after the game week is is over so just a good compliment to the Pod thank well thank you very much and it's been they're been fun to do uh I was worried I was going to fade after like one but uh after three I still feel I still feel good let's see how I feel when I'm 6.9 million you know overall but so far uh I actually was technically on a green era by the way this week uh shockingly I was up like it was one of those like 15,000 you know Green eras but I'll take it um so the substack though is just always cheating. sub.com e easy enough so um just always cheating. sub.com subscribe of course Brandon and um yeah but let's get back to to Fantasy proper I I you know yeah it was I suppose it's one of those weeks where if you had flipped the fixtures I'd be feeling great right now right I mean as as you said it's um like the timing is a big factor here right if if we had ended with the man like if Man City uh at West Ham had been the final match of the gameweek you and I would be over the moon right about this uh this miracle Green Arrow i' be I'd be talking instead of I just got a green like I I nicked a green arrow it would be I cannot believe I got a green arrow after this weekend right so it's it's all about how you how you look at it yeah I mean for me I mean we were we're separated what like by one point and last week maybe separated by 5 to 10 points I'm on a distinct red arrow like I went from 540k to uh just just the wrong side of a million uh so it's strange but I I was honestly a little a little flabbergasted at that salid what wrong can you um can you share your team with me so I can take a take a look here I'm curious uh uh sure yeah I'll bring where did it all you know where did it all go wrong I want to I want to know I mean yeah so you can see here I started game week one 2.1 mil and now we're at at at one point not one mil points are 70 points game we rank of 4 million it really went wrong in all of the like uh I guess like marginal characters Morgan Rogers is probably the biggest person to blame here because he and JIA Pedro were my two transfers I dropped the injured salanki for jaia Pedro and thought well this is a uniquely difficult fixture for Brighton going to the Emirates I and and it looked like Brighton were going to be held until the Declan rice red card y but that was a very nice um goal by Brighton ultimately interesting write ups in the athletic about how uh Arsenal's defense was a perhaps a little shambolic prior to the red card but I did feel like this goal was coming and until they got gonna have chances right I me even even Man City I mean obviously Man City have been conceding ConEd multiple goals for the season but yeah I mean the other teams always going to have chances so it's you can kind it's like it's easy to like rewrite the narrative but it is it is rare to trans because you you brought in Pedro and then you put him first on your bench which I assume was a like a price change thing right I think he was set to rise and then you assumed that salanki was set to fall he has still not fallen once yeah I guess salani was uh locked because of injury uh who bloody knows sure um and I yeah I did bring J Pedro in largely because of both salani P perhaps going down and Pedro going up up and then Morgan Rogers because I started him I thought he I I was really impressed by his performance against Arsenal and I thought surely he would get a return against Lester and Aston Villa just even though they're I mean it's it's Ona's team at this point he looks so strong in the Midfield it's interesting because they're the they're the same price and Morgan Rogers is the number 10 and Anana is ostensibly like a kind of box to box I mean he basically is doing what um oh my goodness why am I get his name the the player who who was their box tobox player last season who was Nam yeah Douglas Lise Douglas Lise thank you and you know may be that about unai Emory system that just lends itself to a little bit of freedom from these deep line players or or it's just kind of fluky but it it does feel a little unusual that you would you know basically go from this deep line player that was a great fantasy quite you know because you know he Luis was a pretty good fantasy asset last season and and for Onana to be kind of in the boat now and it's like but still I don't think I would recommend an Nana transfer his first goal came from a set piece so that one is kind of like not a necessarily would you qualify as an open Play goal sure um but yeah I am I am a little bummed about how I set up my team going into this weekend uh but you see the logic Anthony Gordon has been a differential for me and he got his goal last week which was very useful and now he's traded with ESI and the problem is esok is owned by a much larger percentage of fantasy managers and then guys like uh Smith row and cona very quiet Diego jot the Liverpool player that the one Liverpool player that you and I both own was the was the guy to not have this particular game week I okay so I was feeling very here's the here's the Silver Lining I was feeling very bad about Dean Henderson after game week two and I was already teetering and saying I want a premium goalkeeper four points from Dean Henderson feels like he basically got a 10-pointer uh and he's got a nice home fixture coming up in game wi four so I've gone from maybe strategizing changing my goalkeeper you get this is my my editorial comment here is that I I think you just get you get too worked up about goalkeepers and it's like it's a real like don't sweat the small stuff thing to me because it's just very hard to get it right the difference between a a really expensive goalkeeper and a you know in a in a in a mediocre goalkeeper is yeah marginal in terms of the total Point like you know maybe in a particular run of fixtures you want the better keeper but even though there's there's there's reasons why right that we've talked about many times before why you don't want the more expensive keeper right like let's say you get David Rya well you know what happens if Arsenal have an incredible run of attacking fixtures which they do in like seven or eight weeks you're really going to want to have one of those Arsenal Defenders right because they're great at um you know they're they're great at hoovering up bonus points you know and matches where they keep clean sheets sleep in particular uh obviously you know Gabriel's really good on set pieces Ben White gets tag returns but then you probably are going to want to have two Arsenal attackers as well right and so and so suddenly you have this this keeper who you know probably has a slightly better chance of keeping a clean sheet than a 4.5 million keeper but you've gobbled up one of your Arsenal spots right now that can't be a double up in the Midfield or HTS or whatever and he also was almost never going to get bonus points during the good fixtures right because they're going to keep clean sheets and they're going to be four-nil wins or something like that right um and even if you just like look at like just sheer like clean sheet odd percentages right it's like a a team that is heavily favored to keep a clean sheet in a match and you look at like the Vegas odds or whatever and it's like they're maybe 50% at absolute best to keep a clean sheet right and the team that you think is going to get smoked is like 40% right so the difference is is is is is pretty low so I I didn't mean to go on a little micro rant there but you know I just think like I actually um I think Henderson is a perfectly viable um you know uh goalkeeper yeah yeah for for the premium goalkeeper I think the interesting one would be Allison and that becomes sort of a discussion of where you're at with your budget and Trent and because Trent is remarkably more expensive than any of these guys and I think then Allison becomes an interesting points grabber for all those clean cheats and and possibly covering your Rivals who do have TR but anyway I I I don't uh totally disagree with you and now that the Vibes have shifted it was the great goalkeeper Vibe shift in in game we 3 for me and I'm feeling just fine with Dean Henderson um what about you let's let's throw your team up on the screen yeah so um well there's some big news uh which is that I have activated my Wild Card uh that happened a couple of hours ago I um I just was looking at everything that was happening looking at price changes looking at my squad looking at who I wanted and I was like this is going to be so exhausting to like to get there through normal transfers right it's it's like it's such a mess and I'm gonna get crushed on team value which happened to me last season and it drove me absolutely crazy at the end of the year which and honestly part of it was just me being a little disengaged I think early on in the season last year and I was sort of I was to I mean this is I think a real um a real problem and I actually you probably if if you're as disengaged as I was feeling last year you're probably not even listening to this pod right now because it's hard to I mean part of the problem is that when you get like I was off to a really bad start I both of us kind of were you know last last season and I was like screw this like I felt kind of like I just was like a little like kind of um what's the word I don't know just salty about about it right and I think like the problem then is that you don't you you like kind of get away from PL strategically right because you're like I'm just I don't want to think about FPL for like it's International break is here I'm going to go 11 days without thinking about FPL right you're not a high performance manager at that point yeah exactly and so you know in a window like that you know you might be a 0 5.6 PR like every option that might have been available to you in wild card is now done right and so I sort of was just thinking about it I was like well I kind of have to decide like literally before we do this podcast if I going to do it or not okay uh because I because it was just like I don't even have um like Pedro the way you do right and so um and so I started tinkering a little bit and I was like I just I think I like this team quite a bit better and because you can s save five transfers I don't see as much I I don't see as much of a rationale for for like waiting for like a a rainy rainy day to to play my wild card right it was like I'm just going to kind of wild card and and be slightly aggressive although I wouldn't say that I'm wild carding from like a position of great strength I mean I'm like 984 th000 overall I'm doing fine right like it's it's not like a bad start but like I just don't look at my squad and think oh yeah like I'm gonna crush it these next few weeks right I what I I look at and think oh my God how much more how much further down am I gonna go over the next three weeks before I can fix it with transfers right and so I think that was what what kind of motivated me um to go ahead and play the wild card but just before we do that I'll share um my screen with you and again I I know we're sharing screens and you know we do obviously this is still a podcast this is a an audio medium and so I don't want uh anyone to think that you know but I think just in general it's just that you you and I can look at this together right while we're um yeah of course while we're while we're talking about it um and I'll just try to be sort of conscious that I don't make reference to video stuff that um you know that people who are listening can't see um so yeah but 77 points uh in the game week it was um you know I thought um like again I F if if solid doesn't absolutely go off then I'm feeling pretty good about this game week right um I was going into that Liverpool match I was around 300K overall and uh feeling you know feeling pretty solid about kind of pushing on and um yeah I think after that match I mean I think the the interesting thing is is Joda who you mentioned already and what what we should do there um it's a question I haven't fully resolved yet because I don't um I don't know the best I don't know what the answer is with with him I mean like I think he's fine I think he's a good asset it's it's like the fact that David Louise has been out scoring him the last two weeks like I still feel like Joda is the preferred option of the two 7.5 million Liverpool midfielders I mean do you feel like L David louiz is or Douglas gez too many Lou Diaz yeah do you think you feel like Luis Diaz has now supplanted Joda as the preferred second midfields option on Liverpool well if you just take the FPL points yes obviously uh but how can we then you put yourself into this position of trying to predict the future do we think that Doo jota has had particularly bad matches the last two matches no do I think that the team functions better without J jota in the starting 11 100% not so it then it becomes a very difficult question of how long of a view do I want to take how patient do I have to be to actually get the value that I need out of Diogo jot and that's just a harder question to answer I I don't feel like if you're if you're thinking I just want to spend one free transfer over the international break jota to Lis Diaz doesn't feel like a worthwhile transfer to me not at all if not a step backwards right I mean it almost feels it's a little bit it's not quite the same because not as extreme but it's a little bit like the Morgan Rogers Onana situation right it's like looking at what we've seen so far you'd think yeah maybe Onana is the guy right but then if you sort of look at it more rationally and you just look at like positioning and right like shots and you're like I I you know you still kind of feel like you want I think Joda and you want Morgan Rogers uh of you know if you had to pick you know two of those four so um yeah but I think I think it's really tricky um and so yeah I unfortunately I think what bumed me out a little bit my you know my transfer are both kind of bust I brought in concept and Smith row um I think honestly this is really why I have decided to Wild Card by the way too is I just um I just made too many mistakes in my uh in my gameweek one draft and I I just can't quite solve them all through transfers and I mean I have Lewis Hall who set to drop in price uh tonight we'll see if it actually happens right the price changes have been a little unpredictable but uh Hall set to drop in price um I haven't even had a chance to move him yet right because I had to move k quansa um I had to move anduku um you know I guess those are kind of the the you know the biggest ones but even like sun like I sort of feel a little caught out right now with sun I mean I got a great return from him game week to but at the moment it feels like I kind of have the fourth best of the expensive midfielders I have the fourth best one right and so that kind of feels like another issue that I I want to solve but I you know you know and if I could just go from like sun to Palmer or whatever uh or even just get solo with like two transfers I I you know I might have considered just just doing that even if I had to burn four possibly um but it's the fact that I have to fix all these other issues still right that make it that make it tricky and so um even Harwood Bellis even a pre 60 Minutes not not that anyone's gonna lose sleep over your your like last guy totally I mean may maybe Harwood Bellis too exactly so um well you're were going to say something about flicking you've got beef with flein now ah he's trash whole defense is trash I I don't know you know I'm sure it'll I'm sure when gameweek 38 rolls around flein will be the third highest rated keeper on the season and I will miss out on every amazing return of his I'm sure that's true but um I don't I don't I like this Brighton team Brandon I want to continue liking this Brighton team I'm not positive I can like this Brighton team if I have right brenford yeah both you know but maybe he'll trans like them all maybe he'll move in January to to brighten who knows right um so yeah so I'm referring to B no uh Branford uh I want to continue enjoying watching this brenford team play and I can't right now because I am I'm stricken with anxiety over when fleckin is going to concede a goal and it seems to come later and later each week you know and so uh and so yeah I just want I want this trash out of my team um I actually kind of like brenford long term uh I think it's around gameweek seven maybe when they have a really when they started a really nice run of fixtures and I think Johan Wisa is somebody that we haven't really talked about too much but with Ivan Tony you officially is it did he go to Saudi Arabia wherever he went I haven't seen any news yet yeah no I think that transfer happened on Deadline day so with with with Tony gone um and the forward they signed injured until like the end of December basically yoan wi has it's it's his spot right and he's he's a six million forward uh who is like I don't he's not like the most you know I mean he doesn't blow you away when you watch him in these matches but it's like it's a really competent team right it's like a well- coached well-managed team like if you had to pick between Mooney and and vissa for example like maybe it's a bad example because vissa already has a couple goals in the season but there's just something about like I just feel a little more confident that like that we're going to get some something more out of out of Visa right like you like looking five 10 weeks ahead yeah I like that I mean Ando and Visa together they're like a great Duo and that's they you know they're like just one of those lowkey fantasy Duos where you're like well you could kind of get either one depending on your budget and your team set up and you probably get the share of some spoils from whatever goals that brenford are going to score yeah yeah exactly right and that's and and and emomo is a little harder to get because he's 7 million uh maybe uh maybe e turns into emomo at some point for some managers right like there's a that's an easy um kind of sideways move uh but you know so those are those are some things that uh I've been kick I actually don't have um Visa in my uh my squad right now they have a couple tough fixtures coming up so I think he's he's like he works a little better as a later transfer uh but I will share with you Brandon um this is like a first you know a first draft of a of a wild card team so take it with a you know a big grain of salt I uh I don't I have not firmed up up um you know where what I'm thinking here um I think the the goalkeeper spot is kind of the first question for me and if you were making a goalkeeper transfer this week or you're wild carding um I think that Kappa I mean and like and I'm like firmly in the like I I wish I could just like literally roll out I would rather take an extra four million and just get a zero every week right like if that were possible um like I just coldkeepers are so worthless in this game I feel like and so it it's coming down to Kea and uh Dean Henderson for me as my as my goalkeeper pick and okay I don't know I'm sort of I thought Kea had Kea had a nice performance um in his Opening match I mean obviously they did concede a couple of goals but um uh I don't know I I feel like he might be he's he's a talented keeper uh I don't know I mean you're stretching you're stretching well listen you find me a keeper that you actually want right now I mean yes yeah if if you include Allison then yes but right like in the sub bracket find one that like gets you excited sure yeah there's there's no way to win or lose this conversation I mean you're basically going from flecking to flecken and that and that and that's fine on a wild card you have that luxury get whatever flecken you want yeah born the fixtures coming up they're home hosting Chelsea followed by Liverpool then it's a good coupling with Southampton and leester and then the fixtures are diabolical starting in game week 8 City it it's it's true tricky it really is uh the question is really whether you um should even look like I mean you want to look in the kind of medium term I suppose right um but like I I think think the problem is if you look at it through a I actually was thinking about that I was like well which like cheap keeper has already gotten a couple of tricky matches out of the way and I mean unfortunately that might lead me back to flecken uh which like that would be really depressing if I like wild card had flecken out and then Wild Card him back in days quite an incredible story you just wild carded the same team you had in gameweek one just go can you IM you just went straight back no I actually think I might end up with Dean Henderson though um I do feel better about it now that gayi stayed right I think that and they did they did make a center back signing as well and so I think I think they're okay I'm still amazed that they let Anderson go I felt like he was good for them last season I don't get it either yeah good good has he started yet for fulam I I probably started in the efl Cup match and at that point I thought he was like a dead certain to like start every other Fulham game From Here to Eternity and he did not start over the weekend it was Depp and bie again yeah um so we'll see I mean ultimately he's destined for the starting 11 it's just a matter when yeah I feel like you wouldn't uh they and they must have given him some kind of assurance right like you wouldn't he wouldn't leave a starting spot at Palace to be a backup he's captaincy material like as soon as as soon as karney gives that up uh FPL FPL captaincy right because you've been you've been captaining you've been captaining Tom Kerney in FPL for the first three weeks you call me Captain Carney uh and that that's that I'll never change I'll never change I refuse so um so my backline is um keeping Robinson of course I think he is uh absolutely fantastic and I mean it just like he's turned into such a like Amazing Fantasy asset because he's now getting attacking returns consistently enough that even when they concede he is he's valuable right he's got two assists and and two bonus in the season and um I feel really good about him at 4.5 um I think Kana is another one where um you know it's unfortunate that they conceded to um Lester a little late in that one as well but um I feel I feel good about him too right it's just a cheap way into a competent defense um Lewis dunk I think uh is another one where it's sort of he's 4.5 and uh again you know talk about a kind of like captaincy you know Captain Center back kind of player right he's just like a super reliable solid can can Nick a couple of headed goals every season you know type option um so it's it's a pretty cheap back line and then I've got um celba as my one expensive Defender the one question for me is whether there's any short-term value in moving celba to Van djk um for for a couple of weeks um possibly moving back to SBA at some point but at the moment my plan is just is just to roll with CBA and and and save my transfer uh and then I've gone with Axel tonbe as my um as my four million Defender I mean you pick it's it's like it's like the goalkeeper thing right you pick you pick a four million guy they're all terrible just don't spend more than four million right uh yeah right and uh and I don't know like there are like moments when when Brighton seem kind of kind of Saucy and fun you know and you're like well maybe maybe there's like a match where they just everyone get it switch feels saucy totally why do I keep saying Brighton I I got Brighton on the brain you're really I mean I'm counting two Brighton players in this team so and that's that's more more Brighton players than you often see so you're definitely thinking about it yeah our friend James Holland who came on the patreon Pod who's a been a long time I switch season ticket holder fan is he's yeah he he told us he he picked I switch to optimistic as he is to finish 15th in the table you'd think there's some points that have to be coming for this team uh sooner or later I mean I guess they picked up a point against Fulham for instance yeah and leaf Davis the Le Leaf Legend we need some kind of little nickname for him uh yeah Leaf Legend though picks up uh I think he got an assist and two bonus in this match so he is he is off and it's you know I mean God if he was four million he'd be like one of the most um players in fantasy but at 4.5 it's just a little too much a little too much switch for my blood Brandon but at 4 million let's let's let's let's toss one of their uh options on the bench uh through the Midfield um the big thing here is I have Palmer and solo so am I chasing points I don't know I mean I'm probably getting like the second and third best fantasy access in the game so I I don't really feel like that bad about it um and part of what I like about it is I feel like there's a version of this like I feel like there's a kind of rotatable like a rotating third forward that I can use here as well and so um I it almost feels like I've got a little too much money in my Midfield still um but at the moment I I've got uh Smith row who I'm holding on to uh maybe maybe I shouldn't be I I mean I thought he was really uh kind of just like I don't know he was out of it in that if switch m i i i he had a couple chances like right before he got subbed right like and that was kind of I think I think what you're seeing with Smith row is just a young man who has played his entire life at Arsenal at one club and as talented as he is going to a new club across town it's it's not easy especially for for the younger players and he's being a lot is expected of him like he's coming now into Fulham and they expect him to be like the the the general of that attack it's going to take time I think and I agree like he looks a little you he he's not there yet he's not finished and so he might turn into Morgan Rogers which would save me like 04.5 that probably that probably is the sensible move right um I mean honestly I could get Onana if I wanted but I I I I still feel like I feel like Rogers is still is still probably the more sensible pick there it would also make a for a little bit less of a benching headache I I just feel like it's always tricky when you've got when you've got basically eight Midfield starters right that you want to play like or you know when you've got sort of uh three forwards and five Midfield ERS all of whom are sort of competing and every single week you're sort of I don't like having that kind of headache in fantasy right yeah let me ask you this about this draft and we we talked a lot about fifth midfielder before gameweek one and I ended up with a 5.5 Bron Diaz is my fifth mid yeah you've thought about this a little bit uh you've gotten off Harry Winks you now have your fifth attacker would U be Sano or Smith row at 5.5 where are you at with the 4.5 guys like Morgan Rogers is as low as you think you can go given what we've seen so far no I I mean I think so just because I I I do think that like you you get quite a lot from him at five I think he's 5.1 now right you get quite a lot from him at 5.1 is that worth the extra 0.5 million or point6 or whatever probably is honestly uh and I think what makes it and so just to quickly go through my Midfield right now I've got uh Salah Palmer e Sano and Smith row and Sano to me is just correcting a mistake akake um and actually it was kind of the impetus for the wild not I shouldn't say the impetus but one of the reasons I sort of was convinced we can call the empatis of Salwa this yeah Sal yeah that's right Salo is absolutely 100% the impetus even Cole Palmer is like a luxury move that you can do when you're wild carding right um but the what was you know seano not having risen in price even once is kind of shocking uh considering that like in every in every like way that you look at him I feel like he's been fantastic like he the the underline stats are good the actual FPL stats are good and he looks awesome right even if you're just watching highlights of these matches like seano is heavily involved right like he looks like he's really even you know even with salanki out he's gonna take on a lot of you know attacking you a lot of the attacking potential and so um he's just like kind of a I think for most managers a square peg for any problematic round hole that we have so Joe Pedro is super cheap for the third forward at 5 .5 Morgan Rogers is as we discussed like probably the cheapest fifth mid you'd want and Sano is he's 5.5 right so yep uh it's rare that people are paying enough attention to Bourne myth and have a 5.5 hole they need to fill unless you're in a situation like this where I mean I just did it last week I mean I got I got Smith row over smania but like I think but if you're trying to get an expensive basically if you're trying to fit three premiums into your squad you're going to need to fill it out with some of these cheapies right and and I think the problem then is you don't necessarily have players you want to start every single week right and I think that's where to get back to your question about the more expensive bench option right I think that's where the um having a more expensive player makes more sense because you can kind of uh you know talk like you can you can rotate them a little bit and so um so then my forward line and this to me is is the problem I suppose uh is um I mean is it a problem I guess you you tell me right and so the problem is that I have um I have Holland obviously uh Holland's not going anywhere uh and uh and I just don't care I don't I don't like any version of my squad that doesn't have him in it I don't care how much how many other spots I can upgrade okay like maybe maybe I'm missing who's talking about getting rid of Holland at this point well just a lot of people are like there's like the kind of um Advanced stats folks are kind of like dropping him in the short ter I don't know probably not before the brenford match but maybe ahead of game with I I don't I don't want to get into it because my my goal this season is not yeah yeah you and I are not going to um no flame Wars this year Brandon we're on we're on a firmly on we're we're just this is a friendly friendly World we're not GNA get our We're Not Gonna stick our foot in the uh we're the Swit of FPL exactly we're an island onto ourselves and so so what I have is i' I have Holland I have Jaa Pedro who um I honestly to me that's another mistake that I'm correcting I just I should have been on him uh uh you know from well actually I mean I I mean it's I don't really know I guess I I guess I I don't need to kick myself too much because the player that I got was Chris Wood and Chris Wood's been excellent and in all three of the matches including gameweek two where he blanked he was really good and I I'm sure a lot of people out there have not watched like any Forest so far this season but he's been great and you know he's he's you know in this last match he I think he took five shots in the match scored a goal had a brace late that got chocked off uh played the full 90 minutes I think there was some risk like earlier about whether he was gonna you know be kind of rotating a little bit but he's he's been I think he's been absolutely fantastic so far this season and so my feeling with him now is maybe I just keep him and I just and I just sort of rotate him a little bit and that he's probably solid enough that that you don't necessarily need to uh move him for one of these kind of other options that have been a little inconsistent and so the problem though is you know there's no Wally Watkins in this squad there's no um there's no ESO right like there's a number of players that um that I can't have and that's just sort of the price you pay if you're going to have Holland Salah and Palmer right that's a that's almost what is that I mean 27 it's almost 40 million of my 60 million budget in in three players I mean it's absolutely insane right the gamble you're making here which is I think why you're making it is it's one of the bet better bets you could place is you're you're taking Cole Palmer over a second Striker basically you've got two third tier Strikers and Cole Palmer yeah I think that's I think that's exactly right and uh and also I guess banking that like these 5.5 million guys uh or what you know I'll just use starting prices here right but the 5.5 million guys Sano Smith row Pedro Morgan Rogers you know you pick the kind of three or four options there that those players can be good enough right that they can sort of get you to like a a 6.5 um is uh you know option be best as uh Ivanka Trump would say I don't know what that I have no idea what that's reference to um but so that's that's where I am um and so uh yeah that was kind of unexpect I kind of I thought I would kind of drop that on you brand you didn't know I was going to reveal I had no idea and then you actually showed us a draft I mean I thought you were going to tease it for next week you know we got a whole International break to work through but I guess still you're going to see a whole different Draft when you turn tune in to always dream next Monday very very likely exactly and uh yeah and you know honestly I will say to and not to do a second shout out for the substack but part of the value of of doing this is I have been watching match highlights of everything that I kind of missed over the weekend and you do like you really do like you don't have to be ready to subsec do this but like if you're if you're like taking fantasy seriously you should be watching highlights I mean you don't have to I mean like you know they always whatever I'm sure I'm sure you can watch them in any country you're in right but in like NBC um and peacock they have the extended highlights and right and sometimes you look at them and you kind of like H like this is like 13 and a half minutes I don't have this much time but for whatever reason they decide to spend four and a half minutes on the lineups at the start of every one of these and then they show you you like the opening minute of the match right so all you have to do is you pull up the extended highlight you skip forward about 3 minutes and 40 seconds and then you're where you want to be so you're really watching like a f minute highlight package and I think it is a quick way to be like oh wow like like you know Morgan Rogers is one of these players who like if you just looked at his returns you're like ah like three straight blanks but you know I think especially in those first two matches you saw somebody who was really involved right in the villain I mean obviously this is why you brought him in but like you know had a game week three but um you know you just you see things that you don't necessarily see if if you're just looking if if you're just watching the featured matches and um and then looking at FPL results right points well I'll be uh I'll be jealous of you having mosala going into game week four I my my current plan is I have to roll unless I want to take a hit to get Mo which I don't think I do I think ultimately what I need is two free transfers to get Gordon and jot out and Salah for a fifth mid any chance that you would Wild Card yourself have I talked you into it a little bit if I play well um I mean I don't look at my team and say uh I see problems when I look at my team but um no not I I'm not feeling the stress uh that you clearly and and you're not necessarily feeling the stress I understand you're kind of like you just feel like this is the the best strategy for you and I get that yeah I guess what I would say is I'm feeling um very engaged with the game right now you know like feel like um like I'm sort of I'm feeling good about like my ability to kind of make confident decisions right and just sort of like trust my instincts a little bit and so that's that was what is what kind of has pushed me to do it right just feeling like yeah let's go for it let's let's try yeah clearly a lot of our listeners are kind of thinking either wild card or the price Market is kind of like in full swing right now and going into the international break usually there's a lot of action at the start of the international bre especially the first one when people are like re reine tuning their team and then the market should probably slow down in a few days and you can kind of chill out and and take a step back for the middle part of the international break but a couple questions here one from stepen cus who has thoughts on early transfers to navigate price Rises price Falls earlier in the season and during International breaks and John Reynolds has uh said nobody ever should I use all three of my free transfers during this break so I think from your perspective Josh you you are seeing these price changes and are thinking that's going to be something you're going to feel the effects of later in the season so you know and you agree with this right I mean I think of you as somebody who's very like conscious of of price changes and and sort of like the market yeah and I think it's fun to take advantage of it at this point Joe Pedro is a great example of this where he's going you're going to make money off of this guy over the break and you don't you don't have to bring in these players thinking I'm a I'm a 100% believer in jaia Pedro you could actually turn just just being a two to three week believer in jaia Pedro is going to mean you can make a better financial decision with your team later on in the season and especially when you're looking at that late season Wild Card the more money you have the better uh so I I am for like playing the price Market earlier in the season the trick with early transfers in the international break is Lord knows what's going to happen to these guys when they go off to their International Teams I think I'm like more compelled to go for guys in the FPL transfer market who maybe don't have an international call up yeah that's true I mean I they're not traveling and all that sort of thing I guess and it's kind of like situational too right like I feel like um if you have like a decent bench like if your bench is decim ated right and like if one more player gets injured then you are absolutely going to have to um like and you use like you use your transfer early and like your team is basically 11 strong right and like one injur is going to kill you then then maybe don't use the transfer early but if you have like a little bit of bench dep then then I think it's fine to go ahead and do it I mean I don't know I don't think like it's I don't think we get that many we don't get as many um International break injuries as we kind of think we do right yeah it's a bit like um holiday rotation right this idea that like you've got to go 15 deep on your in your squad for the for the holidays right because there's so much rotation during you December and then you look and you're like like everybody played every match you know it's like yeah maybe pep like outside of like Man City though you're probably pretty safe well I feel like we've already given a pretty good gift to our listeners there with the Wild Card talk but we do have a bonanza coming up after kind of a a short sort of housekeeping break here where we're going to go through all 20 clubs and just give

for your chance to get those $500 gift cards all right Josh now it is time to do our Common Sense fantasy takes I think you expressing this through your wild card are saying 3 weeks is kind of this we're at this pivot point where now we've got like critical mass with data information grass test data test we now have real sort of like takes to get us to the next step in the season yeah and I think the the real goal here is to do what I think um you know I think especially because we're we're we have we have two weeks right to to sort of do some thinking ahead of um you know ahead of gameweek four and so there's it's a chance for us to to basically like take a step back and sometimes again I talk about like the forest from the trees and I think I really got caught up in this kind of thinking last season which was I was really letting other people take the temperature of of the season right and like when it came to transfers or went to Wild Card do all this kind of stuff I was relying way too much on what other people were saying right and it was because I felt like I didn't have my own kind of rules of thumb about each Squad right uh heuristics if you will brand you know if I didn't have these these 20 heuristics that were about to that that' be a great that' make sure that no one listened to this episode great keyword just became a great uh title for the podcast episode so basically um and again we've already like we're like 50 minutes in already but we're going to do basically these are going to be um like one kind of lightning round big picture thought for all 20 clubs okay so um you know just kind of like quick thought and and obviously this you know we're going to keep this fantasy focused right but like but just kind of one oo the lady round is on so um let's get going here let me just going to sitp for my I have a rare that I I I pod with a CPE glass brand we have a comment in the in the chat from our friend Pat who was on last week he says you're sipping on a fancy glass you can check us out on screen on our YouTube page but yeah what you get so you got what you got my wife my wife turned in uh the final draft of her book to her publisher and so we were yeah you played tiny part in that as well Brandon you got a got my fingers and everything I fingers in that um so uh yeah not getting it published but just in the actual design um so yeah we're just supporting the the real talented people in our lives that's what we do we're celebrating tonight so that's that's amazing all right so that's I'm extra spicy this evening um yeah so let's go into it I think um you know I think the the the more interesting way to do this maybe uh I I was going back and forth I was like should it be alphabetical should it be um table order and I've decided that that table order is the way to go because ultimately the teams at the top of the table are the ones that fantasy managers are tend to be more focused on and so I think it makes sense uh to start there and and so um we're really just going to go uh one through 20 and uh and and talk about these clubs and then um and again we're g to keep it fantasy focused and then um next week we'll do more of a proper game week four preview but there's really no point in doing that ahead of a whole week of of international travel and fixtures and things like that right because there'll be some there'll be some breaking news I mean half the half the league might move to fenerbache Brandon in the next handful of days right so we just we just don't know by the way I saw a picture of Jaden Sancho on the pitch on Sunday and I was like I somehow just completely missed that he moved I and I know I knew there was like rumors about him moving but him moving to Chelsea I mean I actually started laughing when I saw it because I was like what is he he's like the ninth like I don't know whatever I guess I we don't need to get into that do we that could be our an ear our yeah that's that's that's a hard pass too much uh oxygen has been devoted to the Chelsea you're right you're right you're right you're right what I what I think is actually interesting about it is is Manchester United kind of came up with nothing because for a while there was going to be a swap with Raheem Sterling Raheem Sterling ends up at Arsenal and Manchester United like here's who did they get they didn't get anybody they're still playing Marcus Marcus rashford so that's very fun for them yeah yeah yeah yeah Mason mount's injured now too right so it's like yeah um so all so let's start at the top of the table here uh here's my first thought on mince maybe we'll go like uh back and forth how about that I do one you okay yeah and then if you have an extra you have an extra thought we can we can add it but my my uh first thought on Man City uh to kick things off here and first first overall at the moment tied with Liverpool on nine points uh I suppose they're head yeah they're head on go different they're tied on goal difference but they've scored two more goals um my my first thought of man city is that um the defense uh probably needs to be um re-evaluated and like we probably basically my thought is that we shouldn't be drawing any real conclusions about their defense at the moment because uh the like Rod has they they just haven't had Roder for the first three weeks and he is he though not a Defender himself is incredibly important to the defense and not only is he not there to protect the defense but I also wonder if it has forced them to play gardial as as a as a center back right like I I wonder if if pep has not had the confidence to like let him push forward more right um as a result of not having rodri in the center because I feel like we saw a more kind of attacking leftwing version of him in the past and he's he's been pretty pinned I feel like to the to the back line yeah yeah that is interesting um I feel like guardi it's it's just more of I I think it's less about the form in the tactics and more gardial might just be a slow starter we saw this with him at the start of last season and City just seemed to find that like that destruction Rhythm uh sort of Midway through there they they're are oneman fantasy team right now and the pleasure and maybe when foden is I don't know yeah but at the moment it's you're right it's it's a one-man team and so uh there's there's not like the problem is there's no value anywhere else right it's not like it's not like there's a 4.5 million defender in there I mean actually there is and Rico Lewis but I don't necessarily trust him um with Rod coming back right to be a consistent starter right because Rico Lewis's great cool fantasy value is that inverted fullback thing that he does and now uh Walker finally got on the pitch in gameweek three so yeah that's just like a firm wait and see so for Liverpool then it's kind of like I think the common sense take here is it's the complete opposite of Manchester City and that Liverpool are the Manchester City of this season as far as fantasy where you're like how am I going to fit all of the guys who I want into my team and you would want yeah for me on a midfielder I mean they don't really have any forwards so you don't have to worry about that um but but what's fascinating about this new season with Liverpool is I think I was able to talk myself into not having mosal game week one because I thought Arnie slot's coming in who knows what the level of discontent or discom population is going to be and what we have seen is whether it's to do with slot or whether it is just these players being veteran winners is this Liverpool team looks like they kind of want to send this version of Liverpool off into the sunset on a real high from Van djk to Salah and everyone in between they're just like in some incredible form and I think going to be dealing with Liverpool assets all season for the good like so get as many Liverpool assets as you can a Pronto yeah and that that's the other issue with my wild card is I only have one at the moment and Salah it's hard to get even more than one in if you're G to go really expensive I mean it may be that Cole Palmer just can't fit I mean that that would that's the only that you know if I did that I could I could still have Joda and Trent like that's interesting does like a 4.5 million Defender and Cole Palmer is that worse than Joda and Trent like it's actually a really interesting question well I mean spoiler alert for whatever we're going to say about Chelsea but I do think that it's much it it's overstated with Cole Palmer right now I do not think that he is necessary for a fantasy team that's doubled with Salah and Holland okay I think he's and and it's like I love I have nothing bad to say about the player and the fantasy it's the price the price is illogical if you're going for Holland plus Salah and I see really no way around that and that might be me just playing as a template manager but I just think it's it's true it's facts no I I I think it's true I think the uh part of my thinking there was I could kind of maybe do a little back back and forth with him and and Saka right like you know like follow like following the fixtures a little bit this feels like I don't think I've ever heard you talk about you know swap in swap Hoke pokei I think we're yeah we always you and I don't like to say it because it's hokey pokei in America it's hokey kokei in the UK we're very aggressive and we're very finger pointing uh Centric here in here in the US we we poke people exactly we we Hoke and we poke we also Hoke people you know we do both really yeah uh um so yeah I think it's uh you might you might be hon again this is actually exactly why this exercise is useful right because when you look at in a big picture sense you're like yes what do I think about Liverpool what I think about them is that I want three of their assets right um and so that that that is that's very interesting so that's that's something for me to think about a little bit um that would also enable me to maybe get Ali Watkins or dare I say uh Nico Jackson um but let's let's let's let's put a button in that for a second let's go on to to Brighton and hve Alby and Brandon um there's a lot to say here obviously um we talked about Pedro already um I think uh Mina is an interesting talk about another 5.5 million player I think he's playing Super well um he's the uh the right winger for um for Brighton and um finally picked up an assist I guess it was one of those like rebound assist but he honestly could have scored on the chance right and so he was well in yeah and so I think uh I think the Mina is a um really good you mean like I'm not like first name on the Wild Card level right but I just think he's like I think he's he looks really good I think the whole team I just like I just admire Brighton so much like I admire um like every like the way that they do business while still seeing competitive is super impressive to me like it's they're they're like they should be like the Envy of every like kind of non top CL and they make uh hiring new managers look easier than like most other uh teams in Europe you know herler is like hit the ground running he looks great looks confident the team looks great and I'm with you on MTA MTA is basically like uh Moma on the right hand side but for cheaper so I think that's a great budget call yeah I think M be 65 or seven and and mint is 55 so um yeah not as not as like uh polished maybe as yes correct yes I would agree with that yeah matoma Pro price rose up to 6.6 so there's a 1.1 one savings there big big difference then huge actually really all right so we're on to Arsenal now Aral the take here is I the the take is it kind of changes week to week after gameweek one I thought the only player anybody needed in their squads was Kai hyberts after gameweek two I thought the only player anybody needed in their squad was Bai Osaka after game after gameweek or or Rya for for that matter Arsenal are simil so like I was saying with Liverpool get them all Arsenal is kind of like pray that you're lucky week to week that you have the guy who gets the points and that goes for their Defenders as well is Gabrielle finally gonna get his corner kick goal this this match who knows so Arsenal I think have presented decent enough value but they appear like they're going to be a frustrating team to buy into fantasy wise because you can always justify having them and they might not pay you back the way these like Surefire bets from Liverpool and erling holl might what do you think about Saka I mean like three returns in three but it's like it doesn't it's like he feels like he just feels like such a step below um Palmer Salah and um and um and Holland as like as like the kind of like it's like a premium asset I disagree in that I think Saka will outscore for Palmer uh this season I think he's a better pick than Palmer okay all right I'm excited to get to our Palmer section then uh I want I want I want to see what you have to say there but let's move on to but just just like just real quick on on Saka I I I don't totally disagree with you on the sort of skepticism there because the question remains Saka ceiling is is really it's fuzzy I don't want I don't know what it is so that's really the red flag for exactly because it's he's super consistent and obviously that's it's hugely valuable but it's like if you look at like a a Luis Diaz and I know small sample you know Etc ETA we always have to say that but like you know if you look at like what Diaz or Joda have done in the first like three weeks for example right it's like they're not necessarily as consistent but they are like because they're a little more explosive in terms of their returns it kind of averages out to the same right especially when you factor in um the three million price difference between them right so um I don't know there's there's there's you know something to think about there um all right let's move on to Newcastle my my thought on Newcastle is I'm kind of impressed that they're in fifth like it feels like feel like they shouldn't like they've had three pretty underwhelming performances to start the season um they locked into a win versus versus Spurs they were under the C by Spurs for a good deal of that match but you do I guess I do tip my hat to Newcastle for for grinding out that's a how you kind of have to do it some some weeks y I feel maybe a little bit more optimistic like there are like green shoots for Newcastle and I think I think we will see much better from them maybe the international break will be rejuvenating just out of curiosity at newcastle's fixtures coming up it's Wolves Away in game we four followed by Fulham City Everton Brighton it's not like a great run to be honest mix bag yeah yeah so I I I think I'll be ready to get rid of Gordon for sure coming going into game week five and that will hopefully work into my Solem move yeah that makes that makes sense um so yeah not a lot maybe it's just there's not we don't have a lot positive to say because we started out this season really I I started the season with with two Newcastle I wanted to have three and I had to move move out of Gordon at the last minute for yeah I almost did Nick poop is yeah exactly so it's like but they're they're sort of putting together some kind of U I don't know they just it's it has not been inspir like you said maybe um the fact they haven't played inspired and there they're still you know seven from nine is uh um says something um all right so that we move now to uh yeah this one's pretty easy it's it's exactly what we said at the top of the show Ivan Tony is officially out of the mix therefore you are free to get momo and Visa uh and that's really all you need to know yeah their pictures are bad coming up so this is something you can sort of put a pin in and come back to but that's those those are the that's the real deal that's the news but they and they and they do get better right because um I was I was looking earlier and they are um I think it's and by the way and bomo is now up to uh fifth overall in points for midfielders like he is he is really uh doing quite well and we're we probably have to like start taking him more seriously as a as a buy um but yeah once you get past uh City away Spurs away in four and five it's a really nice run they have three home fixtures in four one of those home fixures zip switch at home Fulham Bournemouth Everton Lester um you know especially if you're if you're targeting in those those like like Visa right there's a it's a really nice really nice run and um there's there you know I think that that could be really interesting so um all right so let's move on to Aston Villa I mean we did talk about uh you know we we I mean we talked about Onana and Rogers a fair amount already so we've kind of already done our Villa section think about the defense on Villa because that's you know Emory his calling card has been defense typically yeah so what it's four four goals conceded you should be able to freeze the uh the top of the table here like kind like an Excel you know so that I could see but I what is it four goals for four goals against then for them um yeah I mean I just don't see it as a problem long term right the Personnel hasn't changed really I mean they they have lost Douglas Louise but um I just really have a lot of respect for Emory as a manager right I just think he's gonna sort it out I mean they still have Emy Martinez and so I think it's just kind of fluky right like they absolutely could have kept a clean sheet in that Lester game right it was like they Lester basically had one chance and that was the one they scored on and so just happened to fall to the goat exactly yeah yeah so okay yeah yeah yeah so I think the frustrating thing for Villa is they just haven't really become as fantasy relevant as we expected them to be and by the time they might be ready then Champions League will begin totally and it'll be the added layer of anxiety of what's gonna what's Watkins minutes he still going to be a 65 minute sub yep exactly it's hard to say and with Duran playing so well right I think that's it it complicates things because you don't need Watkins to play the full 90 every match I you have seen a good amount of squad depth at Villa at the start of this season so that's at least encouraging in terms of what you know how maybe Emory won't have to rotate the starting 11 so much it's just that he's just going to have the limit guys minutes match match to match all right Bourn myth in eighth position they've got two draws and a win they've had to grit them out that draw against forest was a last minute Sano goal and then and violation of a of a complete uh supporter group in Everton this weekend just like thoughts and prayers go out to them and to Sean D's team but does he make it through the the the international break like it's I yeah it's a little bit like Manchester United and that like where do you start with all of the problems at this club like new owners that's not going that you know that might be a start but that's going to it's a long-term thing new manager I don't know Squad just doesn't seem very good anyway we're talking about Bournemouth and it's the opposite I think Bournemouth kind of they're under the radar right now lest you forget they have a fantastic manager and weirdly a squad that's more cohesive dare I say better than you think I guess the the FPL takeaway is what your wild card showed and Sano is a legitimately good fantasy pick expect more returns from Bournemouth as we go yeah there's sort of I mean I know I talked about like Brighton being the kind of Envy of of the mid-table or whatever you want to call it I don't mean that in a in a derogatory way but like I it's almost like Bournemouth are like the Envy of like the the teams that should be in the bottom you know it's like they don't have like a huge budget it's like there's there's really like not um like they're just sort of but it's like almost impossible to imagine them going down this season right like there's just something about the the like the the quality of their like they a good coach that it's like there's enough kind of competent players in that Squad and it's sort of it's it's it's impressive like this has nothing to do with fantasy really but like they're just you know I I like they're like a fun team to watch I think too like they I've enjoyed watching them Bournemouth if you're if you're watching or listening we admire you all right we admire you yeah I'm glad this yeah I'm glad this one fell in your lap not inam Forest yeah I mean uh Chris Wood uh I think he's been I I've talked a lot about Chris Wood so far have you I don't know how much Forest you've seen at all but like do you have any thoughts on Chris Wood never primary screened Forest this season uh second screen or goal Rush sort of situation I'm impressed that wood has has um you know he's he's generated the fantasy points he has yeah the consistency so that's great I have I have no quarrel with him great I think the question is when's the right time to get off of Chris Wood it's sort sort of like you've got the he's already given you the gift now you know you go to a party and you don't want to outstay your welcome yeah I I think that's right and I think that he is um uh I but there's something to be said whether I keep him on wild card or not there's something to be said for a um you know like basically like a forward who can return in bad fixtures that is not a guarantee like we we like we've seen many many times over the years forwards like who like oh they have a great run of fixtures like he's cheap like surely he'll get something in those matches right but Chris Wood is one of those players who he's not like when they play a really good squad he's not going to get a ton like he might not even get a single shot right but when they play a bad Squad he's gonna get a hand shots he's probably gonna score right because he's like a pretty accurate shot taker uh and I think he took five shots I mean so he's you know he's really um uh the goal scor was actually pretty was like the edge of like it's actually a pretty bad goal um for who are they playing uh to cons seed uh but it was uh but anyway yeah so I think that he's um impressed I think Morgan Gibbs Rogers has has had been off to a nice Morgan gets white excuse me I got yeah yeah they were playing they were playing wolves and wolves is uh yeah we don't have to talk about them for a few team spur Spurs is kind of interesting to see Spurs at this point of the table where you think that you know maybe they were going to get off to a better start you one one and one four points and their attack just hasn't really gotten off the ground apart from the explosion that they had in gameweek 2 and they fell back to Earth against Newcastle and you saw those same issues that you saw last season with anges system where when it when it kind of starts grinding to a Hal it it it really does and they can't y keep a clean sheet so I I was F just the common sense FPL take here is all that said Pedro porro is the fantasy option and then becomes a do you view Pedro poro as a season keeper and if you do then I think he's just a very logical guy to get whenever it is that is convenient to you if you want to spend more transfers in your defense then I think pedroo you don't necessarily he doesn't feel like a he's compulsory you don't need him right now he's I mean he took so many freaking shots I think he took six shots against Newcastle insane if he's taking that many shots it's clear that anch has said to him put his arm around him and said go for it my man like and he he he owns that sort of space at the corner of the 18 Yard Box he's constantly getting the ball there and he has the he has a great cross and he has the ability to shot uh to to shoot obviously so um I love any fullback that is that attacking uh so that that's I think that to me is even a more take a bigger takeaway than what we thought we'd be talking about Sun salani Madison Etc there's really nothing more to say there yeah I mean and maybe we'll see a better version of their attack when sank is healthy most likely we will but when will that be I don't know I mean and they have the Northland and Derby in game week four which is gonna be really tough obviously um should be interesting match very fun but uh and with no deck rice too uh so yeah well they do have uh their new uh signing uh the the Spanish guy uh who is just like oh he got injured too didn't he I think he's I think he he's like immediately injured so just like who's the guy who came to Arsenal under vanger with a broken back Kim krom yeah exactly he's he's been he's been cmed already he'll be like a new signing when he joins in November though Brandon take us to Chelsea well I actually I'm gonna trade I'll I'll trade uh Chelsea and Fulham okay even though fulham's your Club you tell me uh I want to hear your Co Palmer is like uh wildly inessential uh rant oh okay well yeah I don't I think that that wolves match where Palmer got three assists and a goal really inflated our view and it inflated our view of him in many ways it was a great reminder of how incredible a fantasy asset he was last season of course how does that mean that I'm trying to force this argument that he's not a good as good a fantasy asset as as as everyone seems to think he is des despite him continuing to acrew fantasy points but he did he did all the dirty work against wolves he got one assist and a yellow card uh in the match this weekend and he blanked in the first week and everything that we have and everyone has been saying about Chelsea remains true about this club is it's just in a real moment right now and having of course they're going to be having an identity crisis and I don't think even though moresa style of football is is very attacking I don't think it's enough to bring Chelsea out of that identity crisis so I think I feel better saying saying this today and I've got two weeks to not have to eat my words yeah um I feel better swerving and fading Palmer and taking and and getting picks uh elsewhere with that money I would have spent on him than than to have I do think the wolves match just inflated our sense a great Hot Chip song just turned into a great way to manage your fantasy team uh all right I think that's fair uh and now I will I will now take Fulham because we did our trade here uh trash team trash Stadium trash fans uh no I uh no I'm just kidding no I think no just just joking uh my takeaway is that um I don't know just that Anthony Robinson is uh Jedi is uh is probably the best fantasy has okay actually no I do I have because we talked about him already my other take is that I am maybe slightly I cannot believe I'm saying this slightly interested in Adat tror as a fantasy ASA I never thought I would be there brand that's a place tell me why just because he's everywhere because he scored a goal no because he's like he's all he like he's just getting in the B he's he's been super aggressive like you know he's sort of I don't know what his heat map looks like but it feels like he's just like he he has a lot of the ball and he's like clearly clearly they have decided like like giving him the space to run with the ball is like something that's going to help them I actually not certain it has helped them so far this season but they yeah he's a strange a strange player to be you rarely ever saw him even at wolves like start on the pitch he was always an impact sub and I thought that was going to be his role clearly Marco Silva has said we are a more Dynamic team with him and this is our best starting 11 he's like consistently starting and he's good going forward is he good at much else it's it's really difficult to say uh yeah um but yeah as as like Smith row or uh all these guys are going to be consistent from Smith row to a wobi to aatro so I would I would say if you don't if you hold your nose looking at aobi you should probably hold your nose with trii as well yeah um yeah I think that's I think that's that that's fair I I actually don't think I could actually bring myself to have he's fun to talk about he's fun to watch he's he's he's just a fascinating player in general uh by the way going through this table I'm like I didn't know where anybody was basically outside of the top four this is this is fascinating um so all right so we've we're we're at Club number 13 which is West Ham United gosh you know I really am struggling to come up with a take for West Ham I suppose Jared Bowen is is this season's version of the good fantasy player that is like too expensive on the he's like on the wrong team and he costs too much like it's like he's actually playing pretty well right he's got let's see what he's got so far he's got a yeah I mean I guess it's just a goal and an assist although he's had a couple pretty tough fixtures with with Villa and Man City but uh he's like but I just at 7.5 there's like 25 players in that price range and cheaper who I want more than him right so that's yeah I feel like it could go two ways with West Ham halfway through the season we could be like it's all gone wrong these transfers they made the new managerial app appointment was terrible or it could be like wow they actually did it they had a great summer and I it could genuinely still go either way it feels like I still could see myself getting Su check possibly on my wild card what a what an absolute legend that guy is every just each of the three matches to start the season same old suit check he didn't even start um the match this weekend and he still comes on and you're just like anytime you flip on the West Ham match he's getting a chance he's everywhere it's ridiculous all right let's move on Brandon you're next here um with uh Manchester United Manchester United and 14th geez slower than I realized well I feel I feel Vindicated in my like complete just like a dismay that all these pundits were picking Manchester United to finish even close to the top four it's yeah The Song Remains the Same ten hog is a terrible coach a Terri leader of men and their Midfield is I Mayu cannot a young inexperienced Mayu cannot save this Manchester United midfield they're gonna struggle all season it's a really um it's like yeah and maybe maybe the maybe Mayu garnacho like maybe these guys have like another level they can reach out to they're like they're like a baseball team that has like a bunch of good players but no Allstars you know like outside of uh outside of Bruno obviously and it's like it's really hard to like to make the playoffs or win the World Series when everyone's pretty good no one's amazing you know and it's like and it's like is Zer is you know Zer is he gonna be that guy I don't know you know it's like it feels like every and all of these spots it's like there's no kind of like there's no no one who's making like a best 11 of the top six or whatever right so yeah and I just wonder if it's like and United fans will hate to hear it but I it may be that there were good transfers this summer but you don't have a smart enough person to put them in the right spots and move them around the correct way around the like field I wonder if a new managerial appointment Halfway Around uh halfway through the season helps this team I mean if they stay 14th for much longer it's it's not going to be halfway through the season right it'll happen like this fall um this this Autumn so um yeah I I io's ours uh you I know we get to see his first we get to see his first couple matches I'm kind of excited about that um well you see I don't think he's going to be managing the US this break I don't think they've actually signed the contract is that right I think we're still in terms agreed uh really I'm surprised he didn't get it what he make sure he's got like all the blue M&M's in his pretty much yeah yeah let's take care of that before this weekend we got we gotta like the World Cup's coming up uh all right well let's let's move on to our final handful of clubs here uh Leicester city uh I you know I okay I've got a positive takeaway here which is that they might just have enough like Premier League pedigree like kicking through the kicking through that Squad to stay up this season like they're I I mean it depends on whether they get um an actual like like let's let's leave points penalties out of the out of the equation for the moment right because that might come but but like there's just like a handful of dudes who've it's like I don't know I I just feel like like if you if you compare like the the three promoted teams n have had a a few moments but like just feels like Lester's kind of like I don't know it's like there's enough quality dudes in that Squad that I think they can survive I don't know like what do you what do you think I I think that I am so biased against Steve Cooper why why are you bu why you about I like Steve Cooper like I think he's actually pretty good he's so corny in every every uh like postmatch interview is just platitude after I think you're being Lu I think if he looked like uh no you're you're the one who you're the one whose mind go who's that guy you like who's that guy you like from Twister if he looks like if he looked like Glen if you look like Glenn Powell am I saying this stuff you'd be all you're you're the one whose mind goes to that I um but I don't know I mean they have one point it like L Luton Town was was Raising people's eyebrows at this point I mean luten toown almost survived in all Hony if we keep a fantasy Focus then I mean how about just Jamie vardy right like he might be enough for them I didn't think I didn't think he was going to be uh anything and uh and I mean I'm still not like looking at looking to buy him or anything like that by the way when did they sign I I totally miss that they brought in uh uh Edward did you notice that Edward signed for uh Lester I kind yeah Edward and Jordan IOU so they got a couple of Crystal Palace signes and Bobby Deckard over Reed is in there so they're they're next week's pod we can do a transfer Roundup somewhat desperate transfers there I I mean vout face I think is the best fantasy option on this team right now he's already jumped up to 4.1 based on the setpiece goal that he scored uh but still he he might just be unsexy as he is as a center back the 4.0 Defender to get this James James Justin AER he used to be he used to be M he used to be Mr James Justin is it is what is he priced at James Justin is he 4.0 as well 4.5 yeah see he's properly rated he's properly rated properly rated all right let's move on to uh Crystal Palace BR Crystal Palace 16 Place lower than I expected so is is e too expensive so he has been as noted unlucky he probably should have at least one more goal than he does and he's come close a number of times his finish was really elegant this weekend but is he like what you were saying about Jared Bowen is e is the Allure of e actually an oasis in a desert a mirage I is the Oasis actually a mirage with E and that's my concern with him is you're just paying too much for a guy who's not on a good enough team who sold some very good sturdy Parts over the summer I mean you're not paying that much really I mean you know you're paying 6.9 million now like it's not crazy given how good he is right like I mean he's taking he's taking shots he's taking a lot of shots and creating a lot of chances that does typically translate into FPL results on a long enough time Horizon right and so I I I still think there's something there it's but it has been obviously like a hug disappointing start yeah I mean I guess he got a go and three bonus in the third game we so like I guess we need to stop thinking about him as like a flop right like he's done as well as he's in eok territory where he's been frustrating to own but it's not been a complete dis disaster yep and then yeah you come back to that question of of how many what kind of results are Palace RIT large going to get this season yeah all right IP switch Josh IP switch uh like Leaf Davis like that they have some four million options that we could look at long term um I am not really buying the hype with um with dap like I know he scored in in gameweek three he actually was it in the Liverpool match where he had a pretty big chance in the first half too um but he's just 5.5 million and I just don't know that I would be willing to spend more than 4.5 million in any ipswitch players no disrespect to their supporters but like it's just like it feels like they're going to be struggling all year and I just don't really want to have anybody from a club like that yeah I do love Greaves as their Center back and and our and again our buddy James Holland backed us up there where Greaves looks like he's he's locked that spot down and he looks really strong on set pieces I'm moving I'm moving TBE to Greaves um as we speak then well well done sir all right that brings us to wolves and wolves are in kind of a you're not necessarily in a desperate position ever this early in the season but nothing is really gone their way and Gary O'Neal will be very frustrated they have so many uh to you know go back to your baseball metaphor they have so many great you know uh players who who have the tools the tools but it's just not coming together and then you get no fantasy output uh because of that I think what we have to be looking out for is Will wolves form coincide with the Good Run Of fixtures and we can actually consider some of these relatively decently priced midfielders in forwards from like hang he Chan to and Gomez and and all of those guys yeah but there is some yeah it's like there's there's like some meat on that bone with this team right um but yeah not yet not not yet all right Southampton tell tell me uh how good the Briton Diaz pick was no I'm gonna let you slide on that one I I I gave it to you in the on our deadline aod and that that felt like enough um so uh there is I mean okay here's my real take and I'm sorry in advance but there is nothing to like on this team I can't remember the last time there was a a Premier League team that was that fielded a full 11 had players and I can't find anything to like like we go to Everton who's in 20th in a second I can think of plenty of things right like half I mean there's like eight players on that team that I would consider if like with a new manager and a good run of form right it's like but like with Southampton there's there's like nothing right what about ramsdale coming in at at goal he's already had a price drop so he's 4.4 uh so it's an interesting way to solve a cheap goalkeeper thing that's interesting he's gonna get a ton of saves yeah he is gonna get a ton of saves that's okay that's like half interesting I'll give you that one that's half everything else is zero so instead of a zero to 10 I'll give them a point we're not spit take territory yet but ex I mean do you do you can you count that take at all do you have any like no no um you're usually meaner about Seth anthon than I am I don't know there I it always depresses me when you look at clubs like Southampton where they go through they went through the recent moment where everyone was like this is the model club like they were what Brighton is now Southampton were a decade ago and everyone thought you know they were doing big think pieces on the back room staff and and how they made it all work and brought players through their Academy and and now it's now they're just kind of like I don't know I'd compare them to like Sunderland like a a long a historic club with a great fanbase that has just kind of like all the Allure is is not Apparent at the moment yeah um by the way when I made that IP switch uh def four four million Defender transfer a minute ago it asked me um if I if I wanted to make the change because it would cost me an extra point4 I had not activated my Wild Card even though I had made like 11 transfers over already so wow no granted I'm sure I would have caught it over the next two weeks but still that is a reminder when you play your wild card activate your wild card do not forget to do that do not take a minus 36 or whatever yeah because I made like 11 transfers um so all right well that brings us to uh our final Club here Brandon is that right we're we're down to Everton Club number 20th I said a couple kind of vague but nice things about them a second ago do you have any Everton thoughts Dominick Calbert Luen finally got you know some returns this weekend assist yep uh their defense I is is really kind of the the warning to Fantasy managers is like P past glory is not a promise of future returns pford it's not that pford is the victim of just bad defending pford has been awful as well uh which going back to the ramsdale thing like ramsdale is is in a position to grab that number one shirt from from pford Pigford potentially with the managerial change to England I wonder if that is a big motivating factor but their defense has just been so terrible y it kind of does I I I think it's going to be circumstantial with Everton do the right injuries to her fantasy template happen to where suddenly dominant covert Leen seems like a possible option because right now Everton just seem like a team a story to follow but not participate in yeah I mean a lot like they're there are quality players that keep dropping in price right like so like Michael Leno is at 4.4 million um even bran weight if he you know eventually comes back he's he's he continues to drop in price he's down to 4.9 like he was he was quite good even fantasy-wise he was quite good last season and so like last season they they got to a terrible start they red the ship they had a nice close they were very reliable club for clean sheets down the stretch and so I I think that they could still figure it out right um but they they clearly haven't yet and uh it's just so funny because I mean it's what a difference the final 10 minutes that match uh makes right in terms of how we um how we're thinking about them right now because it's a could be a dice ball his back and just weren't patient enough yeah exactly yeah everything's fine now you know and now it's like is he going to survive the international break it's like an Absol absolute waking nightmare for everybody yeah exactly so all right well that is uh that's your rundown and um I think we're GNA we're going to end it there Brandon so um we have a um uh we have another pod that we'll do next Sunday um where we'll cover um maybe we'll cover some of the international or some of the the transfer window moves too because I um I thought I was following it but you know I missed a bunch of 11th Hour things and so we can update people on that a little bit talk more about wild card we can talk about more game we before for any transfers you know one or more that you're planning to make um and we'll go from there so um yeah so once again if you want to support the podcast we'd sincerely appreciate it go to patreon.com cheating um Brandon do you want to thank

joining us my name is josh happy to be back thank you to pat riley the other pat riley for filling in on last weeks podcast and brandon how are you thank you for asking josh as always im doing great we enjoyed what our friends in the uk would call u a holiday today i think everyone calls it a holiday you mean a bank holiday but i second guess myself like is the bank holiday the same thing as a holiday lets try not to get into it i needed a bit of a i needed a bit of a breather admittedly josh from the events of sunday i think both you and i were riding pretty high with the game week game week three going into sunday well get into it liverpool is a bit of a thorn in our sid didnt enjoy increasing your rank by 35 times in the the final match of the game we before a two we break i dont want to winge too much because the fact that one match did change the rank so much just shows early season blah were all still very tight things will change come game week four but what we need to figure out here josh is whats the plan like if those who dont have salah whats the plan those who dont have holland whats the plan those who dont have i dont know brian and buo do we need a plan there yep i dont know about him bomo the other the other two i talked about it a little bit i have not shouted this out yet but just as a heads up because i dont want to like get into too much we promote enough stuff brandon including our own stuff on here but i did start a substack for always cheating a couple of weeks ago called the fpl scouting notebook of course were not planting the many great newsletters that are out there brandon but this is just quick thoughts from every match right so i did this afternoon im enjoying these i spent like a good two hours this afternoon theyre great theyre honestly great when you had this idea you pitched it to me and you were inspired by some nfl fantasy content that you were consuming yep where is the very short brief quippy digestible fun email that you can just read with your morning coffee after the game week is over so just a good compliment to the pod thank well thank you and its been theyre been fun to do i was worried i was going to fade after like one but after three i still feel i still feel good lets see how i feel when im 69m overall but so far i was technically on a green era by the way this week shockingly i was up like it was one of those like 15000 green eras but ill take it so the substack though is just always cheating subcom e easy enough so just always cheating subcom subscribe of course brandon and but lets get back to fantasy proper i it was its one of those weeks where if you had flipped the fixtures id be feeling great right now right as you said its like the timing is a big factor here right if we had ended with the man like if man city at west ham had been the final match of the gw you and i would be over the moon right about this this miracle green arrow i be id be talking instead of i just got a green like i nicked a green arrow it would be i cannot believe i got a green arrow after this weekend right so its its all about how you how you look at it for me we were were separated what like by one point and last week maybe separated by 5 to 10 points im on a distinct red arrow like i went from 540k to just the wrong side of a million so its strange but i was honestly a little a little flabbergasted at that salid what wrong can you can you share your team with me so i can take a take a look here im curious sure ill bring where did it all where did it all go wrong i want to i want to know so you can see here i started game week one 21 mil and now were at one point not one mil points are 70 points game we rank of 4m it went wrong in all of the like like marginal characters morgan rogers is probably the biggest person to blame here because he and jia pedro were my two transfers i dropped the injured salanki for jaia pedro and thought well this is a uniquely difficult fixture for brighton going to the emirates i and it looked like brighton were going to be held until the declan rice red card y but that was a very nice goal by brighton ultimately interesting write ups in the athletic about how arsenals defense was a perhaps a little shambolic prior to the red card but i did feel like this goal was coming and until they got gonna have chances right i me even man city man city have been conceding coned multiple goals for the season but the other teams always going to have chances so its you can kind its like its easy to like rewrite the narrative but it is it is rare to trans because you brought in pedro and then you put him first on your bench which i assume was a like a price change thing right i think he was set to rise and then you assumed that salanki was set to fall he has still not fallen once salani was locked because of injury who bloody knows sure and i i did bring j pedro in largely because of both salani p perhaps going down and pedro going up and then morgan rogers because i started him i thought he i was impressed by his performance against arsenal and i thought surely he would get a return against lester and aston villa just even though theyre its its onas team at this point he looks so strong in the midfield its interesting because theyre the theyre the same price and morgan rogers is the number 10 and anana is ostensibly like a box to box he is doing what my goodness why am i get his name the player who was their box tobox player last season who was nam douglas lise douglas lise thank you and may be that about unai emory system that just lends itself to a little bit of freedom from these deep line players or its just fluky but it does feel a little unusual that you would go from this deep line player that was a great fantasy quite because he luis was a pretty good fantasy asset last season and for onana to be in the boat now and its like but still i dont think i would recommend an nana transfer his first goal came from a set piece so that one is like not a necessarily would you qualify as an open play goal sure but i am i am a little bummed about how i set up my team going into this weekend but you see the logic anthony gordon has been a differential for me and he got his goal last week which was very useful and now hes traded with esi and the problem is esok is owned by a much larger percentage of fantasy managers and then guys like smith row and cona very quiet diego jot the liverpool player that the one liverpool player that you and i both own was the was the guy to not have this particular game week i okay so i was feeling very heres the heres the silver lining i was feeling very bad about dean henderson after game week two and i was already teetering and saying i want a premium goalkeeper four points from dean henderson feels like he got a 10pointer and hes got a nice home fixture coming up in game wi four so ive gone from maybe strategizing changing my goalkeeper you get this is my editorial comment here is that i think you just get you get too worked up about goalkeepers and its like its a real like dont sweat the small stuff thing to me because its just very hard to get it right the difference between a expensive goalkeeper and a in a in a in a mediocre goalkeeper is marginal in terms of the total point like maybe in a particular run of fixtures you want the better keeper but even though theres theres theres reasons why right that weve talked about many times before why you dont want the more expensive keeper right like lets say you get david rya well what happens if arsenal have an incredible run of attacking fixtures which they do in like seven or eight weeks youre going to want to have one of those arsenal defenders right because theyre great at theyre theyre great at hoovering up bonus points and matches where they keep clean sheets sleep in particular gabriels good on set pieces ben white gets tag returns but then you probably are going to want to have two arsenal attackers as well right and so and so suddenly you have this keeper who probably has a slightly better chance of keeping a clean sheet than a 45m keeper but youve gobbled up one of your arsenal spots right now that cant be a double up in the midfield or hts or whatever and he also was almost never going to get bonus points during the good fixtures right because theyre going to keep clean sheets and theyre going to be fournil wins like that right and even if you just like look at like just sheer like clean sheet odd percentages right its like a team that is heavily favored to keep a clean sheet in a match and you look at like the vegas odds or whatever and its like theyre maybe 50 at absolute best to keep a clean sheet right and the team that you think is going to get smoked is like 40 right so the difference is pretty low so i didnt mean to go on a little micro rant there i just think like i i think henderson is a perfectly viable goalkeeper for the premium goalkeeper i think the interesting one would be allison and that becomes a discussion of where youre at with your budget and trent and because trent is remarkably more expensive than any of these guys and i think then allison becomes an interesting points grabber for all those clean cheats and possibly covering your rivals who do have tr but anyway i dont totally disagree with you and now that the vibes have shifted it was the great goalkeeper vibe shift in game we 3 for me and im feeling just fine with dean henderson what about you lets lets throw your team up on the screen so well theres some big news which is that i have activated my wild card that happened a couple of hours ago i i just was looking at everything that was happening looking at price changes looking at my squad looking at who i wanted and i was like this is going to be so exhausting to like to get there through normal transfers right its its like its such a mess and im gonna get crushed on team value which happened to me last season and it drove me absolutely crazy at the end of the year which and honestly part of it was just me being a little disengaged i think early on in the season last year and i was i was to this is i think a real a real problem and i you probably if youre as disengaged as i was feeling last year youre probably not even listening to this pod right now because its hard to part of the problem is that when you get like i was off to a bad start i both of us were last season and i was like screw this like i felt like i just was like a little like whats the word i dont know just salty about it right and i think like the problem then is that you dont you like get away from pl strategically right because youre like im just i dont want to think about fpl for like its international break is here im going to go 11 days without thinking about fpl right youre not a high performance manager at that point exactly and so in a window like that you might be a 0 56 pr like every option that might have been available to you in wild card is now done right and so i was just thinking about it i was like well i have to decide like before we do this podcast if i going to do it or not okay because i because it was just like i dont even have like pedro the way you do right and so and so i started tinkering a little bit and i was like i just i think i like this team quite a bit better and because you can s save five transfers i dont see as much i dont see as much of a rationale for like waiting for like a rainy day to play my wild card right it was like im just going to wild card and be slightly aggressive although i wouldnt say that im wild carding from like a position of great strength im like 984 th000 overall im doing fine right like its its not like a bad start but like i just dont look at my squad and think like im gonna crush it these next few weeks right i what i look at and think my god how much more how much further down am i gonna go over the next three weeks before i can fix it with transfers right and so i think that was what motivated me to go ahead and play the wild card but just before we do that ill share my screen with you and again i know were sharing screens and we do this is still a podcast this is a an audio medium and so i dont want anyone to think that but i think just in general its just that you and i can look at this together right while were of course while were while were talking about it and ill just try to be conscious that i dont make reference to video stuff that that people who are listening cant see so but 77 points in the game week it was i thought like again i f if solid doesnt absolutely go off then im feeling pretty good about this game week right i was going into that liverpool match i was around 300k overall and feeling feeling pretty solid about pushing on and i think after that match i think the interesting thing is joda who you mentioned already and what we should do there its a question i havent fully resolved yet because i dont i dont know the best i dont know what the answer is with him like i think hes fine i think hes a good asset its its like the fact that david louise has been out scoring him the last two weeks like i still feel like joda is the preferred option of the two 75m liverpool midfielders do you feel like l david louiz is or douglas gez too many lou diaz do you think you feel like luis diaz has now supplanted joda as the preferred second midfields option on liverpool well if you just take the fpl points yes but how can we then you put yourself into this position of trying to predict the future do we think that doo jota has had particularly bad matches the last two matches no do i think that the team functions better without j jota in the starting 11 100 not so it then it becomes a very difficult question of how long of a view do i want to take how patient do i have to be to get the value that i need out of diogo jot and thats just a harder question to answer i dont feel like if youre if youre thinking i just want to spend one free transfer over the international break jota to lis diaz doesnt feel like a worthwhile transfer to me not at all if not a step backwards right it almost feels its a little bit its not quite the same because not as extreme but its a little bit like the morgan rogers onana situation right its like looking at what weve seen so far youd think maybe onana is the guy right but then if you look at it more rationally and you just look at like positioning and right like shots and youre like i you still feel like you want i think joda and you want morgan rogers of if you had to pick two of those four so but i think i think its tricky and so i unfortunately i think what bumed me out a little bit my my transfer are both bust i brought in concept and smith row i think honestly this is why i have decided to wild card by the way too is i just i just made too many mistakes in my in my gw one draft and i just cant quite solve them all through transfers and i have lewis hall who set to drop in price tonight well see if it happens right the price changes have been a little unpredictable but hall set to drop in price i havent even had a chance to move him yet right because i had to move k quansa i had to move anduku those are the the biggest ones but even like sun like i feel a little caught out right now with sun i got a great return from him game week to but at the moment it feels like i have the fourth best of the expensive midfielders i have the fourth best one right and so that feels like another issue that i want to solve but i and if i could just go from like sun to palmer or whatever or even just get solo with like two transfers i i might have considered just doing that even if i had to burn four possibly but its the fact that i have to fix all these other issues still right that make it that make it tricky and so even harwood bellis even a pre 60 minutes not that anyones gonna lose sleep over your like last guy totally may maybe harwood bellis too exactly so well youre were going to say something about flicking youve got beef with flein now ah hes trash whole defense is trash i dont know im sure itll im sure when gw 38 rolls around flein will be the third highest rated keeper on the season and i will miss out on every amazing return of his im sure thats true but i dont i dont i like this brighton team brandon i want to continue liking this brighton team im not positive i can like this brighton team if i have right brenford both but maybe hell trans like them all maybe hell move in january to brighten who knows right so so im referring to b no branford i want to continue enjoying watching this brenford team play and i cant right now because i am im stricken with anxiety over when fleckin is going to concede a goal and it seems to come later and later each week and so and so i just want i want this trash out of my team i like brenford long term i think its around gw seven maybe when they have a when they started a nice run of fixtures and i think johan wisa is somebody that we havent talked about too much but with ivan tony you officially is it did he go to saudi arabia wherever he went i havent seen any news yet no i think that transfer happened on deadline day so with tony gone and the forward they signed injured until like the end of december yoan wi has its its his spot right and hes hes a six million forward who is like i dont hes not like the most he doesnt blow you away when you watch him in these matches but its like its a competent team right its like a well coached wellmanaged team like if you had to pick between mooney and vissa for example like maybe its a bad example because vissa already has a couple goals in the season but theres just something about like i just feel a little more confident that like that were going to get some something more out of out of visa right like you like looking five 10 weeks ahead i like that ando and visa together theyre like a great duo and thats they theyre like just one of those lowkey fantasy duos where youre like well you could get either one depending on your budget and your team set up and you probably get the share of some spoils from whatever goals that brenford are going to score exactly right and thats and emomo is a little harder to get because hes 7m maybe maybe e turns into emomo at some point for some managers right like theres a thats an easy sideways move so those are those are some things that ive been kick i dont have visa in my my squad right now they have a couple tough fixtures coming up so i think hes hes like he works a little better as a later transfer but i will share with you brandon this is like a first a first draft of a of a wild card team so take it with a a big grain of salt i i dont i have not firmed up where what im thinking here i think the goalkeeper spot is the first question for me and if you were making a goalkeeper transfer this week or youre wild carding i think that kappa and like and im like firmly in the like i wish i could just like roll out i would rather take an extra four million and just get a zero every week right like if that were possible like i just coldkeepers are so worthless in this game i feel like and so its coming down to kea and dean henderson for me as my as my goalkeeper pick and okay i dont know im i thought kea had kea had a nice performance in his opening match they did concede a couple of goals but i dont know i feel like he might be hes hes a talented keeper i dont know youre stretching youre stretching well listen you find me a keeper that you want right now yes if you include allison then yes but right like in the sub bracket find one that like gets you excited sure theres theres no way to win or lose this conversation youre going from flecking to flecken and that and that and thats fine on a wild card you have that luxury get whatever flecken you want born the fixtures coming up theyre home hosting chelsea followed by liverpool then its a good coupling with southampton and leester and then the fixtures are diabolical starting in game week 8 city its its true tricky it is the question is whether you should even look like you want to look in the medium term right but like i think the problem is if you look at it through a i was thinking about that i was like well which like cheap keeper has already gotten a couple of tricky matches out of the way and unfortunately that might lead me back to flecken which like that would be depressing if i like wild card had flecken out and then wild card him back in days quite an incredible story you just wild carded the same team you had in gw one just go can you im you just went straight back no i think i might end up with dean henderson though i do feel better about it now that gayi stayed right i think that and they did they did make a center back signing as well and so i think i think theyre okay im still amazed that they let anderson go i felt like he was good for them last season i dont get it either good has he started yet for fulam i probably started in the efl cup match and at that point i thought he was like a dead certain to like start every other fulham game from here to eternity and he did not start over the weekend it was depp and bie again so well see ultimately hes destined for the starting 11 its just a matter when i feel like you wouldnt they and they must have given him some assurance right like you wouldnt he wouldnt leave a starting spot at palace to be a backup hes captaincy material like as soon as soon as karney gives that up fpl captaincy right because youve been youve been captaining youve been captaining tom kerney in fpl for the first three weeks you call me captain carney and thats that ill never change ill never change i refuse so so my backline is keeping robinson of course i think he is absolutely fantastic and it just like hes turned into such a like amazing fantasy asset because hes now getting attacking returns consistently enough that even when they concede he is hes valuable right hes got two assists and two bonus in the season and i feel good about him at 45 i think kana is another one where its unfortunate that they conceded to lester a little late in that one as well but i feel i feel good about him too right its just a cheap way into a competent defense lewis dunk i think is another one where its hes 45 and again talk about a like captaincy captain center back player right hes just like a super reliable solid can nick a couple of headed goals every season type option so its its a pretty cheap back line and then ive got celba as my one expensive defender the one question for me is whether theres any shortterm value in moving celba to van djk for a couple of weeks possibly moving back to sba at some point but at the moment my plan is just is just to roll with cba and save my transfer and then ive gone with axel tonbe as my as my four million defender you pick its its like its like the goalkeeper thing right you pick you pick a four million guy theyre all terrible just dont spend more than four million right right and and i dont know like there are like moments when brighton seem saucy and fun and youre like well maybe theres like a match where they just everyone get it switch feels saucy totally why do i keep saying brighton i got brighton on the brain youre im counting two brighton players in this team so and thats thats more brighton players than you often see so youre definitely thinking about it our friend james holland who came on the patreon pod whos a been a long time i switch season ticket holder fan is hes he told us he picked i switch to optimistic as he is to finish 15th in the table youd think theres some points that have to be coming for this team sooner or later they picked up a point against fulham for instance and leaf davis the le leaf legend we need some little nickname for him leaf legend though picks up i think he got an assist and two bonus in this match so he is he is off and its god if he was four million hed be like one of the most players in fantasy but at 45 its just a little too much a little too much switch for my blood brandon but at 4m lets lets lets lets toss one of their options on the bench through the midfield the big thing here is i have palmer and solo so am i chasing points i dont know im probably getting like the second and third best fantasy access in the game so i dont feel like that bad about it and part of what i like about it is i feel like theres a version of this like i feel like theres a rotatable like a rotating third forward that i can use here as well and so i it almost feels like ive got a little too much money in my midfield still but at the moment ive got smith row who im holding on to maybe i shouldnt be i i thought he was just like i dont know he was out of it in that if switch m i he had a couple chances like right before he got subbed right like and that was i think i think what youre seeing with smith row is just a young man who has played his entire life at arsenal at one club and as talented as he is going to a new club across town its its not easy especially for the younger players and hes being a lot is expected of him like hes coming now into fulham and they expect him to be like the general of that attack its going to take time i think and i agree like he looks a little you hes not there yet hes not finished and so he might turn into morgan rogers which would save me like 045 that probably that probably is the sensible move right honestly i could get onana if i wanted but i still feel like i feel like rogers is still is still probably the more sensible pick there it would also make a for a little bit less of a benching headache i just feel like its always tricky when youve got when youve got eight midfield starters right that you want to play like or when youve got three forwards and five midfield ers all of whom are competing and every single week youre i dont like having that headache in fantasy right let me ask you this about this draft and we talked a lot about fifth midfielder before gw one and i ended up with a 55 bron diaz is my fifth mid youve thought about this a little bit youve gotten off harry winks you now have your fifth attacker would u be sano or smith row at 55 where are you at with the 45 guys like morgan rogers is as low as you think you can go given what weve seen so far no i i think so just because i do think that like you get quite a lot from him at five i think hes 51 now right you get quite a lot from him at 51 is that worth the extra 05m or point6 or whatever probably is honestly and i think what makes it and so just to quickly go through my midfield right now ive got salah palmer e sano and smith row and sano to me is just correcting a mistake akake and it was the impetus for the wild not i shouldnt say the impetus but one of the reasons i was convinced we can call the empatis of salwa this sal thats right salo is absolutely 100 the impetus even cole palmer is like a luxury move that you can do when youre wild carding right but the what was seano not having risen in price even once is shocking considering that like in every in every like way that you look at him i feel like hes been fantastic like he the underline stats are good the actual fpl stats are good and he looks awesome right even if youre just watching highlights of these matches like seano is heavily involved right like he looks like hes even even with salanki out hes gonna take on a lot of attacking you a lot of the attacking potential and so hes just like a i think for most managers a square peg for any problematic round hole that we have so joe pedro is super cheap for the third forward at 5 5 morgan rogers is as we discussed like probably the cheapest fifth mid youd want and sano is hes 55 right so yep its rare that people are paying enough attention to bourne myth and have a 55 hole they need to fill unless youre in a situation like this where i just did it last week i got i got smith row over smania but like i think but if youre trying to get an expensive if youre trying to fit three premiums into your squad youre going to need to fill it out with some of these cheapies right and i think the problem then is you dont necessarily have players you want to start every single week right and i think thats where to get back to your question about the more expensive bench option right i think thats where the having a more expensive player makes more sense because you can talk like you can you can rotate them a little bit and so so then my forward line and this to me is the problem is is it a problem you tell me right and so the problem is that i have i have holland hollands not going anywhere and and i just dont care i dont i dont like any version of my squad that doesnt have him in it i dont care how much how many other spots i can upgrade okay like maybe im missing whos talking about getting rid of holland at this point well just a lot of people are like theres like the advanced stats folks are like dropping him in the short ter i dont know probably not before the brenford match but maybe ahead of game with i dont i dont want to get into it because my goal this season is not you and i are not going to no flame wars this year brandon were on were on a firmly on were were just this is a friendly world were not gna get our were not gonna stick our foot in the were the swit of fpl exactly were an island onto ourselves and so what i have is i i have holland i have jaa pedro who i honestly to me thats another mistake that im correcting i just i should have been on him from well i its i dont know i i dont need to kick myself too much because the player that i got was chris wood and chris woods been excellent and in all three of the matches including gw two where he blanked he was good and im sure a lot of people out there have not watched like any forest so far this season but hes been great and hes hes in this last match he i think he took five shots in the match scored a goal had a brace late that got chocked off played the full 90 minutes i think there was some risk like earlier about whether he was gonna be rotating a little bit but hes hes been i think hes been absolutely fantastic so far this season and so my feeling with him now is maybe i just keep him and i just and i just rotate him a little bit and that hes probably solid enough that you dont necessarily need to move him for one of these other options that have been a little inconsistent and so the problem though is theres no wally watkins in this squad theres no theres no eso right like theres a number of players that that i cant have and thats just the price you pay if youre going to have holland salah and palmer right thats a thats almost what is that 27 its almost 40m of my 60m budget in three players its absolutely insane right the gamble youre making here which is i think why youre making it is its one of the bet better bets you could place is youre youre taking cole palmer over a second striker youve got two third tier strikers and cole palmer i think thats i think thats exactly right and and also banking that like these 55m guys or what ill just use starting prices here right but the 55m guys sano smith row pedro morgan rogers you pick the three or four options there that those players can be good enough right that they can get you to like a 65 is option be best as ivanka trump would say i dont know what that i have no idea what thats reference to but so thats thats where i am and so that was unexpect i i thought i would drop that on you brand you didnt know i was going to reveal i had no idea and then you showed us a draft i thought you were going to tease it for next week we got a whole international break to work through but still youre going to see a whole different draft when you turn tune in to always dream next monday very likely exactly and and honestly i will say to and not to do a second shout out for the substack but part of the value of doing this is i have been watching match highlights of everything that i missed over the weekend and you do like you do like you dont have to be ready to subsec do this but like if youre if youre like taking fantasy seriously you should be watching highlights you dont have to like they always whatever im sure im sure you can watch them in any country youre in right but in like nbc and peacock they have the extended highlights and right and sometimes you look at them and you like h like this is like 13 and a half minutes i dont have this much time but for whatever reason they decide to spend four and a half minutes on the lineups at the start of every one of these and then they show you like the opening minute of the match right so all you have to do is you pull up the extended highlight you skip forward about 3 minutes and 40 seconds and then youre where you want to be so youre watching like a f minute highlight package and i think it is a quick way to be like wow like morgan rogers is one of these players who like if you just looked at his returns youre like ah like three straight blanks i think especially in those first two matches you saw somebody who was involved right in the villain this is why you brought him in but like had a game week three but you just you see things that you dont necessarily see if youre just looking if youre just watching the featured matches and and then looking at fpl results right points well ill be ill be jealous of you having mosala going into game week four i my current plan is i have to roll unless i want to take a hit to get mo which i dont think i do i think ultimately what i need is two free transfers to get gordon and jot out and salah for a fifth mid any chance that you would wild card yourself have i talked you into it a little bit if i play well i dont look at my team and say i see problems when i look at my team but no not im not feeling the stress that you clearly and youre not necessarily feeling the stress i understand youre like you just feel like this is the best strategy for you and i get that what i would say is im feeling very engaged with the game right now like feel like like im im feeling good about like my ability to make confident decisions right and just like trust my instincts a little bit and so thats that was what is what has pushed me to do it right just feeling like lets go for it lets lets try clearly a lot of our listeners are thinking either wild card or the price market is like in full swing right now and going into the international break usually theres a lot of action at the start of the international bre especially the first one when people are like re reine tuning their team and then the market should probably slow down in a few days and you can chill out and take a step back for the middle part of the international break but a couple questions here one from stepen cus who has thoughts on early transfers to navigate price rises price falls earlier in the season and during international breaks and john reynolds has said nobody ever should i use all three of my free transfers during this break so i think from your perspective josh you are seeing these price changes and are thinking thats going to be something youre going to feel the effects of later in the season so and you agree with this right i think of you as somebody whos very like conscious of price changes and like the market and i think its fun to take advantage of it at this point joe pedro is a great example of this where hes going youre going to make money off of this guy over the break and you dont you dont have to bring in these players thinking im a im a 100 believer in jaia pedro you could turn just being a two to three week believer in jaia pedro is going to mean you can make a better financial decision with your team later on in the season and especially when youre looking at that late season wild card the more money you have the better so i am for like playing the price market earlier in the season the trick with early transfers in the international break is lord knows whats going to happen to these guys when they go off to their international teams i think im like more compelled to go for guys in the fpl transfer market who maybe dont have an international call up thats true i theyre not traveling and all that thing and its like situational too right like i feel like if you have like a decent bench like if your bench is decim ated right and like if one more player gets injured then you are absolutely going to have to like and you use like you use your transfer early and like your team is 11 strong right and like one injur is going to kill you then maybe dont use the transfer early but if you have like a little bit of bench dep then i think its fine to go ahead and do it i dont know i dont think like its i dont think we get that many we dont get as many international break injuries as we think we do right its a bit like holiday rotation right this idea that like youve got to go 15 deep on your in your squad for the for the holidays right because theres so much rotation during you december and then you look and youre like everybody played every match its like maybe pep like outside of like man city though youre probably pretty safe well i feel like weve already given a pretty good gift to our listeners there with the wild card talk but we do have a bonanza coming up after a short housekeeping break here where were going to go through all 20 clubs and just give what were going to call josh common sense thats right takes and i like this sensible people did or do we

link for your chance to get those 500 gift cards all right josh now it is time to do our common sense fantasy takes i think you expressing this through your wild card are saying 3 weeks is this were at this pivot point where now weve got like critical mass with data information grass test data test we now have real like takes to get us to the next step in the season and i think the real goal here is to do what i think i think especially because were were we have we have two weeks right to do some thinking ahead of ahead of gw four and so theres its a chance for us to like take a step back and sometimes again i talk about like the forest from the trees and i think i got caught up in this thinking last season which was i was letting other people take the temperature of the season right and like when it came to transfers or went to wild card do all this stuff i was relying way too much on what other people were saying right and it was because i felt like i didnt have my own rules of thumb about each squad right heuristics if you will brand if i didnt have these 20 heuristics that were about to that be a great that make sure that no one listened to this episode great keyword just became a great title for the podcast episode so and again weve already like were like 50 minutes in already but were going to do these are going to be like one lightning round big picture thought for all 20 clubs okay so just like quick thought and this were going to keep this fantasy focused right but like but just one oo the lady round is on so lets get going here let me just going to sitp for my i have a rare that i pod with a cpe glass brand we have a comment in the in the chat from our friend pat who was on last week he says youre sipping on a fancy glass you can check us out on screen on our youtube page but what you get so you got what you got my wife my wife turned in the final draft of her book to her publisher and so we were you played tiny part in that as well brandon you got a got my fingers and everything i fingers in that so not getting it published but just in the actual design so were just supporting the real talented people in our lives thats what we do were celebrating tonight so thats thats amazing all right so thats im extra spicy this evening so lets go into it i think i think the more interesting way to do this maybe i was going back and forth i was like should it be alphabetical should it be table order and ive decided that table order is the way to go because ultimately the teams at the top of the table are the ones that fantasy managers are tend to be more focused on and so i think it makes sense to start there and so were just going to go one through 20 and and talk about these clubs and then and again were g to keep it fantasy focused and then next week well do more of a proper game week four preview but theres no point in doing that ahead of a whole week of international travel and fixtures and things like that right because therell be some therell be some breaking news half the half the league might move to fenerbache brandon in the next handful of days right so we just we just dont know by the way i saw a picture of jaden sancho on the pitch on sunday and i was like i somehow just completely missed that he moved i and i know i knew there was like rumors about him moving but him moving to chelsea i started laughing when i saw it because i was like what is hes like the ninth like i dont know whatever i we dont need to get into that do we that could be our an ear our thats thats thats a hard pass too much oxygen has been devoted to the chelsea youre right youre right youre right youre right what i what i think is interesting about it is man utd came up with nothing because for a while there was going to be a swap with raheem sterling raheem sterling ends up at arsenal and man utd like heres who did they get they didnt get anybody theyre still playing marcus rashford so thats very fun for them mason mounts injured now too right so its like so all so lets start at the top of the table here heres my first thought on mince maybe well go like back and forth how about that i do one you okay and then if you have an extra you have an extra thought we can we can add it but my first thought on man city to kick things off here and first overall at the moment tied with liverpool on nine points theyre head theyre head on go different theyre tied on goal difference but theyve scored two more goals my first thought of man city is that the defense probably needs to be reevaluated and like we probably my thought is that we shouldnt be drawing any real conclusions about their defense at the moment because the like rod has they just havent had roder for the first three weeks and he is he though not a defender himself is incredibly important to the defense and not only is he not there to protect the defense but i also wonder if it has forced them to play gardial as a as a center back right like i wonder if pep has not had the confidence to like let him push forward more right as a result of not having rodri in the center because i feel like we saw a more attacking leftwing version of him in the past and hes hes been pretty pinned i feel like to the to the back line that is interesting i feel like guardi its its just more of i think its less about the form in the tactics and more gardial might just be a slow starter we saw this with him at the start of last season and city just seemed to find that like that destruction rhythm midway through there theyre are oneman fantasy team right now and the pleasure and maybe when foden is i dont know but at the moment its youre right its its a oneman team and so theres theres not like the problem is theres no value anywhere else right its not like its not like theres a 45m defender in there there is and rico lewis but i dont necessarily trust him with rod coming back right to be a consistent starter right because rico lewiss great cool fantasy value is that inverted fullback thing that he does and now walker finally got on the pitch in gw three so thats just like a firm wait and see so for liverpool then its like i think the common sense take here is its the complete opposite of man city and that liverpool are the man city of this season as far as fantasy where youre like how am i going to fit all of the guys who i want into my team and you would want for me on a midfielder they dont have any forwards so you dont have to worry about that but whats fascinating about this new season with liverpool is i think i was able to talk myself into not having mosal game week one because i thought arnie slots coming in who knows what the level of discontent or discom population is going to be and what we have seen is whether its to do with slot or whether it is just these players being veteran winners is this liverpool team looks like they want to send this version of liverpool off into the sunset on a real high from van djk to salah and everyone in between theyre just like in some incredible form and i think going to be dealing with liverpool assets all season for the good like so get as many liverpool assets as you can a pronto and thats the other issue with my wild card is i only have one at the moment and salah its hard to get even more than one in if youre g to go expensive it may be that cole palmer just cant fit that would thats the only that if i did that i could i could still have joda and trent like thats interesting does like a 45m defender and cole palmer is that worse than joda and trent like its a interesting question well spoiler alert for whatever were going to say about chelsea but i do think that its much its overstated with cole palmer right now i do not think that he is necessary for a fantasy team thats doubled with salah and holland okay i think hes and its like i love i have nothing bad to say about the player and the fantasy its the price the price is illogical if youre going for holland plus salah and i see no way around that and that might be me just playing as a template manager but i just think its its true its facts no i think its true i think the part of my thinking there was i could maybe do a little back and forth with him and saka right like like follow like following the fixtures a little bit this feels like i dont think ive ever heard you talk about swap in swap hoke pokei i think were we always you and i dont like to say it because its hokey pokei in america its hokey kokei in the uk were very aggressive and were very finger pointing centric here in here in the us we poke people exactly we hoke and we poke we also hoke people we do both so i think its you might you might be hon again this is exactly why this exercise is useful right because when you look at in a big picture sense youre like yes what do i think about liverpool what i think about them is that i want three of their assets right and so that is thats very interesting so thats thats something for me to think about a little bit that would also enable me to maybe get ali watkins or dare i say nico jackson but lets lets lets lets put a button in that for a second lets go on to brighton and hve alby and brandon theres a lot to say here we talked about pedro already i think mina is an interesting talk about another 55m player i think hes playing super well hes the the right winger for for brighton and finally picked up an assist it was one of those like rebound assist but he honestly could have scored on the chance right and so he was well in and so i think i think the mina is a good you mean like im not like first name on the wild card level right but i just think hes like i think hes he looks good i think the whole team i just like i just admire brighton so much like i admire like every like the way that they do business while still seeing competitive is super impressive to me like its theyre theyre like they should be like the envy of every like non top cl and they make hiring new managers look easier than like most other teams in europe herler is like hit the ground running he looks great looks confident the team looks great and im with you on mta is like moma on the right hand side but for cheaper so i think thats a great budget call i think m be 65 or seven and mint is 55 so not as not as like polished maybe as yes correct yes i would agree with that matoma pro price rose up to 66 so theres a 11 one savings there big difference then huge all right so were on to arsenal now aral the take here is i the take is it changes week to week after gw one i thought the only player anybody needed in their squads was kai hyberts after gw two i thought the only player anybody needed in their squad was bai osaka after game after gw or rya for that matter arsenal are simil so like i was saying with liverpool get them all arsenal is like pray that youre lucky week to week that you have the guy who gets the points and that goes for their defenders as well is gabrielle finally gonna get his corner kick goal this match who knows so arsenal i think have presented decent enough value but they appear like theyre going to be a frustrating team to buy into fantasy wise because you can always justify having them and they might not pay you back the way these like surefire bets from liverpool and erling holl might what do you think about saka like three returns in three but its like it doesnt its like he feels like he just feels like such a step below palmer salah and and and holland as like as like the like its like a premium asset i disagree in that i think saka will outscore for palmer this season i think hes a better pick than palmer okay all right im excited to get to our palmer section then i want i want i want to see what you have to say there but lets move on to but just like just real quick on saka i dont totally disagree with you on the skepticism there because the question remains saka ceiling is its fuzzy i dont want i dont know what it is so thats the red flag for exactly because its hes super consistent and thats its hugely valuable but its like if you look at like a luis diaz and i know small sample etc eta we always have to say that but like if you look at like what diaz or joda have done in the first like three weeks for example right its like theyre not necessarily as consistent but they are like because theyre a little more explosive in terms of their returns it averages out to the same right especially when you factor in the three million price difference between them right so i dont know theres theres theres something to think about there all right lets move on to newcastle my thought on newcastle is im impressed that theyre in fifth like it feels like feel like they shouldnt like theyve had three pretty underwhelming performances to start the season they locked into a win versus spurs they were under the c by spurs for a good deal of that match but you do i do tip my hat to newcastle for grinding out thats a how you have to do it some weeks y i feel maybe a little bit more optimistic like there are like green shoots for newcastle and i think i think we will see much better from them maybe the international break will be rejuvenating just out of curiosity at newcastles fixtures coming up its wolves away in game we four followed by fulham city everton brighton its not like a great run to be honest mix bag so i think ill be ready to get rid of gordon for sure coming going into game week five and that will hopefully work into my solem move that makes that makes sense so not a lot maybe its just theres not we dont have a lot positive to say because we started out this season i started the season with two newcastle i wanted to have three and i had to move out of gordon at the last minute for i almost did nick poop is exactly so its like but theyre theyre putting together some u i dont know they just its it has not been inspir like you said maybe the fact they havent played inspired and there theyre still seven from nine is says something all right so that we move now to this ones pretty easy its its exactly what we said at the top of the show ivan tony is officially out of the mix therefore you are free to get momo and visa and thats all you need to know their pictures are bad coming up so this is something you can put a pin in and come back to but thats those are the thats the real deal thats the news but they and they and they do get better right because i was i was looking earlier and they are i think its and by the way and bomo is now up to fifth overall in points for midfielders like he is he is doing quite well and were we probably have to like start taking him more seriously as a as a buy but once you get past city away spurs away in four and five its a nice run they have three home fixtures in four one of those home fixures zip switch at home fulham bournemouth everton lester especially if youre if youre targeting in those like visa right theres a its a nice nice run and theres there i think that could be interesting so all right so lets move on to aston villa we did talk about we we talked about onana and rogers a fair amount already so weve already done our villa section think about the defense on villa because thats emory his calling card has been defense typically so what its four goals conceded you should be able to freeze the the top of the table here like kind like an excel so that i could see but i what is it four goals for four goals against then for them i just dont see it as a problem long term right the personnel hasnt changed they have lost douglas louise but i just have a lot of respect for emory as a manager right i just think hes gonna sort it out they still have emy martinez and so i think its just fluky right like they absolutely could have kept a clean sheet in that lester game right it was like they lester had one chance and that was the one they scored on and so just happened to fall to the goat exactly so okay so i think the frustrating thing for villa is they just havent become as fantasy relevant as we expected them to be and by the time they might be ready then champions league will begin totally and itll be the added layer of anxiety of whats gonna whats watkins minutes he still going to be a 65 minute sub yep exactly its hard to say and with duran playing so well right i think thats it complicates things because you dont need watkins to play the full 90 every match i you have seen a good amount of squad depth at villa at the start of this season so thats at least encouraging in terms of what how maybe emory wont have to rotate the starting 11 so much its just that hes just going to have the limit guys minutes match to match all right bourn myth in eighth position theyve got two draws and a win theyve had to grit them out that draw against forest was a last minute sano goal and then and violation of a of a complete supporter group in everton this weekend just like thoughts and prayers go out to them and to sean ds team but does he make it through the international break like its i its a little bit like man utd and that like where do you start with all of the problems at this club like new owners thats not going that that might be a start but thats going to its a longterm thing new manager i dont know squad just doesnt seem very good anyway were talking about bournemouth and its the opposite i think bournemouth theyre under the radar right now lest you forget they have a fantastic manager and weirdly a squad thats more cohesive dare i say better than you think the fpl takeaway is what your wild card showed and sano is a legitimately good fantasy pick expect more returns from bournemouth as we go theres i know i talked about like brighton being the envy of the midtable or whatever you want to call it i dont mean that in a in a derogatory way but like i its almost like bournemouth are like the envy of like the teams that should be in the bottom its like they dont have like a huge budget its like theres theres like not like theyre just but its like almost impossible to imagine them going down this season right like theres just something about the like the quality of their like they a good coach that its like theres enough competent players in that squad and its its its its impressive like this has nothing to do with fantasy but like theyre just i like theyre like a fun team to watch i think too like they ive enjoyed watching them bournemouth if youre if youre watching or listening we admire you all right we admire you im glad this im glad this one fell in your lap not inam forest chris wood i think hes been ive talked a lot about chris wood so far have you i dont know how much forest youve seen at all but like do you have any thoughts on chris wood never primary screened forest this season second screen or goal rush situation im impressed that wood has hes hes generated the fantasy points he has the consistency so thats great i have i have no quarrel with him great i think the question is whens the right time to get off of chris wood its sort like youve got the hes already given you the gift now you go to a party and you dont want to outstay your welcome i think thats right and i think that he is i but theres something to be said whether i keep him on wild card or not theres something to be said for a like like a forward who can return in bad fixtures that is not a guarantee like we like weve seen many times over the years forwards like who like they have a great run of fixtures like hes cheap like surely hell get something in those matches right but chris wood is one of those players who hes not like when they play a good squad hes not going to get a ton like he might not even get a single shot right but when they play a bad squad hes gonna get a hand shots hes probably gonna score right because hes like a pretty accurate shot taker and i think he took five shots so hes hes the goal scor was pretty was like the edge of like its a pretty bad goal for who are they playing to cons seed but it was but anyway so i think that hes impressed i think morgan gibbs rogers has had been off to a nice morgan gets white excuse me i got they were playing they were playing wolves and wolves is we dont have to talk about them for a few team spur spurs is interesting to see spurs at this point of the table where you think that maybe they were going to get off to a better start you one and one four points and their attack just hasnt gotten off the ground apart from the explosion that they had in gw 2 and they fell back to earth against newcastle and you saw those same issues that you saw last season with anges system where when it when it starts grinding to a hal it does and they cant y keep a clean sheet so i was f just the common sense fpl take here is all that said pedro porro is the fantasy option and then becomes a do you view pedro poro as a season keeper and if you do then i think hes just a very logical guy to get whenever it is that is convenient to you if you want to spend more transfers in your defense then i think pedroo you dont necessarily he doesnt feel like a hes compulsory you dont need him right now hes he took so many freaking shots i think he took six shots against newcastle insane if hes taking that many shots its clear that anch has said to him put his arm around him and said go for it my man like and he owns that space at the corner of the 18 yard box hes constantly getting the ball there and he has the he has a great cross and he has the ability to shot to shoot so i love any fullback that is that attacking so thats i think that to me is even a more take a bigger takeaway than what we thought wed be talking about sun salani madison etc theres nothing more to say there and maybe well see a better version of their attack when sank is healthy most likely we will but when will that be i dont know and they have the northland and derby in game week four which is gonna be tough should be interesting match very fun but and with no deck rice too so well they do have their new signing the spanish guy who is just like he got injured too didnt he i think hes i think hes like immediately injured so just like whos the guy who came to arsenal under vanger with a broken back kim krom exactly hes hes been hes been cmed already hell be like a new signing when he joins in november though brandon take us to chelsea well i im gonna trade ill ill trade chelsea and fulham okay even though fulhams your club you tell me i want to hear your co palmer is like wildly inessential rant okay well i dont i think that wolves match where palmer got three assists and a goal inflated our view and it inflated our view of him in many ways it was a great reminder of how incredible a fantasy asset he was last season of course how does that mean that im trying to force this argument that hes not a good as good a fantasy asset as everyone seems to think he is des despite him continuing to acrew fantasy points but he did he did all the dirty work against wolves he got one assist and a yellow card in the match this weekend and he blanked in the first week and everything that we have and everyone has been saying about chelsea remains true about this club is its just in a real moment right now and having of course theyre going to be having an identity crisis and i dont think even though moresa style of football is very attacking i dont think its enough to bring chelsea out of that identity crisis so i think i feel better saying this today and ive got two weeks to not have to eat my words i feel better swerving and fading palmer and taking and getting picks elsewhere with that money i would have spent on him than to have i do think the wolves match just inflated our sense a great hot chip song just turned into a great way to manage your fantasy team all right i think thats fair and now i will i will now take fulham because we did our trade here trash team trash stadium trash fans no i no im just kidding no i think no just joking my takeaway is that i dont know just that anthony robinson is jedi is is probably the best fantasy has okay no i do i have because we talked about him already my other take is that i am maybe slightly i cannot believe im saying this slightly interested in adat tror as a fantasy asa i never thought i would be there brand thats a place tell me why just because hes everywhere because he scored a goal no because hes like hes all he like hes just getting in the b hes hes been super aggressive like hes i dont know what his heat map looks like but it feels like hes just like he has a lot of the ball and hes like clearly they have decided like giving him the space to run with the ball is like something thats going to help them i not certain it has helped them so far this season but they hes a strange a strange player to be you rarely ever saw him even at wolves like start on the pitch he was always an impact sub and i thought that was going to be his role clearly marco silva has said we are a more dynamic team with him and this is our best starting 11 hes like consistently starting and hes good going forward is he good at much else its its difficult to say but as like smith row or all these guys are going to be consistent from smith row to a wobi to aatro so i would i would say if you dont if you hold your nose looking at aobi you should probably hold your nose with trii as well i think thats i think thats thats fair i dont think i could bring myself to have hes fun to talk about hes fun to watch hes hes hes just a fascinating player in general by the way going through this table im like i didnt know where anybody was outside of the top four this is this is fascinating so all right so weve were were at club number 13 which is west ham united gosh i am struggling to come up with a take for west ham jared bowen is this seasons version of the good fantasy player that is like too expensive on the hes like on the wrong team and he costs too much like its like hes playing pretty well right hes got lets see what hes got so far hes got a its just a goal and an assist although hes had a couple pretty tough fixtures with villa and man city but hes like but i just at 75 theres like 25 players in that price range and cheaper who i want more than him right so thats i feel like it could go two ways with west ham halfway through the season we could be like its all gone wrong these transfers they made the new managerial app appointment was terrible or it could be like wow they did it they had a great summer and i it could genuinely still go either way it feels like i still could see myself getting su check possibly on my wild card what a what an absolute legend that guy is every just each of the three matches to start the season same old suit check he didnt even start the match this weekend and he still comes on and youre just like anytime you flip on the west ham match hes getting a chance hes everywhere its ridiculous all right lets move on brandon youre next here with man utd man utd and 14th geez slower than i realized well i feel i feel vindicated in my like complete just like a dismay that all these pundits were picking man utd to finish even close to the top four its the song remains the same ten hog is a terrible coach a terri leader of men and their midfield is i mayu cannot a young inexperienced mayu cannot save this man utd midfield theyre gonna struggle all season its a its like and maybe the maybe mayu garnacho like maybe these guys have like another level they can reach out to theyre like theyre like a baseball team that has like a bunch of good players but no allstars like outside of outside of bruno and its like its hard to like to make the playoffs or win the world series when everyones pretty good no ones amazing and its like and its like is zer is zer is he gonna be that guy i dont know its like it feels like every and all of these spots its like theres no like theres no one whos making like a best 11 of the top six or whatever right so and i just wonder if its like and united fans will hate to hear it but i it may be that there were good transfers this summer but you dont have a smart enough person to put them in the right spots and move them around the correct way around the like field i wonder if a new managerial appointment halfway around halfway through the season helps this team if they stay 14th for much longer its its not going to be halfway through the season right itll happen like this fall this autumn so i ios ours you i know we get to see his first we get to see his first couple matches im excited about that well you see i dont think hes going to be managing the us this break i dont think theyve signed the contract is that right i think were still in terms agreed im surprised he didnt get it what he make sure hes got like all the blue mms in his pretty much lets take care of that before this weekend we got we gotta like the world cups coming up all right well lets lets move on to our final handful of clubs here leicester city i i okay ive got a positive takeaway here which is that they might just have enough like premier league pedigree like kicking through the kicking through that squad to stay up this season like theyre i it depends on whether they get an actual like lets lets leave points penalties out of the out of the equation for the moment right because that might come but like theres just like a handful of dudes whove its like i dont know i just feel like if you if you compare like the three promoted teams n have had a few moments but like just feels like lesters like i dont know its like theres enough quality dudes in that squad that i think they can survive i dont know like what do you what do you think i think that i am so biased against steve cooper why are you bu why you about i like steve cooper like i think hes pretty good hes so corny in every like postmatch interview is just platitude after i think youre being lu i think if he looked like no youre youre the one who youre the one whose mind go whos that guy you like whos that guy you like from twister if he looks like if he looked like glen if you look like glenn powell am i saying this stuff youd be all youre youre the one whose mind goes to that i but i dont know they have one point it like l luton town was raising peoples eyebrows at this point luten toown almost survived in all hony if we keep a fantasy focus then how about just jamie vardy right like he might be enough for them i didnt think i didnt think he was going to be anything and and im still not like looking at looking to buy him or anything like that by the way when did they sign i totally miss that they brought in edward did you notice that edward signed for lester i kind edward and jordan iou so they got a couple of crystal palace signes and bobby deckard over reed is in there so theyre theyre next weeks pod we can do a transfer roundup somewhat desperate transfers there i vout face i think is the best fantasy option on this team right now hes already jumped up to 41 based on the setpiece goal that he scored but still he might just be unsexy as he is as a center back the 40 defender to get this james justin aer he used to be he used to be m he used to be mr james justin is it is what is he priced at james justin is he 40 as well 45 see hes properly rated hes properly rated properly rated all right lets move on to crystal palace br crystal palace 16 place lower than i expected so is e too expensive so he has been as noted unlucky he probably should have at least one more goal than he does and hes come close a number of times his finish was elegant this weekend but is he like what you were saying about jared bowen is e is the allure of e an oasis in a desert a mirage i is the oasis a mirage with e and thats my concern with him is youre just paying too much for a guy whos not on a good enough team who sold some very good sturdy parts over the summer youre not paying that much youre paying 69m now like its not crazy given how good he is right like hes taking hes taking shots hes taking a lot of shots and creating a lot of chances that does typically translate into fpl results on a long enough time horizon right and so i still think theres something there its but it has been like a hug disappointing start he got a go and three bonus in the third game we so like we need to stop thinking about him as like a flop right like hes done as well as hes in eok territory where hes been frustrating to own but its not been a complete dis disaster yep and then you come back to that question of how many what results are palace rit large going to get this season all right ip switch josh ip switch like leaf davis like that they have some four million options that we could look at long term i am not buying the hype with with dap like i know he scored in gw three he was it in the liverpool match where he had a pretty big chance in the first half too but hes just 55m and i just dont know that i would be willing to spend more than 45m in any ipswitch players no disrespect to their supporters but like its just like it feels like theyre going to be struggling all year and i just dont want to have anybody from a club like that i do love greaves as their center back and our and again our buddy james holland backed us up there where greaves looks like hes hes locked that spot down and he looks strong on set pieces im moving im moving tbe to greaves as we speak then well done sir all right that brings us to wolves and wolves are in a youre not necessarily in a desperate position ever this early in the season but nothing is gone their way and gary oneal will be very frustrated they have so many to go back to your baseball metaphor they have so many great players who have the tools the tools but its just not coming together and then you get no fantasy output because of that i think what we have to be looking out for is will wolves form coincide with the good run of fixtures and we can consider some of these relatively decently priced midfielders in forwards from like hang he chan to and gomez and all of those guys but there is some its like theres theres like some meat on that bone with this team right but not yet not yet all right southampton tell me how good the briton diaz pick was no im gonna let you slide on that one i gave it to you in the on our deadline aod and that felt like enough so there is okay heres my real take and im sorry in advance but there is nothing to like on this team i cant remember the last time there was a premier league team that was that fielded a full 11 had players and i cant find anything to like we go to everton whos in 20th in a second i can think of plenty of things right like half theres like eight players on that team that i would consider if like with a new manager and a good run of form right its like but like with southampton theres theres like nothing right what about ramsdale coming in at goal hes already had a price drop so hes 44 so its an interesting way to solve a cheap goalkeeper thing thats interesting hes gonna get a ton of saves he is gonna get a ton of saves thats okay thats like half interesting ill give you that one thats half everything else is zero so instead of a zero to 10 ill give them a point were not spit take territory yet but ex do you do you can you count that take at all do you have any like no youre usually meaner about seth anthon than i am i dont know there i it always depresses me when you look at clubs like southampton where they go through they went through the recent moment where everyone was like this is the model club like they were what brighton is now southampton were a decade ago and everyone thought they were doing big think pieces on the back room staff and how they made it all work and brought players through their academy and now its now theyre just like i dont know id compare them to like sunderland like a long a historic club with a great fanbase that has just like all the allure is not apparent at the moment by the way when i made that ip switch def four million defender transfer a minute ago it asked me if i if i wanted to make the change because it would cost me an extra point4 i had not activated my wild card even though i had made like 11 transfers over already so wow no granted im sure i would have caught it over the next two weeks but still that is a reminder when you play your wild card activate your wild card do not forget to do that do not take a minus 36 or whatever because i made like 11 transfers so all right well that brings us to our final club here brandon is that right were were down to everton club number 20th i said a couple vague but nice things about them a second ago do you have any everton thoughts dominick calbert luen finally got some returns this weekend assist yep their defense i is the warning to fantasy managers is like p past glory is not a promise of future returns pford its not that pford is the victim of just bad defending pford has been awful as well which going back to the ramsdale thing like ramsdale is in a position to grab that number one shirt from pford pigford potentially with the managerial change to england i wonder if that is a big motivating factor but their defense has just been so terrible y it does i think its going to be circumstantial with everton do the right injuries to her fantasy template happen to where suddenly dominant covert leen seems like a possible option because right now everton just seem like a team a story to follow but not participate in a lot like theyre there are quality players that keep dropping in price right like so like michael leno is at 44m even bran weight if he eventually comes back hes hes he continues to drop in price hes down to 49 like he was he was quite good even fantasywise he was quite good last season and so like last season they got to a terrible start they red the ship they had a nice close they were very reliable club for clean sheets down the stretch and so i think that they could still figure it out right but they clearly havent yet and its just so funny because its what a difference the final 10 minutes that match makes right in terms of how we how were thinking about them right now because its a could be a dice ball his back and just werent patient enough exactly everythings fine now and now its like is he going to survive the international break its like an absol absolute waking nightmare for everybody exactly so all right well that is thats your rundown and i think were gna were going to end it there brandon so we have a we have another pod that well do next sunday where well cover maybe well cover some of the international or some of the transfer window moves too because i i thought i was following it i missed a bunch of 11th hour things and so we can update people on that a little bit talk more about wild card we can talk about more game we before for any transfers one or more that youre planning to make and

31,alwayscheating,aeJrbuv3Nb8,Common Sense FPL Takes for All 20 Premier League Clubs (GW1–3 Review),2024-09-03T02:26:53Z,"[Music] [Applause] hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast thank you for joining us my name is Josh happy to be back thank you to to Pat Riley the other Pat Riley for filling in on last week's podcast and uh Brandon how are you thank you for asking Josh as always I'm doing great we enjoyed uh uh what our friends in the UK would call a uh a holiday uh today I think everyone calls it a holiday you mean a bank holiday yeah but I guess I kind of second guess myself like is the bank holiday the same thing as a holiday let's try not to get into it I needed a bit of a I needed a bit of a breather admittedly Josh from the events of Sunday I think both you and I were riding pretty high with the game week game week three going into Sunday we'll get into it Liverpool is a bit of a thorn in our side you didn't enjoy um uh increasing your rank by 3.5 times uh in the uh the final match of the game week before a two we break I I don't want to winge too much because the fact that that one match did change the rank so much just shows early season blah blah blah we're all still very tight things will obviously change come game week four but what we need to figure out here Josh is what's the plan yeah like if those who don't have Salah what's the plan those who don't have Holland what's the plan those who don't have I don't know Brian and bomo uh do we need a plan there yep I mean I don't know about Momo uh the other the other two you know I talked about it a little bit I have not shouted this out yet but just as a heads up because I don't want to like get in too much we we promote enough stuff Brandon including our own stuff on here uh but uh I did start a substack for always cheating uh a couple of weeks ago called the FPL scouting notebook now of course we're not um supplanting the many many great newsletters that are out there Brandon but this is just quick thoughts from every match right so I did I this afternoon I really enjoying these I spent like a good two hours this afternoon uh they're great they're honestly great I mean when you had this idea you uh pitched it to me and you were inspired by some NFL fantasy content that you were consuming yep where is the very short brief quippy uh digestible fun email that you can just read with your morning coffee after the game week is is over so just a good compliment to the well thank you very much and it's been they were fun to do uh I was worried I was going to fade after like one but uh after three I still feel I still feel good let's see how I feel when I'm 6.9 million you know overall but so far uh I actually was technically on a green ARA by the way this week uh shockingly I was up like it was one of those like 15,000 you know Green Arrow but I'll take it um so the substack though is just always cheating. sub.com easy enough so um just always cheating. sub.com subscribe of course Brandon and um yeah but let's get back to to Fantasy proper I I you know yeah it was I suppose it's one of those weeks where if you had flipped the fixtures I'd be feeling great right now right I mean as as you said it's um like it the timing is a big factor here right if if we had ended with the man like if Man City uh at West Ham had been the final match of the game week you and I would be over the moon right about this uh this miracle Green Arrow i' be I'd be talking instead of I just got a green like I I nicked a green arrow it would be I cannot believe I got a green arrow after this weekend right so it's it's all about how how you look at it yeah I mean for me I mean we we're we're separated what like by one point and last week maybe separated by 5 to 10 points I'm on a distinct red arrow like I went from 540k to uh just just the wrong side of a million uh so it's strange but I I was honestly a little a little flabbergasted at that Sala um can you share your team with me so I can take a take a look here I'm curious uh what sure yeah yeah where did it all you know where did it all go wrong I want to I want to know I mean yeah so you can see here I started game week 1 2.1 mil and now we're at at 1 Point not one mil points are 70 points game we rank of 4 million it really went wrong in all of the like uh I guess like marginal characters Morgan Rogers is probably the biggest person to blame here because he and JIA Pedro were my two transfers I dropped the injured salanki for Jiao Pedro and thought well this is a uniquely difficult fixture for Brighton going to the Emirates I and and it looked like Brighton were going to be held until the dean rice red card y but that was a very nice um goal by Brighton ultimately interesting writeups in the athletic about how uh Arsenal's defense was a perhaps a little shambolic prior to the red card but I didn't feel like this goal was coming until they got going to have chances right even even Man City I mean obviously well man city been conceding conceded multiple goals for the season but yeah I mean the other teams always going to have chances so it's you can kind it's like it's easy to like rewrite the narrative but it is it is rare to trans because you you brought in Pedro and then you put him first on your bench which I assume was a like a price change thing right I think he was set to rise and then you assumed that salanki was set to fall he is still not fallen once I yeah I guess salani was uh locked because of injury uh who blood knows sure um and I yeah I did bring ja Pedro in largely because of both salani perhaps going down and Pedro going up and then Morgan roggers because I started him I thought he I I was really impressed by his performance against Arsenal and I thought surely he would get a return yeah against Lester and Aston Villa just even though they're I mean it's it's onan's team at this point he looks so strong in the Midfield it's interesting because they're the they're the same price and Morgan Rogers is the number 10 and Anana is ostensively like a kind of box to box I mean he basically is doing what um oh my goodness why am I forgetting his name the the player who who was their box tobox player last season whose name I'm uh yeah Douglas Luiz Douglas Luiz thank you and you know it may be that about unai Amory system that just lends itself to a little bit of freedom from these deep line players or or it's just kind of fluky but it it does feel a little unusual that you would you know basically go from this deep line player that was a great fantasy quite you know because you know he Luis was a pretty good fantasy asset last season and and for Onana to be kind of in the same boat now and it's like but still I don't think I would recommend an Nana transfer well his first goal came from a set piece so that one is kind of like not a necessarily would you qualify as an open Play goal sure um but yeah I am I am a little bummed about how I set up my team going into this weekend uh but you see the logic Anthony Gordon has been a differential for me and he got his goal last week which was very useful and now he's traded with esok and the problem is ESO is owned by a much larger percentage of fantasy managers and then guys like uh Smith row and cona very quiet Diego jot the Liverpool player that the one Liverpool player that you and I both own was the was the guy to not have this particular game week okay so I was feeling very here's the here's the Silver Lining I was feeling very bad about Dean Henderson after game week two and I was already teetering and saying no I want a premium goalkeeper four points from Dean Henderson feels like he basically got a 10-pointer uh and he's got a nice home fixture coming up in game wi four so I've gone from maybe strategizing changing my goalkeeper my editorial comment here is that I I think you just get you get too worked up about goalkeepers and it's like it's a real like don't sweat the small stuff thing to me because it's just very hard to get it right the difference between a a really expensive goalkeeper and a you know in a in a in a mediocre goalkeeper is yeah marginal in terms of the total Point like you know maybe in a particular run of fixtures you want the better keeper but even though there's there's there's reasons why right that we've talked about many times before why you don't want the more expensive keeper right like let's say you get David Rya well you know what happens if Arsenal have an incredible run of attacking fixtures which they do in like seven or eight weeks you're really going to want to have one of those Arsenal Defenders right because they're great at um you know they're they're great at hoovering up bonus points you know matches where they keep clean sheets sleep in particular uh obviously you know uh Gabriel's really good on set pieces Ben White gets tack returns but then you probably are going to want to have two Arsenal attackers as well right and so and so suddenly you have this this keeper who you know probably has a slightly better chance of keeping a clean sheet than a 4.5 million keeper but you've gobbled up one of your Arsenal spots right now that can't be a double up in the Midfield or HTS or whatever and he also was almost never going to get bonus points during the good fixtures right because they're going to keep clean sheets and they're going to be four-nil wins or something like that right um and even if you just like look at like just cheer like clean sheet odd percentages right it's like a a team that is heavily favored to keep a clean sheet in a match and you look at like the Vegas odds or whatever and it's like there may be 50% at absolute best to keep a clean sheet right and the team that you think is going to get smoked is like 40% right so the difference is is is is is pretty low so I I didn't mean to go on a little micro rant there but you know I just think like I actually um I I think Henderson is a perfectly viable um you know goalkeeper pick yeah yeah for for the premium goalkeeper I think the interesting one would be Allison and that becomes sort of a discussion of where you're at with your budget and Trent and because Trent is remarkably more expensive than any of these guys and I think then Allison becomes an interesting points grabber for all those clean sheets and and possibly covering your Rivals who do have TR but anyway I I I don't uh totally disagree with you and now that the Vibes have shifted it was the great goalkeeper Vibe shift in in game we 3 for me and I'm feeling just fine with Dean Henderson um what about you let's let's throw your team up on the screen yeah so um well there's some big news uh which is that I have activated my wild card that happened a couple of hours ago I um I just was looking at everything that was happening looking at price changes looking at my squad looking at who I wanted and I was like this is going to be so exhausting to like to get there through normal transfers right it's it's like it's such a mess and I'm gonna get crushed on team value which happened to me last season and it drove me absolutely crazy at the end of the year which and honestly part of it was just me being a little disengaged I think early on in the season last year and I was sort of I was off to I mean this is I think a real um a real problem and I actually you probably if if you're as disengaged as I was feeling last year you're probably not even listening to this pod right now because it's hard to I mean part of the problem is that when you get like I was off to a really bad start I both of us kind of were you know last last season and I was like screw this like I felt kind of like I just was like a little like kind of um what's the word I don't know just salty about about it right and I think like the problem then is that you don't you you like kind of get away from playing strategically right because you're like I'm just I don't even want to think about FPL for like it's International break is here I'm gonna go 11 days without thinking about FPL right you're not a high performance manager at that point yeah exactly and so you know in a window like that you know you might be a 0 5.6 PR like every option that might have been available to you in wild card is now done right so I sort of was just thinking about it and I was like well I kind of have to decide like literally before we do this podcast if I I'm going to do it or not okay uh because I because it was just like I don't even have um like Pedro the way you do right and so um and so I started tinkering a little bit and I was like I just I think I like this team quite a bit better and because you can s save five transfers I don't see as much I I don't see as much of a rationale for for like waiting for like a a rainy rainy day to to play my wild card right it was like I'm just going to kind of wild card and and be slightly aggressive although I wouldn't say that I'm wild carding from like a position of great strength I mean I'm like 984 th000 overall I'm doing fine right like it's it's not like a bad start but like I just don't look at my squad and think oh yeah like I'm gonna crush it these next few weeks right I what I I look at and think oh my God how much more how much further down am I going to go over the next three weeks before I can fix it with transfers right and so I think that was what what kind of motivated me um to go ahead and play the wild card but just before we do that I'll share um my screen with you and again I I know we're sharing screens and you know we do obviously this is still a podcast this is a an audio medium and so I don't want uh anyone to think that you know but I think just in general it's just that you you and I can look at this together right while we're um yeah of course while we're while we're talking about it um and I'll just try to be sort of conscious that I don't make reference to video stuff that um you know that people who are listening can't see um so yeah but 77 points uh in the game week it was um you know I thought um like again I F if if solid doesn't absolutely go off then I'm feeling pretty good about this game week right um I was going into that Liverpool match I was around 300K overall and uh feeling you know feeling pretty solid about kind of pushing on and um yeah I think after that match I mean I think the the interesting thing is is Joda who you mentioned already and what what we should do there um it's a question I haven't fully resolved yet because I don't um I don't know what the best I don't know what the answer is with with him I mean like I think he's fine I think he's a good asset it's it's like the fact that David Lise has been out scoring him the last two weeks it like I still feel like Joda is the preferred option of the two 7.5 million Liverpool midfielders I mean do you feel like David Louise has or Douglas geez too many l l Diaz yeah do you you feel like Luis Diaz has now supplanted Joda as the preferred second midfields option on Liverpool well if you just take the FPL points yes obviously uh but how can we then you put yourself into this position of trying to predict the future do we think that Doo jot has had particularly bad matches the last two matches no do I think that the team functions better with without J jot in the starting 11 100% not so it then it becomes a very difficult question of how long of a view do I want to take how patient do I have to be to actually get the value that I need out of Diogo jot and that's just a harder question to answer I I don't feel like if you're if you're thinking I just want to spend one free transfer over the international break jota to Lis Diaz doesn't feel like a worthwhile transfer to me not at all if if a step backwards right I mean it almost feels it's a little bit it's not quite the same because it's not as extreme but it's a little bit like the Morgan Rogers Onana situation right it's like looking at what we've seen so far you'd think yeah maybe Onana is the guy right but then if you sort of look at it more rationally and you just look at like positioning and right like shots and you're like I I you know you still kind of feel like you want I think Joda and you want Morgan Rogers uh of you know if you had to pick you know two of with those four so um yeah but I think I think it's really tricky um and so yeah I unfortunately I think what bumped me out a little bit my you know my transfers are both kind of bust I brought in concept and Smith row um I think honestly this is really why I have decided to Wild Card by the way too is I just um I just made too many mistakes in my uh in my gameweek one draft and I I just can't quite solve them all through transfers and I mean I have Lewis Hall who set to drop in price uh tonight we'll see if it actually happens right the price changes have been a little unpredictable but uh Hall set to drop in price um I haven't even had a chance to move him yet right because I had to move quansa um I had to move inku um you know I guess those are kind of the the you know the biggest ones but even like sun like I sort of feel a little caught out right now with sun I mean I got a great return from him gameweek 2 but at the moment it feels like I kind of have the fourth best of the expensive midfielders I have the fourth best one right and so that kind of feels like another issue that I want to solve but I you know you know if I could just go from like sun to Palmer or whatever uh or even just get Sola with like two transfers I I you know I might have considered just just doing that even if I had to burn four possibly um but it's the fact that I have to fix all these other issues still right that make it that make it tricky and so um even Harwood Bellis even a pre 60 Minutes not not that anyone's gonna lose sleep over your you're like last guy totally I mean may maybe Harwood Bellis too exactly so um wait well you were going to say something about flecking you've got beef with flein now a he's trash whole defense is trash I I don't know you know I'm sure it'll I'm sure when gameweek 38 rolls around flein will be the third highest rated keeper on the season and I will miss out on every amazing return of his I'm sure that's true but um I don't I don't I like this Brighton team Brandon I want to continue liking this bright team I'm not positive I can like this Brighton team if I have brenford yeah both you know but maybe he'll transfer them yeah maybe he'll move uh in January to to Brighton who knows right um so yeah so I'm referring to B no uh brenford uh I want to continue enjoying watching this brenford team play and I can't right now because I am I'm stricken with anxiety over when fckin is going to concede a goal and it seems to come later and later each week you know and so uh and so yeah I just want I want this trash out of my team um I actually kind of like brenford long term uh I think it's around gameweek seven maybe when they have a really when they started a really nice run of fixtures and I think Johan wiissa is somebody that we haven't really talked about too much but with Ivan Tony you officially is it did he go to it Saudi Arabia wherever he went I haven't seen any news yet yeah no I think that transfer happened on on Deadline day so with with with Tony gone um and the forward they signed injured until like the end of December basically yoan Wiis has it's it's his spot right and he's he's a six million forward uh who is like I don't he's not like the most you know I mean he doesn't blow you away when you watch him in these matches but it's like it's a really competent team right it's like a well coached well-managed team like if you had to pick between Mooney and and vissa for example like maybe it's a bad example because V already has a couple goals in the season but there's just something about like I just feel a little more confident that like that we're going to get something more out of out of Visa right like you look like looking five 10 weeks ahead yeah I like that I mean ambo and Visa together they're like a great Duo and that's yeah they you know they're like just one of those lowkey fantasy Duos where you're like well you could kind of get either one depending on your budget and your team set up and you probably get the share of some spoils from whatever goals that brenford are going to score yeah yeah exactly right and that's and and and emomo is a little harder to get cuz he's 7 million uh maybe uh maybe e turns into emomo at some point for some managers right like there's a that's an easy um kind of sideways move uh but you know so those are those are some things that uh I've been kick I actually don't have um Visa in my uh my squad right now they have a couple tough fixtures coming up so I think he's he's like he works a little better as a later transfer uh but I will share with you Brandon um this is like a first you know a first draft of a of a wild card team so take it with a you know a big grain of salt I uh I don't I have not firmed up um you know where what I'm thinking here um I think the the goalkeeper spot is kind of the first question for me and if you were making a goalkeeper transfer this week or you're wild carding um I think that Kappa I mean and like and I'm like firmly in the like I I wish I could just like literally roll out I would rather take an extra 4 million and just get a zero every week right like if if that were possible um like I just coldkeepers are so worthless in this game I feel like and so it it's coming down to Kappa and uh Dean Henderson for me as my as my goalkeeper pick and I don't know I'm sort of I thought Kea had Kea had a nice performance um in his Opening match I mean obviously they did concede a couple of goals but um uh I don't know I I feel like he might be he's he's a talented keeper uh I don't know I mean it's you're stretching you're well listen you find me a keeper that you actually want right now I mean yes yeah if if you include Allison then yes but right like in the sub Allison bracket find one that like gets you excited there's there's no sure yeah there's there's no way to win or lose this conversation I mean you're basically going from flecken to flecken and that and and that's fine on a wild card you have that luxury get whatever flecking you want yeah uh born the fixtures coming up they're home hosting Chelsea followed by Liverpool then it's a good coupling with the Southampton and Leicester and then the fixtures are diabolical starting in gameweek 8 AR Villa City it's It's Tricky it really is uh the question is really whether you um should even look like I me you want to look in the kind of medium term I suppose right um but like I I think think the problem is if you look at it through a I actually was thinking about that I was like well which like cheap keeper has already gotten a couple of tricky matches out of the way and I mean unfortunately that might lead me back to fleen uh which like that would be really depressing if I like wild carded flecken out and then Wild Card him back in over the next couple days quote an incredible story you just wild carded the same team you had in gameweek one just go can you imagine if you just went straight back no I actually think I might end up with Dean Henderson though um I do feel better about it now that gayi stayed right I think that and they did they did make a center back signing as well and so I think I think they're okay I'm still amazed that they let Anderson go I felt like he was really good for them last season I don't get it either yeah good good has he started yet for Fulham I I probably know that he started in the efl Cup match and at that point I thought he was like a dead certain to like start every other Fulham game From Here to Eternity and he did not start over the weekend it was Depp and passie again yeah um so we'll see I mean ultimately he's destined for the starting 11 it's just a matter when yeah I feel like you wouldn't uh they and they must have given him some kind of assurance right like you wouldn't he wouldn't leave a starting spot at Palace to be a backup he's captaincy material like as soon as as soon as karney gives that up uh FPL captaincy right because you've been you've been captaining you've been captaining Tom Kerney in FPL for the first three weeks and so you call me Captain Carney uh and that that's ex that I'll never change I'll never change I refuse so um so my backline is um keeping Robinson of course I think he is uh absolutely fantastic and I mean it just like he's turned into such a like Amazing Fantasy asset because he's now getting attacking returns consistently enough that even when they concede he is he's valuable right he's got two assists and and two bonus in the season and um I feel really good about him at 4.5 um I think cona is another one where um you know it's unfortunate that they conceded to um Lester a little late in that one as well but um I feel I feel good about him too right it's just a cheap way into a competent defense um Lewis dunk I think uh is another one where it's sort of he's 4.5 and uh again you know talk about a kind of like captaincy you know Captain Center back kind of player right he's just like a super reliable solid can can Nick a couple of headed goals every season you know type option um so it's it's a pretty cheap back line and then I've got um celba as my one expensive Defender the one question for me is whether there's any short-term value in moving celba to Van djk um for for a couple of weeks um possibly moving back to CBA at some point but at the moment my plan is just is just to roll with CBA in in and save my transfer uh and then I've gone with Axel uh tonbe as my um as my four million Defender I mean you pick it's it's like it's like the goalkeeper thing right you pick you pick a four million guy they're all terrible just don't spend more than 4 million right uh and uh and I don't know like there are like moments when Brighton seem kind of kind of Saucy and fun you know and you're like well maybe maybe there's like a match where they just everyone gets switch feels Saucy fun totally why do I keep saying Brighton I I got Brighton on the brain you're really I mean I'm counting two Brighton players in this team so and that's more more Brighton players than you often see so you're definitely thinking about it yeah so our our friend James Holland who came on the patreon Pod who's a been a long time it switch season ticket holder fan is he's he he told us he he dip switch to optimistic as he is to finish 15th in the table you'd think there's some points that have to be coming for this team uh sooner or later I mean I guess they picked up a a point against fulam for instance yeah and leaf Davis the leaf leaf leaf Legends we need some kind of nickname for him uh yeah Leaf Legend though picks up uh I think he got an assist and two bonus in this match so he is he is off and it's you know I mean God if he was four million he'd be like one of the most own players in fantasy but at 4.5 it's just a little too much a little too much switch for my blood Brandon but at 4 million let's let's let's let's toss one of their options on the bench uh through the Midfield um the big thing here is I have Palmer and solo so am I chasing points I don't know I mean I'm probably getting like the second and third best fantasy access in the game so I I don't really feel like that bad about it um and part of what I like about it is I feel like there's a version of this like I feel like there's a kind of rotatable like a rotating third forward that I can use here as well and so um I it almost feels like I've got a little too much money in my Midfield still um but at the moment I I've got uh Smith row who I'm holding on to uh maybe maybe I shouldn't be I I mean I thought he was really U kind of just like I don't know he was out of it in that if switch m i i i he had a couple chances like right before he got subbed right like and that was kind of I think I think what you're seeing was Smith row is just a young man who has played his entire life at Arsenal at one club and as talented as he is going to a new club across town it's it's not easy especially for for the younger players and he's being a lot is expected of him like he's coming now into Fulham and they expect him to be like the the the general of that attack it's going to take time I think and I agree like he looks a little you he he's not there yet he's not finished and so he might turn into Morgan Rogers which would save me like 04.5 that probably that probably is the sensible move right um I mean honestly I could get Onana if I wanted but I I I I still feel like I feel like Rogers is still is still probably the more sensible pick there but also make a for a little bit less of a benching headache I I just feel like it's always tricky when you've got when you've got basically eight Midfield starters right that you want to play like or you know when you've got sort of uh three forwards and five midfielders all of whom are sort of competing and every single week you're sort of I don't like having that kind of headache in fantasy right well yeah let me ask you this about this draft and we we talked a lot about fifth midfielder before gameweek one and I ended up with a 5.5 Bron Diaz as my fifth mid yeah you've thought about this a little bit you've gotten off Harry Winks you now have your fifth attacker would uh be Sano or Smith r at 5.5 yeah where are you at with the 4.5 guys like Morgan Rogers is as low as you think you can go given what we've seen so far no I I mean I think so just because I I I do think that like you you get quite a lot from him at five I think he's 5.1 now right you get quite a lot from him at 5.1 is that worth the extra point5 million or6 or whatever it probably is honestly uh and I think what makes it so just to quickly go through my Midfield right now I've got uh Salah Palmer e Sano and Smith row and seano to me is just correcting a mistake um and actually it was kind of the impetus for the wild not I shouldn't say the impetus but one of the reasons I sort of was convinced is we can call the impetus of Salwa that's yeah Sal yeah that's right Salo is absolutely 100% the impetus even Cole Palmer is like a luxury move that you can do when you're wild carding right um but the what was you know seano not having risen in price even once is kind of shocking uh considering that like in every in every like way that you look at him I feel like he's been fantastic like he the the underling stats are good the actual FPL stats are good and he looks awesome right even if you're just watching highlights of these matches like Sano is heavily involved right like he looks like he's really even you know even with solank out he's gonna take on a lot of you know attacking you know a lot of the attacking potential and so um he's just like kind of a I think for most managers a square peg for any problematic round hole that we have so Joe Pedro is super cheap for the third forward at 5.5 yeah Morgan Rogers is as we discussed like probably the cheapest fifth mid you'd want and Sano is he's 5.5 right so y uh it's rare that people are paying enough attention to Bourn myth and have a 5.5 hole that they need to fill unless you're in a situation like this where I mean I just did it last week I mean I got I got Smith row over Sania but like I think but if you're trying to get an expensive basically if you're trying to fit three premiums into your squad you're going to need to fill it out with some of these cheapies right and and I think the problem then is you don't necessarily have players you want to start every single week right and I think that's where to get back to your question about the more expensive bench option right I think that's where the um having a more expensive player makes more sense because you can kind of uh you know talk like you can you can rotate them a little bit and so um so then my forward line and this to me is is the problem I suppose uh is um I mean is it a problem I guess you you tell me right and so the problem is that I have um I have Holland obviously uh Holland's not going anywhere uh and uh and I just don't care I don't I don't like any version of my squad that doesn't have him in it I don't care how much how many other spots I can upgrade okay like maybe maybe I'm missing um who's talking about getting rid of Holland at this well just a lot of people are like there's the kind of um Advanced stats folks are kind of like dropping him in the short term I don't know probably not before the brenford match but maybe ahead of gameweek five I don't I don't want to get into it because my my goal this season is not want to either yeah yeah you and I are not going to um no flame Wars this year Brandon we're on we're on a a firmly on we're we're just this is a friendly friendly World we're not going to get our we're not going to stick our foot in the uh we're the swiland of FPL this exactly we're an island onto ourselves and so so what I have is I I have Holland I have Jaa Pedro who um I honestly to me that's another mistake that I'm correcting I just I should have been on him uh uh you know from well actually I mean I I mean I don't really know I guess I I guess I I don't need to kick myself too much because the player that I got was Chris Wood and Chris Wood's been excellent and in all three of the matches including gameweek two where he blanked he was really good and I I'm sure a lot of people out there have not watched like any Forest so far this season but he's been great and know he's he's you know in this last match he I think he took five shots in the match scored a goal had a brace late that got chocked off uh played the full 90 minutes I think there was some risk like earlier about whether he was going to you know be kind of rotating a little bit but he's he's been I think he's been absolutely fantastic so far this season and so my feeling with him now is maybe I just keep him and I just and I just sort of rotate him a little bit and that he's probably solid enough that that you don't necessarily need to uh move him for one of these kind of other options that have been a little inconsistent and so the problem though is you know there's no Wally Watkins in this squad there's no um there's no ESO right like there's uh a number of players that um that I can't have and that's just sort of the price you pay if you're going to have Holland Salah and Palmer right that's a that's almost what is that I mean 27 it's almost 40 million of my 60 million budget in in three players I mean it's absolutely insane right U the gamble you're making here which is I think why you're making it is it's one of the better bets you could place yeah is you're you're taking Cole Palmer over a second Striker basically you've got two third tier Strikers and Cole Palmer yeah I think that's I think that's exactly right and uh and also I guess banking that like these 5.5 million guys uh or or what you know I'll just use starting price here right but the 5.5 million guys Sano Smith row Pedro Morgan Rogers you know you pick the kind of three or four different options there that those players can be good enough right that they can sort of get you to like a a 6.5 um is uh you know option be best as uh Ivanka Trump would say yeah I don't know what that I have no idea what that's reference to um but so that's that's where I am um and so so uh yeah that was kind of unexpected I kind of I thought I would kind of drop that on you brand you didn't know I was going to reveal a I had no idea and then you actually showed us a draft I mean I thought you were going to tease it for next week you know we got a whole International break to work through but I guess still you're going to see a whole different Draft when you turn tune into always cheating next Monday morning very very likely exactly and uh yeah and you know honestly I will say too and not to do a second shout out for the substack but part of the value of of doing this is I have been watching match highlights of everything that I kind of missed over the weekend and you do like you really do like you don't have to be ready to suback do this but like if you're if you're like taking fantasy seriously you should be watching highlights I mean you don't have to I mean like you know they always whatever I'm sure I'm sure you can watch them in any country you're in right but in like NBC um and peacock they have the extended highlights and right and sometimes you look at them and you kind of like H like this is like 13 and a half minutes I don't have this much time but for whatever reason they decid to spend four and a half minutes on the lineups the start of every one of these and then they show like the opening minute of the match right so all you have to do is you pull up the extended highlight you skip forward about three minutes and 40 seconds and then you're where you want to be so you're really watching like a f minute highlight package and I think it is a quick way to be like oh wow like like you know Morgan Rogers is one of these players who like if you just looked at his returns you're like ah like three straight blanks but you know I think especially in those first two matches you saw somebody who was really involved right in the I mean obviously this is why you brought him in but like you know had a game we three but um you know you just you see things that you don't necessarily see if if you're just looking if if you're just watching the featured matches and um and then looking at FPL results right or points well I'll be uh I'll be jealous of you having mosala going into game week four I my my current plan is I have to roll unless I want to take a hit to get Mo which I don't think I do I think ultimately what I need is two free transfers to get Gordon and jot to out and Salah for a fifth mid any chance that you would Wild Card yourself have I talked you into it a little bit if I planted a seed well um I mean I don't look at my team and say uh I see problems when I look at my team but yeah um no not I I'm not feeling the stress uh that you clearly and and you're not necessarily feeling the stress I understand you're kind of like you just feel like this is the the best strategy for you and I get that yeah I guess what I would say is I'm feeling um very engaged with the game right now you know like I feel like um like I'm sort of I'm feeling good about like my ability to kind of make confident decisions right and just sort of like trust my instincts a little bit and so that's that was what is what kind of has pushed me to do it right just this feeling like yeah let's go for it let's let's try yeah clearly a lot of our listeners are kind of thinking either wild card or the Price Market is kind of like in full swing right now and going into the international break usually there's a lot of action at the start of the international break especially the first one when people are like re re fine-tuning their team and then the market should probably slow down yeah in a few days and you can kind of chill out and and take a step back for the middle part of the international break but a couple questions here one from Step Curtis who has thoughts on early transfers to navigate price Rises price Falls earlier in the season and during during International breaks and John Reynolds has uh said nobody ever should I use all three of my free transfers during this break so I think from your perspective Josh you you are seeing these price changes and are thinking that's going to be something you're going to feel the effects of later in the season so you know and you agree with this right I mean I think of you as somebody who's very like conscious of of price changes and and sort of like the market yeah and I think it's fun to take advantage of it at this point Joe Pedro is a great example of this where he's going you're going to make money off of this guy over the break yeah yeah and you don't you don't have to bring in these players thinking I'm a I'm a 100% believer in jaia Pedro yeah you could actually turn just just being a two to three week believer in jaia Pedro is going to mean you can make a better financial decision with your team later on in the season and especially when you're looking at that late season Wild Card the more money you have the better uh so I I am for like playing the price Market earlier in the season the trick with early transfers in the international break is Lord knows what's going to happen to these guys when they go off to their International Teams I think I'm like more compelled to go for guys in the FPL transfer market who maybe don't have an international call up yeah that's true I mean I I think they're not traveling that I guess and it's kind of like situational too right like I feel like um if you have like a decent bench like if your bench is decimated right and like if one more player gets injured then you are absolutely going to have to um like and you use like you use your transfer early and like your team is basically 11 strong right and like one injury is going to kill you then then maybe don't use the transfer early but if you have like a little bit of bench dep then then I think it's fine to go ahead and do it I mean I don't know I don't think like it's I don't think we get that many we don't get as many um International break injuries as we kind of think we do right I certainly do it's a little bit like um holiday rotation right this idea that like you've got to go 15 deep on your in your squad for the for the holidays right because there's so much rotation during you December and then you look and you're like like everybody played every match you know it's like yeah maybe pep like outside of like Man City though you're probably pretty safe well I feel like we've already given a pretty good gift to our listeners there with the Wild Card talk but we do have a bonanza coming up after kind of a a short sort of housekeeping break here where we're going to go through all 20 clubs and just give what we're going to call Josh common sense that's right takes yeah and I like this you sens people did do we have Thomas Payne on the

audience for our ad Partners it's a big help to us too check out the description and the link for your chance to get those $500 gift cards all right Josh now it is time to do our Common Sense fantasy [Music] takes I think you expressing this through your wild card are saying three weeks is kind of this we're at this pivot point where now we've got like critical mass with data information grass test data test we now have real sort of like takes to get us to the next step in the season yeah and I think the the real goal here is to do what I think um you know I think especially because we're we're we have we have two weeks right to to sort of do some thinking ahead of um you know ahead of game week four and so there's it's a chance for us to to basically like take a step back and sometimes again I talk about like the forest from the trees and and I think I really got caught up in this kind of thinking last season which was I was really letting other people take the temperature of of the season right and like when it came to transfers or went to Wild Card do all this kind of stuff I was relying way too much on what other people were saying right and it was because I feel like I didn't have my own kind of rules of thumb about H Squad right uh heuristics if you will Brandon you know if I didn't have these these 20 heuristics that were about to that that' be a great that that' make sure that no one listened to this episode great keyword just became a great uh title for a podcast episode so basically um and again we've already like we're like 50 minutes in already but we're going to do basically these are going to be um like one kind of lightning round big picture thought for all 20 clubs okay so um you know just kind of like quick thought and and obviously this you know we're gonna keep this fantasy focused right but like but just kind of one oo the lightning round is on so um let's get going here let me just GNA sitp from my I have a rare that I I I pod with a coupe glass Brandon we we have a comment in the in the chat from our friend Pat who was on last week you're sipping on a fancy you can check us out on screen on our YouTube page but yeah what you get so you got what you got my wife turned in uh the final draft of her book to her publisher and so yeah you played a tiny part in that as well Brandon you got a got my fingers and everything fingers in that um so uh yeah not in getting it published but just in the actual design um so yeah we're just supporting the real talented people in our lives that's what we we're celebrating tonight so that's that's amazing all right so that's why I'm extra spicy this evening um yeah so let's go into it I think um you know I think the the the more interesting way to do this maybe uh I I was going back and forth I was like should it be alphabetical should it be um table order and I've decided that that table order is the way to go because ultimately the teams at the top of the table are the ones that fantasy managers are tend to be more focused on and so I think it makes sense uh to start there and and so um we're really just going to go uh one through 20 and uh and and talk about these clubs and then um and again we're going to keep it fantasy focused and then um next week we'll do more of a proper game week four preview but there's really no point in doing that ahead of a whole week of of international travel and fixtures and things like that right because there'll be some there'll be some breaking news I mean half the half the league might move to fener Bach Brandon in the next handful of days right so we just we just don't know by the way I saw a picture of Jaden soncho on the pitch on Sunday and I was like I somehow just completely missed that he moved I and I know I knew there was like rumors about him moving but him moving to Chelsea I mean I actually started laughing when I saw it because I was like what is he he's like the ninth like I don't know whatever I guess I we don't need to get into that do that could be our an our yeah that's that's that's a hard pass too much uh oxygen has been devoted to the Chelsea you're right you're right you're right you're right what I what I think is actually interesting about it is is Manchester United kind of came up with nothing because for a while there was going to be a swap with Raheem Sterling Raheem Sterling ends up at Arsenal and Manchester United like here's who did they get they didn't get anybody they're still playing Marcus Marcus rashford so that's very fun for them yeah yeah yeah yeah Mason mount's injured now too right so it's like yeah um so all right so let's start at the top of the table here uh here's my first thought on men maybe we'll go like uh back and forth how about that I do want you to okay and then if you have an extra there have an extra thought we can we can add it but my my uh first thought on Man City uh to kick things off here and first first overall at the moment tied with Liverpool on nine points uh I suppose they're ahead yeah they're head on goal difference actually they're tied on goal difference but they've scored two more goals um my my first thought in man city is that um the defense uh probably needs to be um re-evaluated and like we probably basically my thought is that we shouldn't be drawing any real conclusions about their defense at the moment because uh the like Rod has they they just haven't had rodery for the first three weeks and he is he though not a Defender himself is incredibly important to the defense and not only is he not there to protect the defense but I also wonder if it has forced them to play gavard all as as a as a center back right like I I wonder if if pep has not had the confidence to like let him push forward more right um as a result of not having rodere in the center because I feel like we saw a more kind of attacking left-wing version of him in the past and he's he's been pretty pinned I feel like to the to the back line yeah yeah that is interesting um I feel like guardal it's it's just more of I I think it's less about the formation and the tactics and more gardiol might just be a slow starter we saw this with him at the start of last season and you know City just seemed to find that like that destruction Rhythm uh sort of Midway through they're a Onan fantasy team right now kind of the pleasure of it and maybe when foden is I don't know yeah but at the moment it's you're right it's it's a oneman team and so uh there's there's not like the problem is there's no value anywhere else right it's not like it's not like there's a 4.5 million defender in there I mean actually there is and Rico Lewis but I don't necessarily trust him um with Rod coming back right to be a consistent starter right because Rico Lewis's great cool fantasy value is that inverted full back thing that he does and now Walker finally got on the pitch in gameweek three so yeah that's just like a firm wait and see yeah so for Liverpool then it's kind of like I think the common sense take here is it's the complete opposite of Manchester City and that Liverpool are the Manchester City of this season as far as fantasy where you're like how am I going to fit all of the guys who I want into my team and you would yeah that's another yeah you want a midfielder I mean they don't really have any forwards so you don't have to worry about that um but but what's fascinating about this new season with Liverpool is I think I was able to talk myself into not having mosal in gameweek one because I thought Arie slot's coming in who knows what the level of discontent or discom population is going to be and what we have seen is whether it's to do with slot or whether it is just these players being veteran winners is this Liverpool team looks like they kind of want to send this version of Liverpool off into the sunset on a real high from Van djk to Salah and everyone in between they're just like in some incredible form and I think we're going to be dealing with Liverpool assets all season for the good like so get as many Liverpool assets as you can a Pronto yeah and that that's the other issue with my wild card is I only have one at the moment and Salah it's hard to get even more than one in if you're going to go really expensive I mean it may be that Cole Palmer just can't fit I mean that that would that's the only that you know if I did that I could I could still have Joda and Trent like that's interesting does like a 4.5 million defender in Cole Palmer is that worse than Joda and Trent like it's actually a really interesting question it's it's close spoil alert for whatever we're going to say about Chelsea but I do think that it's much it it it's overstated with Cole Palmer right now I do not think that he is necessary for a fantasy team that's doubled with Salah and Holland okay I think he's and and it's like I love I have nothing bad to say about the player and the fantasy it's the price the price is illogical if you're going for Holland plus Salah and I see really no way around that and that might be me just playing as a template manager but I just think it's it's true facts no I I I think it's true I think the uh part of my thinking there was I could kind of maybe do a little back back and forth with him and and Saka right like you know like follow like following the fixtures a little bit this feels I don't think I've ever heard you talk about you know swapping swap poke I think yeah we always you and I don't like to say it because it's hokey pokei in America it's hokey pokei in the UK we're very aggressive and we're very finger pointing uh Centric here in here in the US we we poke people exactly we we Hoke and we poke we also Hoke people you know we do both really yeah um so yeah I think it's uh you might you might be hon again this is actually exactly why this exercise is useful right because when you look at it a big picture sense you're like yes what do I think about Liverpool what I think about them is that I want three of their assets right um and so that that that is that's very interesting so that's that's something for me to think about a little bit um that would also enable me to maybe get Ali Watkins or dare I say uh Nico Jackson um but let's let's let's let's put a button in that for a second let's to to Brighton and hve Albi and Brandon um there's a lot to say here obviously um we talked about Pedro already um I think uh Mina is an interesting talk about another another 5.5 million player I think he's playing Super well um he's the uh the right- Winger for um for Brighton and um finally picked up an assist I guess it was one of those like rebound assist but he honestly could have scored on the chance right and so he was well in yeah and so I think uh I think the Mina is a um a really good you mean like I'm not like first name on the Wild Card level right but I just think he's like I think he's he looks really good I think the whole team I just like I just admire Brighton so much like I admire um like every like the way that they do business while still staying competitive itive is super impressive to me like it's they're they're like they should be like the Envy of every like kind of non top six CL and they make uh hiring new managers look easier than like most other uh teams in Europe you know herler is like hit the ground running he looks great looks confident the team looks great and I'm with you on MTA MTA is basically like uh Moma on the right hand side but for cheaper so I think that's a great budget call yeah I think be 65 or s and and mint is 55 so um yeah not as not as like polished maybe as as yes correct yes I would agree with that yeah Mata Pro price rose up to 6.6 okay so there's a 1.1 savings there big big difference then huge actually really um all right so we're on to Arsenal now Arsenal the take here is I the the take is it kind of changes week to week after game week one I thought the only player anybody needed in their sads was Kai HTS after gameweek 2 I thought the only player anybody needed in their squad was Bai Osaka after game after game we or or Rya for for that matter Arsenal are simil so like I was saying with Liverpool get them all Arsenal is kind of like pray that you're lucky week to week that you have the guy who gets the points and that goes for their Defenders as well is Gabrielle finally going to get his corner kick goal this this match who knows so Arsenal I think have presented decent enough value but they appear like they're going to be a frustrating team to buy into fantasy wise because you can always justify having them and they might not pay you back the way these like Surefire bets from Liverpool and earling Holland might what do you think about Saka I mean like three returns in three but it's like it doesn't it's like he feels like he just feels like such a step below uh Palmer Salah and um and um and Holland as like as like the kind of like it's like a premium asset I disagree in that I think Saka will outscore Palmer uh this season wow I think he's a better pick than Palmer okay all right I'm excited to get to our Palmer section then uh I want to I want I want to see what you have to say there but let's move on to just just like just real quick on on Saka I I I don't totally disagree with you on the sort of skepticism there because the question remains Saka ceiling is is really it's fuzzy I don't want I don't know what it is so that's really the red flag for him exactly because it's he's super consistent and obviously that's that's hugely valuable but it's like if you look at like a a Luis Diaz and I know small sample you know etc etc we always have to say that but like you know if you look at like what Diaz or Joda have done in the first like three weeks for example right it's like they're not necessarily as consistent but they are like because they're a little more explosive in terms of their returns it kind of averages out to the same right especially when you factor in um the 3 million price difference between them right so um I don't know there's there's there's you know something to think about there um all right let's move on to Newcastle my my thought on Newcastle is I'm kind of impressed that they're in fifth like it feels like feel like they shouldn't like they've had three pretty underwhelming performances to start the season um they locked into a win versus versus Spurs they were under under the C by Spurs for a good deal of that match but you do I guess I do tip my hat to Newcastle for for grinding out that's a how you kind of have to do it some some weeks y I feel maybe a little bit more optimistic like there are like green shoots for Newcastle and I think I think we will see much better from them maybe the international break will be rejuvenating just out of curiosity look at newcastle's fixtures coming up it's Wolves Away in game week four followed by Fulham City Everton Brighton it's not like a great run be honest mix bag yeah yeah so I I I think I'll be ready to get rid of Gordon for sure coming going into game we five and that will hopefully work into my Solem move yeah that makes that makes sense um so yeah not a lot maybe it's just there's not we don't have a lot positive to say because we started out this season really I I started the season with with two Newcastle I wanted to have three and I had to move move out of Gordon at the last minute for yeah I almost did ni pop as well exactly so it's like but they're they're sort of putting together some kind of uh I don't know they just it's it has not been inspired like you said maybe um the fact they haven't played inspired and there they're still you know seven from nine is uh um says something um all right so that we move now to uh brenford yeah this one's pretty easy it's it's exactly what we said at the top of the show Ivan Tony is officially out of the mix therefore you are free to get momo and Visa uh and that's really all you need to know yeah I think fixtures are bad coming up so this is something you can sort of put a pin in and come back to but that's those those are the that's the real deal that's the news but they and they and they do get better right because um I was I was looking earlier and they are um I think it's and by the way and bomo is now up to uh fifth overall in points for midfielders like he is he is really uh doing quite well and we're we probably have to like start taking him more seriously as a as a buy um but yeah once you get past uh City away Spurs away in four and five it's a really nice run they have three home fixtures in four one of of those home fixures that zip switch at home Fulham Bournemouth Everton Lester um you know especially if you're if you're targeting in those those like like Visa right there's a it's a really nice really nice run and um there's there you know I think that that could be really interesting so um all right so let's move on to Aston Villa I mean we did talk about uh you know we we I mean we talked about Onana and Rogers a fair amount already so we've kind of already done our V section the one thing what do you think about the defense on Villa because that's you know Emory his calling card has been defense typically yeah so what it's four four goals conceded you should be able to freeze the uh the top of the table here like you kind of like an Excel you know so that I could see but I what is it four goals for four goals against then for them um yeah I mean I just don't see it as a problem long term right the Personnel hasn't changed really I mean they they have lost Douglas Louise but um I just really have a lot of respect for Emory as a manager right I just think he's going to sort it out I mean they still have Emy Martinez and so I think it's just kind of fluky right like they absolutely could have kept a clean sheet in that Lester game right it was like they Lester basically had one chance and that was the one they scored on and so just happened to fall to the goat exactly you yeah yeah so okay yeah yeah yeah so I think the frustrating thing for Villa is they just haven't really become as fantasy relevant as we expected them to be and by the time they might be ready then Champions League will begin totally that'll be the added layer of anxiety of what's going to what's Watkins minutes he still going to be a 65 minute sub yepa it's it's hard to say and Duran playing so well right I think that's it it complicates thing because you don't need Watkins to play the full 90 every match I you have seen a good amount of squad depth at Villa at the start of this season so that's at least encouraging in terms of what you know how maybe Emory won't have to rotate the starting 11 so much it's just that he's just going to have to limit guys minutes match match to match all right Bournemouth in eighth position they've got two draws and a win they've had to grit them out that draw against forest was a last minute Sano goal and then an annihilation of a of a complete uh supporter group in Everton this weekend just like thoughts and prayers go out to them and to Shawn D's team but does he make it through the the the international break like it's risky yeah it's a little bit like Manchester United and that like where do you start with all of the problems at this club like new owners that's not going that you know that might be a start but that's going to it's a long-term thing new manager I don't know the squad just doesn't seem very good anyway we're talking about Bournemouth and it's the opposite I think Bournemouth kind of they're under the radar right now lest you forget they have a fantastic manager and weirdly a squad that's more cohesive dare I say better than you think I guess the the FPL takeaway is what your wild card showed and Sano is a legitimately good fantasy pick expect more returns from Bournemouth as we go yeah they sort of I mean I know I talked about like Brighton being the kind of Envy of of the mid-table or whatever you want to call it I don't mean that in a in a derogatory way but like I it's almost like Bournemouth are like the Envy of like the the teams that should be in the bottom F you know it's like they don't have like a huge budget it's like there there's really like not um like they're just sort of but it's like almost impossible to imagine them going down this season right like there's just something about the the like the the quality of their like they have a good coach that it's like there's enough kind of competent players in that Squad and it's sort of it's it's it's impressive like this has nothing to do with fantasy really but like they're just you know I I like they're like a fun team to watch I think too like they I've enjoyed watching them Bournemouth if you're if you're watching or listening we admire you all right we admire you yeah I'm glad this yeah I'm glad this one fell in your lap Nottingham Forest yeah I mean uh Chris Wood uh I think he's been I I've talked a lot about Chris Wood so far have you I don't know how much Forest you've seen at all but like do you have any thoughts on Chris Wood I've never primary screened Forest this season uh second screen or goal Rush sort of situation i' I'm impressed that wood has has um you know he's he's generated the Fantasy Point he yeah the consistency so that's great I have I have no quarrel with him great I think the question is when's the right time to get off of Chris Wood it's sort of sort of like you've got the he's already given you the gift yeah now go to a party and you don't want to outstay your welcome yeah I I think that's right and I think that he is um uh I but there's something to be said whether I keep him on my wild card or not there's something to be said for a um you know like basically like a forward who can return in bad fixtures that is not a guarantee like we we like we've seen many many times over the years forwards like like oh they have a great run of fixtures like he's cheap like surely he'll get something in those matches right but Chris Wood is one of those players who he's not like when they play a really good squad he's not going to get a ton like he might not even get a single shot right but when they play a bad Squad he's going to get hand shots he's probably going to score right because he's like a pretty accurate shot Taker and I think he took five shots I mean so he's you know he's really um uh and the goalie score was actually pretty it was like the edge of like it actually a pretty bad goal um for who are they playing uh to concede uh but it was uh but anyway yeah so I think that he's um impressed I think Morgan Gibbs Rogers has has had been off to a nice start GI Morgan Gibbs white excuse me I got yeah yeah they were playing they were playing wolves and wolves is uh yeah we don't have to talk about them for Spurs Spurs is kind of interesting to see Spurs at this point of the table where you think that you know maybe they were going to get off to a better start you one one and one four points and their attack just hasn't really gotten off the ground apart from the explosion that they had in gameweek 2 and they fell back to Earth against Newcastle and you saw those same issues that you saw last season with anges system where when it when it kind of starts grinding to a hold it it it really does and they can't keep a clean sheet so I I was F just the common sense FP take here is all that said Pedro poro is the fantasy option and then it becomes a do you view Pedro poro as a season keeper and if you do then I think he's just a very logical guy to get whenever it is that is convenient to you if you want to spend more transfers in your defense then I think p repor you don't necessarily he doesn't feel like a he's compulsory you don't need him he's I mean he took so many freaking shots I think he I think he took six shots against Newcastle insane if he's taking that many shots it's clear that an has said to him put his arm around him and said go for it my man like and he he he owns that sort of space at the corner of the 18 Yard Box he's constantly getting the ball there and he has the he has a great cross and he has the ability to shot uh to to shoot obviously so um I love any fullback that is that attacking uh so that that's I think that to me is even a more take a bigger takeaway than what we thought we'd be talking about Sun salani Madison Etc there's really nothing more to say there yeah I mean and maybe we'll see a better version of their attack when sank is healthy most likely we will but when will that be I don't know I mean they nor L and Derby in game week four which is going to be really tough obviously um should be interesting match very fun but uh and with no Dean rice too uh so yeah I don't think well they do have uh their new uh signing uh the the Spanish guy uh who is just like oh he got injured too didn't he I think he's I think he he's like immediately injured so just like yeah who's the guy who came to Arsenal under vanger with a broken back Kim krom yeah exactly he he's been cmed already he'll be like a new signing when he joins in November though Brandon okay take us to Chelsea well I actually I'm going to trade I'll I'll trade uh Chelsea and Fulham okay even though fulham's your Club you tell me uh I want to hear your Cole Palmer is like uh wildly inessential uh rant oh okay well yeah I don't I think that that wolves match where polymer got three assists and a goal really inflated uh our view and it inflated our view of him in many ways it was a great reminder of how incredible a fantasy asset he was last season of course how does that mean that I'm trying to force this argument that he's not a good as good a fantasy asset as as as everyone seems to think he is des despite him continuing to acrw fantasy points but he did he did all the dirty work against wolves he got one assist and a yellow card uh in the match this weekend and he blanked in the first week and everything that we have and everyone has been saying about Chelsea remains true about this club is is just in a real moment right now and having of course they're going to be having an identity crisis and I don't think even though moresa style of football is is very attacking I don't think it's enough to bring Chelsea out of that identity crisis so I think I feel better saying saying this today and I've got two weeks to not have to eat my words um I feel better swerving and fading Palmer and taking and and getting picks uh elsewhere with that money I would have spent on him than than to have because I do think the Wolves match just inflated our sense a great Hot Chip song just turned into a great way to manage your fantasy team uh all right I think that's fair uh and now I will I will now take fulam because we did our trade here uh trash team trash Stadium trash fans uh no I uh no I'm just kidding I think no no just just joking uh my takeaway is that um I don't know just that Anthony Robinson is uh Jedi is uh is probably the best fantasy has you okay actually I know I do I have because we talked about him already my other take is that I am maybe slightly I cannot believe I'm saying this slightly interested in aat tror as a fantasy ASA I never thought I would be there brand that's a place tell me why tell me why just cuz he's everywhere cuz he scored a goal no cuz he's like he's all he like he's just getting in the Box he's he's been super aggressive like you know he's sort of I don't know what his heat map looks like but it feels like he's just like he he has a lot of the ball and he's like clearly clearly they have decided like like giving him the space to run with the ball is like something that's going to help them I actually not certain it has helped them so far this season but they yeah yeah it's he's a strange a strange player to be you rarely ever saw him even at wolves like on the he was always an impact sub and I thought that was going to be his role clearly Marco Silva has said we are a more Dynamic team with him and this is our best starting 11 is he's like consistently starting yeah and he's good going forward is he good at much else it's it's really difficult to say yeah uh yeah um but yeah as as like Smith row or uh all these guys are going to be consistent from Smith row to a wobe to a doat so I would I would say if you don't if you hold your nose looking at aobi you should probably hold your nose with Tori as well yeah um yeah I think that's I think that's that that's fair I I actually don't think I could actually bring myself to have Troy he's fun to talk about he's fun to talk about he's fun to watch he's he's he's just a fascinating player in general uh by the way going through this table I'm like I didn't know where anybody was basically outside of the top four so this is this is fascinating um so all right so we've we're we're at Club number 13 which is West Ham United gosh you know I really am struggling to come up with a take for West Ham I suppose Jared Bowen is is this season's version of the good fantasy player that is like too expensive on the he's like on the wrong team and he costs too much like it's like he's actually playing pretty well right he's got let's see what he's got so far he's got a yeah I mean I guess it's just a goal and assist although he's had a couple pretty tough fixtures uh with with Villa and Man City but uh he's like but I just at 7.5 there's like 25 players in that price range and cheaper who I want more than him right so that's yeah I feel like it could go two ways with West Ham halfway through the season we could be like it's all gone wrong these transfers they made the new managerial Appo appointment was terrible or it could be like wow they actually did they had a great summer um and I it could genuinely still go either way it feels like I still could see myself getting suit check possibly on my wild card what a what an absolute legend that guy is every just each of the three matches to start the season same old suit check he didn't even start um the match this weekend and he still comes on and you're just like anytime you flip on the West Ham match he's getting he's everywhere it's ridiculous all right let's move on to Brandon you're next here um with uh Manchester United United and 14th geez slower than I realized well I feel I feel Vindicated in my like complete just like dismay that all these pundits were picking Manchester United to finish even close to the top for The Song Remains the Same ten hog is a terrible coach a terrible leader of men and their Midfield is I mean Mayu cannot a young inexperienced Mayu cannot save this Manchester United midfield they're going to struggle all season it's a really um it's like yeah and maybe maybe the maybe Mayu garnacho like maybe these guys have like another level they can reach out to they're like they're like a baseball team that has like a bunch of good players but no Allstars you know like outside of uh outside of Bruno obviously and it's like it's really hard to like to make the playoffs or win the World Series when everyone's pretty good no one's amazing you know and it's like and it's like is Zer is you know Zer is he going to be that guy I don't know you know it's like it feels like every and all of these spots it's like there's no kind of like there's no no one who's making like a best 11 of the top six or whatever right so it's yeah and I just wonder if it's like and United fans will hate to hear it but I it may be that there were good transfers this summer but you don't have a smart enough person to put them in the right spots and move them around the correct way around the like field I wonder if a new manager appointment Halfway Around uh halfway through the season helps this team I mean if they say 14 for much longer it's it's not going to be halfway through the season right it'll happen like this fall um this this Autumn so um yeah I I I I'm with Pino's ours uh we get to see his first we get to see his first couple matches I'm kind of excited about that um well is he I don't think he's going to be managing the US this break I don't think they've actually signed the contract is that right I think we're still in terms agreed really I'm surprised he didn't get it what he make sure he's got like all the blue M&M's in his you know pretty much yeah yeah let's take care of that before this weekend we got we got like the World Cups coming up U all right well let's let's move on to our final handful of clubs here uh Leicester city uh I you know I okay I've got a positive takeaway here which is that they might just have enough like Premier League pedigree like kicking through the kicking through that Squad to stay up this season like they're I I mean it depends on whether they get um an actual like like let's let's leave points penalties out of the out of the equation for the moment right that might come but but like there's just like a handful of dudes who've it's like I don't know I I just feel like like if you if you compare like the the three promoted teams and S have had a few moments but like it just feels like Lester's kind of like I don't know it's like there's enough quality dudes in that Squad that I think they can survive I don't know like what do you what do you think I I think that I am so biased against Steve Cooper why do why are you about why are you about I like Steve Cooper like I think he's actually pretty he's so corny in every every uh like postmatch interview is just platitude after I think you're being Luc I think if he looked like no you're you're the one who you're the one who mind that guy you like who's that guy you like from Twister if he looks like if you look like Glen if you look like Glenn Powell and I saying this stuff you'd be all over you're you're the one whose mind goes to that I I um but I don't know I mean they have one point it like L luten town was was Raising people's eyebrows at this point I mean Luton toown almost survived in all Hony if we keep it fantasy Focus then I mean how about just Jamie VY right like he might be enough for them I didn't think I didn't think he was going to be uh anything and uh and I mean I'm still not like looking to looking to buy him or anything like that by the way when did they sign I I totally miss that they brought in uh uh Edward did you notice that Edward signed for for uh Lester I kind of miss yeah Edward and Jordan IU so they got a couple of Crystal Palace SES and Bobby deard doed is in there so they're next week pod we can do a transfer Roundup somewhat desperate transfers there I I mean vout face I think is the best fantasy option on this team right now he's already jumped up to 4.1 based on the setpiece goal that he scored uh but still he he might just be unsexy as he is as a center back the 4.0 Defender James James Justin AER he used to be he used to be he used to be Mr James Justin is it is what is he priced at James Justin is he 4.0 as well 4.5 sadly but he's properly rated he properly rated properly rated all right let's move on to uh Crystal Palace Brandon Crystal Palace 16th Place lower than I expected so is is e too expensive so he has been as noted unlucky he probably should have at least one more goal than he does and he's come close a number of times his finish was really elegant this weekend but is he like what you were saying about Jared Bowen is e is the allore of e actually an oasis in a desert a mirage I is the Oasis actually a mirage with a and that's my concern with him is you're just paying too much for a guy who's not on a good enough team who sold some very good sturdy Parts over the summer I mean you're not paying that much really I mean you know you're paying 6.9 million now like it's not crazy given how good he is right like I mean he's taking he's taking shots he's taking a lot of shots and creating a lot of chances that does typically translate into FPL results on a long enough time Horizon right and so I I I still think there's something there it's but it has been obviously like a hugely start yeah I mean I guess he got a Goen three bonus in the third game week so like I guess we need to stop thinking about him as like a flop right like he's done as well as he's in EO territory where he's been frustrating to own but you it's not been a complete disaster Y and then yeah you come back to that question of of how many what kind of results are Palace RIT large going to get this season yeah all right IP switch Josh I switch uh like Leaf Davis like that they have some 4 million options that we could look at long term um I am not really buying the hype with um with deap like I know he scored in in gameweek three he actually was it in the Liverpool match where he had a pretty big chance in the first half too um but he's just 5.5 million and I just don't know that I would be willing to spend more than 4.5 5 million in any I switch players no disrespect to their supporters but like it's just like it feels like they're going to be struggling all year and I just don't really want to have anybody from a club like that yeah I do love Greaves as their Center back and and our and again our buddy James Holland back us up there where gavves looks like he's he's locked that spot down and he looks really strong on set pieces I'm moving I'm moving tonbe to Greaves um as we speak then well done sir all right that brings us to wolves uh and wolves are in kind of a you're not necessarily in a desperate position ever this early in the season but nothing has really gone their way and Gary O'Neal will be very frustrated they have so many uh to you know go back to your baseball metaphor they have so many great you know uh players who who have the tools the tools but it's just not coming together and then you get no fantasy output uh because of that I think what we have to be looking out for is Will wolves form coincide with the Good Run Of fixtures and we can actually consider some of these relatively decently priced midfielders in forwards from like hang he Chan to COA and Gomez and and all of those guys yeah there yeah it's like there's there's like some meat on that bone with this team right um but yeah not yet not not yet all right Southampton tell tell me uh how good the Bron Diaz pick was no I'm going to let you slide on that one I I I gave it to you on the on our deadline a pod and that that felt like enough um so uh there is I mean okay here's my real take and I'm sorry in advance but there is nothing to like on this team I can't remember the last time there was a a a a Premier League team that was that field at a full 11 had players and I can't find anything to like like we go to Everton who's in 20th and a second I can think of plenty of things right like half I mean there's like eight players on that team that I would consider if like with a new manager and a good run of form right it's like but like with Southampton there's there's like nothing right there's just what about ramsdale coming in at at goal he's already had a price drop so he's 4.4 uh so it's an interesting way to solve a cheap goalkeeper thing that's interesting he's going to get a ton of saves yeah he is going to get a ton of saves that's okay that's like half interesting I'll give you that one that's half everything else is zero so instead of a zero to 10 I'll give them a point we're not a spit take territory yet but exactly I mean do you do you can you counter that take at all do you have any like no no um you're usually meaner about Southampton than I am I don't know there I it always depresses me when you look at clubs like Southampton where they go through they went through the recent moment where everyone's like this is the model club like they were what Brighton is now Southampton were a decade ago and everyone thought you know they were doing big think pieces on the back room staff and and how they made it all work and brought players through their Academy and and now it's now they're just kind of like I don't know I'd compare him to like Sunderland like a a long a historic club with a great fan base that has just kind of like all the Allure is is not Apparent at the moment yeah um by the way when I made that IP switch uh def four four million Defender transfer a minute ago it asked me um if I if I wanted to make the change because it would cost me an extra point4 I had not activated my Wild Card even though I had made like 11 transfers already so wow now granted I'm sure I would have caught it over the next two weeks but still it is a reminder when you play your wild card activate your wild card do not forget to do that do not take a minus 36 or whatever yeah because I made like 11 transfers um so uh all right well that brings us to uh our final Club here Brandon is that right we're we're down to Everton Club number 20 I said a couple kind of vague but nice things about them a second ago do you have any Everton thoughts uh Dominick Calbert Leen finally got you know some returns this weekend one assist yep uh their defense I is is really kind of the the warning to Fantasy managers is like past glory is not a promise of future returns pford it's not that pford is the victim of just bad defending pford has been awful as well yeah uh which going back to the ramsdale thing like ramsdale is is in a position to grab that number one shirt from from pord Pigford potentially with the managerial change to England I wonder if that is a big motivating factor but their defense has just been so terrible y it's it kind of does I I I think it's going to be cir stantial with Everton do the right injuries to her fantasy template happen to where suddenly dominant Calbert lean seems like a possible option because right now Everton just seem like a team a story to follow but not participate in yeah I mean a lot they like they're they are quality players that keep dropping in price right like so like Michael Leno is at 4.4 million um even bran weight if he you know eventually back he's he's he continues to drop in price he's down to 4.9 like he was he was quite good even fantasy wise he was quite good last season and so like last season they they got to a terrible start they red the ship they had a nice close they were a very reliable club for clean sheets down the stretch and so I I think that they could still figure it out right um but they they clearly haven't yet and uh it's just so funny because I mean it's what a difference the final 10 minutes that match uh makes right in terms of how we um how we're thinking about them right now because it's a could be a dce ball is back and we just weren't patient enough yeah exactly yeah everything's fine now you know and now it's like is he going to survive the international break it's like now it's just an absolute waking nightmare for everybody yeah exactly so all right well that is uh that's your rundown and um I think we're gonna we're gonna end it there Brandon so um we have a um uh we have another pod that we'll do next Sunday um where we'll cover um maybe we'll cover some of the international or some of the the transfer window moves too because I um I thought I was following it but you know I missed a bunch of 11th Hour things and so we can update people on that a little bit talk more about wild card we can talk about more game week four any transfers you know one or more that you're planning to make um and we'll go from there so um great yeah so once again if

welcome to the always cheating podcast thank you for joining us my name is josh happy to be back thank you to pat riley the other pat riley for filling in on last weeks podcast and brandon how are you thank you for asking josh as always im doing great we enjoyed what our friends in the uk would call a a holiday today i think everyone calls it a holiday you mean a bank holiday but i second guess myself like is the bank holiday the same thing as a holiday lets try not to get into it i needed a bit of a i needed a bit of a breather admittedly josh from the events of sunday i think both you and i were riding pretty high with the game week game week three going into sunday well get into it liverpool is a bit of a thorn in our side you didnt enjoy increasing your rank by 35 times in the the final match of the game week before a two we break i dont want to winge too much because the fact that one match did change the rank so much just shows early season blah were all still very tight things will change come game week four but what we need to figure out here josh is whats the plan like if those who dont have salah whats the plan those who dont have holland whats the plan those who dont have i dont know brian and bomo do we need a plan there yep i dont know about momo the other the other two i talked about it a little bit i have not shouted this out yet but just as a heads up because i dont want to like get in too much we promote enough stuff brandon including our own stuff on here but i did start a substack for always cheating a couple of weeks ago called the fpl scouting notebook now of course were not supplanting the many great newsletters that are out there brandon but this is just quick thoughts from every match right so i did i this afternoon i enjoying these i spent like a good two hours this afternoon theyre great theyre honestly great when you had this idea you pitched it to me and you were inspired by some nfl fantasy content that you were consuming yep where is the very short brief quippy digestible fun email that you can just read with your morning coffee after the game week is over so just a good compliment to the well thank you and its been they were fun to do i was worried i was going to fade after like one but after three i still feel i still feel good lets see how i feel when im 69m overall but so far i was technically on a green ara by the way this week shockingly i was up like it was one of those like 15000 green arrow but ill take it so the substack though is just always cheating subcom easy enough so just always cheating subcom subscribe of course brandon and but lets get back to fantasy proper i it was its one of those weeks where if you had flipped the fixtures id be feeling great right now right as you said its like it the timing is a big factor here right if we had ended with the man like if man city at west ham had been the final match of the game week you and i would be over the moon right about this this miracle green arrow i be id be talking instead of i just got a green like i nicked a green arrow it would be i cannot believe i got a green arrow after this weekend right so its its all about how you look at it for me were were separated what like by one point and last week maybe separated by 5 to 10 points im on a distinct red arrow like i went from 540k to just the wrong side of a million so its strange but i was honestly a little a little flabbergasted at that sala can you share your team with me so i can take a take a look here im curious what sure where did it all where did it all go wrong i want to i want to know so you can see here i started game week 1 21 mil and now were at 1 point not one mil points are 70 points game we rank of 4m it went wrong in all of the like like marginal characters morgan rogers is probably the biggest person to blame here because he and jia pedro were my two transfers i dropped the injured salanki for jiao pedro and thought well this is a uniquely difficult fixture for brighton going to the emirates i and it looked like brighton were going to be held until the dean rice red card y but that was a very nice goal by brighton ultimately interesting writeups in the athletic about how arsenals defense was a perhaps a little shambolic prior to the red card but i didnt feel like this goal was coming until they got going to have chances right even man city well man city been conceding conceded multiple goals for the season but the other teams always going to have chances so its you can kind its like its easy to like rewrite the narrative but it is it is rare to trans because you brought in pedro and then you put him first on your bench which i assume was a like a price change thing right i think he was set to rise and then you assumed that salanki was set to fall he is still not fallen once i salani was locked because of injury who blood knows sure and i i did bring ja pedro in largely because of both salani perhaps going down and pedro going up and then morgan roggers because i started him i thought he i was impressed by his performance against arsenal and i thought surely he would get a return against lester and aston villa just even though theyre its its onans team at this point he looks so strong in the midfield its interesting because theyre the theyre the same price and morgan rogers is the number 10 and anana is ostensively like a box to box he is doing what my goodness why am i forgetting his name the player who was their box tobox player last season whose name im douglas luiz douglas luiz thank you and it may be that about unai amory system that just lends itself to a little bit of freedom from these deep line players or its just fluky but it does feel a little unusual that you would go from this deep line player that was a great fantasy quite because he luis was a pretty good fantasy asset last season and for onana to be in the same boat now and its like but still i dont think i would recommend an nana transfer well his first goal came from a set piece so that one is like not a necessarily would you qualify as an open play goal sure but i am i am a little bummed about how i set up my team going into this weekend but you see the logic anthony gordon has been a differential for me and he got his goal last week which was very useful and now hes traded with esok and the problem is eso is owned by a much larger percentage of fantasy managers and then guys like smith row and cona very quiet diego jot the liverpool player that the one liverpool player that you and i both own was the was the guy to not have this particular game week okay so i was feeling very heres the heres the silver lining i was feeling very bad about dean henderson after game week two and i was already teetering and saying no i want a premium goalkeeper four points from dean henderson feels like he got a 10pointer and hes got a nice home fixture coming up in game wi four so ive gone from maybe strategizing changing my goalkeeper my editorial comment here is that i think you just get you get too worked up about goalkeepers and its like its a real like dont sweat the small stuff thing to me because its just very hard to get it right the difference between a expensive goalkeeper and a in a in a in a mediocre goalkeeper is marginal in terms of the total point like maybe in a particular run of fixtures you want the better keeper but even though theres theres theres reasons why right that weve talked about many times before why you dont want the more expensive keeper right like lets say you get david rya well what happens if arsenal have an incredible run of attacking fixtures which they do in like seven or eight weeks youre going to want to have one of those arsenal defenders right because theyre great at theyre theyre great at hoovering up bonus points matches where they keep clean sheets sleep in particular gabriels good on set pieces ben white gets tack returns but then you probably are going to want to have two arsenal attackers as well right and so and so suddenly you have this keeper who probably has a slightly better chance of keeping a clean sheet than a 45m keeper but youve gobbled up one of your arsenal spots right now that cant be a double up in the midfield or hts or whatever and he also was almost never going to get bonus points during the good fixtures right because theyre going to keep clean sheets and theyre going to be fournil wins like that right and even if you just like look at like just cheer like clean sheet odd percentages right its like a team that is heavily favored to keep a clean sheet in a match and you look at like the vegas odds or whatever and its like there may be 50 at absolute best to keep a clean sheet right and the team that you think is going to get smoked is like 40 right so the difference is pretty low so i didnt mean to go on a little micro rant there i just think like i i think henderson is a perfectly viable goalkeeper pick for the premium goalkeeper i think the interesting one would be allison and that becomes a discussion of where youre at with your budget and trent and because trent is remarkably more expensive than any of these guys and i think then allison becomes an interesting points grabber for all those clean sheets and possibly covering your rivals who do have tr but anyway i dont totally disagree with you and now that the vibes have shifted it was the great goalkeeper vibe shift in game we 3 for me and im feeling just fine with dean henderson what about you lets lets throw your team up on the screen so well theres some big news which is that i have activated my wild card that happened a couple of hours ago i i just was looking at everything that was happening looking at price changes looking at my squad looking at who i wanted and i was like this is going to be so exhausting to like to get there through normal transfers right its its like its such a mess and im gonna get crushed on team value which happened to me last season and it drove me absolutely crazy at the end of the year which and honestly part of it was just me being a little disengaged i think early on in the season last year and i was i was off to this is i think a real a real problem and i you probably if youre as disengaged as i was feeling last year youre probably not even listening to this pod right now because its hard to part of the problem is that when you get like i was off to a bad start i both of us were last season and i was like screw this like i felt like i just was like a little like whats the word i dont know just salty about it right and i think like the problem then is that you dont you like get away from playing strategically right because youre like im just i dont even want to think about fpl for like its international break is here im gonna go 11 days without thinking about fpl right youre not a high performance manager at that point exactly and so in a window like that you might be a 0 56 pr like every option that might have been available to you in wild card is now done right so i was just thinking about it and i was like well i have to decide like before we do this podcast if im going to do it or not okay because i because it was just like i dont even have like pedro the way you do right and so and so i started tinkering a little bit and i was like i just i think i like this team quite a bit better and because you can s save five transfers i dont see as much i dont see as much of a rationale for like waiting for like a rainy day to play my wild card right it was like im just going to wild card and be slightly aggressive although i wouldnt say that im wild carding from like a position of great strength im like 984 th000 overall im doing fine right like its its not like a bad start but like i just dont look at my squad and think like im gonna crush it these next few weeks right i what i look at and think my god how much more how much further down am i going to go over the next three weeks before i can fix it with transfers right and so i think that was what motivated me to go ahead and play the wild card but just before we do that ill share my screen with you and again i know were sharing screens and we do this is still a podcast this is a an audio medium and so i dont want anyone to think that but i think just in general its just that you and i can look at this together right while were of course while were while were talking about it and ill just try to be conscious that i dont make reference to video stuff that that people who are listening cant see so but 77 points in the game week it was i thought like again i f if solid doesnt absolutely go off then im feeling pretty good about this game week right i was going into that liverpool match i was around 300k overall and feeling feeling pretty solid about pushing on and i think after that match i think the interesting thing is joda who you mentioned already and what we should do there its a question i havent fully resolved yet because i dont i dont know what the best i dont know what the answer is with him like i think hes fine i think hes a good asset its its like the fact that david lise has been out scoring him the last two weeks it like i still feel like joda is the preferred option of the two 75m liverpool midfielders do you feel like david louise has or douglas geez too many l diaz do you feel like luis diaz has now supplanted joda as the preferred second midfields option on liverpool well if you just take the fpl points yes but how can we then you put yourself into this position of trying to predict the future do we think that doo jot has had particularly bad matches the last two matches no do i think that the team functions better with without j jot in the starting 11 100 not so it then it becomes a very difficult question of how long of a view do i want to take how patient do i have to be to get the value that i need out of diogo jot and thats just a harder question to answer i dont feel like if youre if youre thinking i just want to spend one free transfer over the international break jota to lis diaz doesnt feel like a worthwhile transfer to me not at all if a step backwards right it almost feels its a little bit its not quite the same because its not as extreme but its a little bit like the morgan rogers onana situation right its like looking at what weve seen so far youd think maybe onana is the guy right but then if you look at it more rationally and you just look at like positioning and right like shots and youre like i you still feel like you want i think joda and you want morgan rogers of if you had to pick two of with those four so but i think i think its tricky and so i unfortunately i think what bumped me out a little bit my my transfers are both bust i brought in concept and smith row i think honestly this is why i have decided to wild card by the way too is i just i just made too many mistakes in my in my gw one draft and i just cant quite solve them all through transfers and i have lewis hall who set to drop in price tonight well see if it happens right the price changes have been a little unpredictable but hall set to drop in price i havent even had a chance to move him yet right because i had to move quansa i had to move inku those are the the biggest ones but even like sun like i feel a little caught out right now with sun i got a great return from him gw 2 but at the moment it feels like i have the fourth best of the expensive midfielders i have the fourth best one right and so that feels like another issue that i want to solve but i if i could just go from like sun to palmer or whatever or even just get sola with like two transfers i i might have considered just doing that even if i had to burn four possibly but its the fact that i have to fix all these other issues still right that make it that make it tricky and so even harwood bellis even a pre 60 minutes not that anyones gonna lose sleep over your youre like last guy totally may maybe harwood bellis too exactly so wait well you were going to say something about flecking youve got beef with flein now a hes trash whole defense is trash i dont know im sure itll im sure when gw 38 rolls around flein will be the third highest rated keeper on the season and i will miss out on every amazing return of his im sure thats true but i dont i dont i like this brighton team brandon i want to continue liking this bright team im not positive i can like this brighton team if i have brenford both but maybe hell transfer them maybe hell move in january to brighton who knows right so so im referring to b no brenford i want to continue enjoying watching this brenford team play and i cant right now because i am im stricken with anxiety over when fckin is going to concede a goal and it seems to come later and later each week and so and so i just want i want this trash out of my team i like brenford long term i think its around gw seven maybe when they have a when they started a nice run of fixtures and i think johan wiissa is somebody that we havent talked about too much but with ivan tony you officially is it did he go to it saudi arabia wherever he went i havent seen any news yet no i think that transfer happened on deadline day so with tony gone and the forward they signed injured until like the end of december yoan wiis has its its his spot right and hes hes a six million forward who is like i dont hes not like the most he doesnt blow you away when you watch him in these matches but its like its a competent team right its like a well coached wellmanaged team like if you had to pick between mooney and vissa for example like maybe its a bad example because v already has a couple goals in the season but theres just something about like i just feel a little more confident that like that were going to get something more out of out of visa right like you look like looking five 10 weeks ahead i like that ambo and visa together theyre like a great duo and thats they theyre like just one of those lowkey fantasy duos where youre like well you could get either one depending on your budget and your team set up and you probably get the share of some spoils from whatever goals that brenford are going to score exactly right and thats and emomo is a little harder to get cuz hes 7m maybe maybe e turns into emomo at some point for some managers right like theres a thats an easy sideways move so those are those are some things that ive been kick i dont have visa in my my squad right now they have a couple tough fixtures coming up so i think hes hes like he works a little better as a later transfer but i will share with you brandon this is like a first a first draft of a of a wild card team so take it with a a big grain of salt i i dont i have not firmed up where what im thinking here i think the goalkeeper spot is the first question for me and if you were making a goalkeeper transfer this week or youre wild carding i think that kappa and like and im like firmly in the like i wish i could just like roll out i would rather take an extra 4m and just get a zero every week right like if that were possible like i just coldkeepers are so worthless in this game i feel like and so its coming down to kappa and dean henderson for me as my as my goalkeeper pick and i dont know im i thought kea had kea had a nice performance in his opening match they did concede a couple of goals but i dont know i feel like he might be hes hes a talented keeper i dont know its youre stretching youre well listen you find me a keeper that you want right now yes if you include allison then yes but right like in the sub allison bracket find one that like gets you excited theres theres no sure theres theres no way to win or lose this conversation youre going from flecken to flecken and that and thats fine on a wild card you have that luxury get whatever flecking you want born the fixtures coming up theyre home hosting chelsea followed by liverpool then its a good coupling with the southampton and leicester and then the fixtures are diabolical starting in gw 8 ar villa city its its tricky it is the question is whether you should even look like i me you want to look in the medium term right but like i think the problem is if you look at it through a i was thinking about that i was like well which like cheap keeper has already gotten a couple of tricky matches out of the way and unfortunately that might lead me back to fleen which like that would be depressing if i like wild carded flecken out and then wild card him back in over the next couple days quote an incredible story you just wild carded the same team you had in gw one just go can you imagine if you just went straight back no i think i might end up with dean henderson though i do feel better about it now that gayi stayed right i think that and they did they did make a center back signing as well and so i think i think theyre okay im still amazed that they let anderson go i felt like he was good for them last season i dont get it either good has he started yet for fulham i probably know that he started in the efl cup match and at that point i thought he was like a dead certain to like start every other fulham game from here to eternity and he did not start over the weekend it was depp and passie again so well see ultimately hes destined for the starting 11 its just a matter when i feel like you wouldnt they and they must have given him some assurance right like you wouldnt he wouldnt leave a starting spot at palace to be a backup hes captaincy material like as soon as soon as karney gives that up fpl captaincy right because youve been youve been captaining youve been captaining tom kerney in fpl for the first three weeks and so you call me captain carney and thats ex that ill never change ill never change i refuse so so my backline is keeping robinson of course i think he is absolutely fantastic and it just like hes turned into such a like amazing fantasy asset because hes now getting attacking returns consistently enough that even when they concede he is hes valuable right hes got two assists and two bonus in the season and i feel good about him at 45 i think cona is another one where its unfortunate that they conceded to lester a little late in that one as well but i feel i feel good about him too right its just a cheap way into a competent defense lewis dunk i think is another one where its hes 45 and again talk about a like captaincy captain center back player right hes just like a super reliable solid can nick a couple of headed goals every season type option so its its a pretty cheap back line and then ive got celba as my one expensive defender the one question for me is whether theres any shortterm value in moving celba to van djk for a couple of weeks possibly moving back to cba at some point but at the moment my plan is just is just to roll with cba in and save my transfer and then ive gone with axel tonbe as my as my four million defender you pick its its like its like the goalkeeper thing right you pick you pick a four million guy theyre all terrible just dont spend more than 4m right and and i dont know like there are like moments when brighton seem saucy and fun and youre like well maybe theres like a match where they just everyone gets switch feels saucy fun totally why do i keep saying brighton i got brighton on the brain youre im counting two brighton players in this team so and thats more brighton players than you often see so youre definitely thinking about it so our friend james holland who came on the patreon pod whos a been a long time it switch season ticket holder fan is hes he told us he dip switch to optimistic as he is to finish 15th in the table youd think theres some points that have to be coming for this team sooner or later they picked up a point against fulam for instance and leaf davis the leaf legends we need some nickname for him leaf legend though picks up i think he got an assist and two bonus in this match so he is he is off and its god if he was four million hed be like one of the most own players in fantasy but at 45 its just a little too much a little too much switch for my blood brandon but at 4m lets lets lets lets toss one of their options on the bench through the midfield the big thing here is i have palmer and solo so am i chasing points i dont know im probably getting like the second and third best fantasy access in the game so i dont feel like that bad about it and part of what i like about it is i feel like theres a version of this like i feel like theres a rotatable like a rotating third forward that i can use here as well and so i it almost feels like ive got a little too much money in my midfield still but at the moment ive got smith row who im holding on to maybe i shouldnt be i i thought he was u just like i dont know he was out of it in that if switch m i he had a couple chances like right before he got subbed right like and that was i think i think what youre seeing was smith row is just a young man who has played his entire life at arsenal at one club and as talented as he is going to a new club across town its its not easy especially for the younger players and hes being a lot is expected of him like hes coming now into fulham and they expect him to be like the general of that attack its going to take time i think and i agree like he looks a little you hes not there yet hes not finished and so he might turn into morgan rogers which would save me like 045 that probably that probably is the sensible move right honestly i could get onana if i wanted but i still feel like i feel like rogers is still is still probably the more sensible pick there but also make a for a little bit less of a benching headache i just feel like its always tricky when youve got when youve got eight midfield starters right that you want to play like or when youve got three forwards and five midfielders all of whom are competing and every single week youre i dont like having that headache in fantasy right well let me ask you this about this draft and we talked a lot about fifth midfielder before gw one and i ended up with a 55 bron diaz as my fifth mid youve thought about this a little bit youve gotten off harry winks you now have your fifth attacker would be sano or smith r at 55 where are you at with the 45 guys like morgan rogers is as low as you think you can go given what weve seen so far no i i think so just because i do think that like you get quite a lot from him at five i think hes 51 now right you get quite a lot from him at 51 is that worth the extra point5 million or6 or whatever it probably is honestly and i think what makes it so just to quickly go through my midfield right now ive got salah palmer e sano and smith row and seano to me is just correcting a mistake and it was the impetus for the wild not i shouldnt say the impetus but one of the reasons i was convinced is we can call the impetus of salwa thats sal thats right salo is absolutely 100 the impetus even cole palmer is like a luxury move that you can do when youre wild carding right but the what was seano not having risen in price even once is shocking considering that like in every in every like way that you look at him i feel like hes been fantastic like he the underling stats are good the actual fpl stats are good and he looks awesome right even if youre just watching highlights of these matches like sano is heavily involved right like he looks like hes even even with solank out hes gonna take on a lot of attacking a lot of the attacking potential and so hes just like a i think for most managers a square peg for any problematic round hole that we have so joe pedro is super cheap for the third forward at 55 morgan rogers is as we discussed like probably the cheapest fifth mid youd want and sano is hes 55 right so y its rare that people are paying enough attention to bourn myth and have a 55 hole that they need to fill unless youre in a situation like this where i just did it last week i got i got smith row over sania but like i think but if youre trying to get an expensive if youre trying to fit three premiums into your squad youre going to need to fill it out with some of these cheapies right and i think the problem then is you dont necessarily have players you want to start every single week right and i think thats where to get back to your question about the more expensive bench option right i think thats where the having a more expensive player makes more sense because you can talk like you can you can rotate them a little bit and so so then my forward line and this to me is the problem is is it a problem you tell me right and so the problem is that i have i have holland hollands not going anywhere and and i just dont care i dont i dont like any version of my squad that doesnt have him in it i dont care how much how many other spots i can upgrade okay like maybe im missing whos talking about getting rid of holland at this well just a lot of people are like theres the advanced stats folks are like dropping him in the short term i dont know probably not before the brenford match but maybe ahead of gw five i dont i dont want to get into it because my goal this season is not want to either you and i are not going to no flame wars this year brandon were on were on a firmly on were were just this is a friendly world were not going to get our were not going to stick our foot in the were the swiland of fpl this exactly were an island onto ourselves and so what i have is i have holland i have jaa pedro who i honestly to me thats another mistake that im correcting i just i should have been on him from well i i dont know i i dont need to kick myself too much because the player that i got was chris wood and chris woods been excellent and in all three of the matches including gw two where he blanked he was good and im sure a lot of people out there have not watched like any forest so far this season but hes been great and know hes hes in this last match he i think he took five shots in the match scored a goal had a brace late that got chocked off played the full 90 minutes i think there was some risk like earlier about whether he was going to be rotating a little bit but hes hes been i think hes been absolutely fantastic so far this season and so my feeling with him now is maybe i just keep him and i just and i just rotate him a little bit and that hes probably solid enough that you dont necessarily need to move him for one of these other options that have been a little inconsistent and so the problem though is theres no wally watkins in this squad theres no theres no eso right like theres a number of players that that i cant have and thats just the price you pay if youre going to have holland salah and palmer right thats a thats almost what is that 27 its almost 40m of my 60m budget in three players its absolutely insane right u the gamble youre making here which is i think why youre making it is its one of the better bets you could place is youre youre taking cole palmer over a second striker youve got two third tier strikers and cole palmer i think thats i think thats exactly right and and also banking that like these 55m guys or what ill just use starting price here right but the 55m guys sano smith row pedro morgan rogers you pick the three or four different options there that those players can be good enough right that they can get you to like a 65 is option be best as ivanka trump would say i dont know what that i have no idea what thats reference to but so thats thats where i am and so that was unexpected i i thought i would drop that on you brand you didnt know i was going to reveal a i had no idea and then you showed us a draft i thought you were going to tease it for next week we got a whole international break to work through but still youre going to see a whole different draft when you turn tune into always cheating next monday morning very likely exactly and and honestly i will say too and not to do a second shout out for the substack but part of the value of doing this is i have been watching match highlights of everything that i missed over the weekend and you do like you do like you dont have to be ready to suback do this but like if youre if youre like taking fantasy seriously you should be watching highlights you dont have to like they always whatever im sure im sure you can watch them in any country youre in right but in like nbc and peacock they have the extended highlights and right and sometimes you look at them and you like h like this is like 13 and a half minutes i dont have this much time but for whatever reason they decid to spend four and a half minutes on the lineups the start of every one of these and then they show like the opening minute of the match right so all you have to do is you pull up the extended highlight you skip forward about three minutes and 40 seconds and then youre where you want to be so youre watching like a f minute highlight package and i think it is a quick way to be like wow like morgan rogers is one of these players who like if you just looked at his returns youre like ah like three straight blanks i think especially in those first two matches you saw somebody who was involved right in the this is why you brought him in but like had a game we three but you just you see things that you dont necessarily see if youre just looking if youre just watching the featured matches and and then looking at fpl results right or points well ill be ill be jealous of you having mosala going into game week four i my current plan is i have to roll unless i want to take a hit to get mo which i dont think i do i think ultimately what i need is two free transfers to get gordon and jot to out and salah for a fifth mid any chance that you would wild card yourself have i talked you into it a little bit if i planted a seed well i dont look at my team and say i see problems when i look at my team but no not im not feeling the stress that you clearly and youre not necessarily feeling the stress i understand youre like you just feel like this is the best strategy for you and i get that what i would say is im feeling very engaged with the game right now like i feel like like im im feeling good about like my ability to make confident decisions right and just like trust my instincts a little bit and so thats that was what is what has pushed me to do it right just this feeling like lets go for it lets lets try clearly a lot of our listeners are thinking either wild card or the price market is like in full swing right now and going into the international break usually theres a lot of action at the start of the international break especially the first one when people are like re finetuning their team and then the market should probably slow down in a few days and you can chill out and take a step back for the middle part of the international break but a couple questions here one from step curtis who has thoughts on early transfers to navigate price rises price falls earlier in the season and during international breaks and john reynolds has said nobody ever should i use all three of my free transfers during this break so i think from your perspective josh you are seeing these price changes and are thinking thats going to be something youre going to feel the effects of later in the season so and you agree with this right i think of you as somebody whos very like conscious of price changes and like the market and i think its fun to take advantage of it at this point joe pedro is a great example of this where hes going youre going to make money off of this guy over the break and you dont you dont have to bring in these players thinking im a im a 100 believer in jaia pedro you could turn just being a two to three week believer in jaia pedro is going to mean you can make a better financial decision with your team later on in the season and especially when youre looking at that late season wild card the more money you have the better so i am for like playing the price market earlier in the season the trick with early transfers in the international break is lord knows whats going to happen to these guys when they go off to their international teams i think im like more compelled to go for guys in the fpl transfer market who maybe dont have an international call up thats true i think theyre not traveling that and its like situational too right like i feel like if you have like a decent bench like if your bench is decimated right and like if one more player gets injured then you are absolutely going to have to like and you use like you use your transfer early and like your team is 11 strong right and like one injury is going to kill you then maybe dont use the transfer early but if you have like a little bit of bench dep then i think its fine to go ahead and do it i dont know i dont think like its i dont think we get that many we dont get as many international break injuries as we think we do right i certainly do its a little bit like holiday rotation right this idea that like youve got to go 15 deep on your in your squad for the for the holidays right because theres so much rotation during you december and then you look and youre like everybody played every match its like maybe pep like outside of like man city though youre probably pretty safe well i feel like weve already given a pretty good gift to our listeners there with the wild card talk but we do have a bonanza coming up after a short housekeeping break here where were going to go through all 20 clubs and

now weve got like critical mass with data information grass test data test we now have real like takes to get us to the next step in the season and i think the real goal here is to do what i think i think especially because were were we have we have two weeks right to do some thinking ahead of ahead of game week four and so theres its a chance for us to like take a step back and sometimes again i talk about like the forest from the trees and i think i got caught up in this thinking last season which was i was letting other people take the temperature of the season right and like when it came to transfers or went to wild card do all this stuff i was relying way too much on what other people were saying right and it was because i feel like i didnt have my own rules of thumb about h squad right heuristics if you will brandon if i didnt have these 20 heuristics that were about to that be a great that make sure that no one listened to this episode great keyword just became a great title for a podcast episode so and again weve already like were like 50 minutes in already but were going to do these are going to be like one lightning round big picture thought for all 20 clubs okay so just like quick thought and this were gonna keep this fantasy focused right but like but just one oo the lightning round is on so lets get going here let me just gna sitp from my i have a rare that i pod with a coupe glass brandon we have a comment in the in the chat from our friend pat who was on last week youre sipping on a fancy you can check us out on screen on our youtube page but what you get so you got what you got my wife turned in the final draft of her book to her publisher and so you played a tiny part in that as well brandon you got a got my fingers and everything fingers in that so not in getting it published but just in the actual design so were just supporting the real talented people in our lives thats what were celebrating tonight so thats thats amazing all right so thats why im extra spicy this evening so lets go into it i think i think the more interesting way to do this maybe i was going back and forth i was like should it be alphabetical should it be table order and ive decided that table order is the way to go because ultimately the teams at the top of the table are the ones that fantasy managers are tend to be more focused on and so i think it makes sense to start there and so were just going to go one through 20 and and talk about these clubs and then and again were going to keep it fantasy focused and then next week well do more of a proper game week four preview but theres no point in doing that ahead of a whole week of international travel and fixtures and things like that right because therell be some therell be some breaking news half the half the league might move to fener bach brandon in the next handful of days right so we just we just dont know by the way i saw a picture of jaden soncho on the pitch on sunday and i was like i somehow just completely missed that he moved i and i know i knew there was like rumors about him moving but him moving to chelsea i started laughing when i saw it because i was like what is hes like the ninth like i dont know whatever i we dont need to get into that do that could be our an our thats thats thats a hard pass too much oxygen has been devoted to the chelsea youre right youre right youre right youre right what i what i think is interesting about it is man utd came up with nothing because for a while there was going to be a swap with raheem sterling raheem sterling ends up at arsenal and man utd like heres who did they get they didnt get anybody theyre still playing marcus rashford so thats very fun for them mason mounts injured now too right so its like so all right so lets start at the top of the table here heres my first thought on men maybe well go like back and forth how about that i do want you to okay and then if you have an extra there have an extra thought we can we can add it but my first thought on man city to kick things off here and first overall at the moment tied with liverpool on nine points theyre ahead theyre head on goal difference theyre tied on goal difference but theyve scored two more goals my first thought in man city is that the defense probably needs to be reevaluated and like we probably my thought is that we shouldnt be drawing any real conclusions about their defense at the moment because the like rod has they just havent had rodery for the first three weeks and he is he though not a defender himself is incredibly important to the defense and not only is he not there to protect the defense but i also wonder if it has forced them to play gavard all as a as a center back right like i wonder if pep has not had the confidence to like let him push forward more right as a result of not having rodere in the center because i feel like we saw a more attacking leftwing version of him in the past and hes hes been pretty pinned i feel like to the to the back line that is interesting i feel like guardal its its just more of i think its less about the formation and the tactics and more gardiol might just be a slow starter we saw this with him at the start of last season and city just seemed to find that like that destruction rhythm midway through theyre a onan fantasy team right now the pleasure of it and maybe when foden is i dont know but at the moment its youre right its its a oneman team and so theres theres not like the problem is theres no value anywhere else right its not like its not like theres a 45m defender in there there is and rico lewis but i dont necessarily trust him with rod coming back right to be a consistent starter right because rico lewiss great cool fantasy value is that inverted full back thing that he does and now walker finally got on the pitch in gw three so thats just like a firm wait and see so for liverpool then its like i think the common sense take here is its the complete opposite of man city and that liverpool are the man city of this season as far as fantasy where youre like how am i going to fit all of the guys who i want into my team and you would thats another you want a midfielder they dont have any forwards so you dont have to worry about that but whats fascinating about this new season with liverpool is i think i was able to talk myself into not having mosal in gw one because i thought arie slots coming in who knows what the level of discontent or discom population is going to be and what we have seen is whether its to do with slot or whether it is just these players being veteran winners is this liverpool team looks like they want to send this version of liverpool off into the sunset on a real high from van djk to salah and everyone in between theyre just like in some incredible form and i think were going to be dealing with liverpool assets all season for the good like so get as many liverpool assets as you can a pronto and thats the other issue with my wild card is i only have one at the moment and salah its hard to get even more than one in if youre going to go expensive it may be that cole palmer just cant fit that would thats the only that if i did that i could i could still have joda and trent like thats interesting does like a 45m defender in cole palmer is that worse than joda and trent like its a interesting question its its close spoil alert for whatever were going to say about chelsea but i do think that its much its overstated with cole palmer right now i do not think that he is necessary for a fantasy team thats doubled with salah and holland okay i think hes and its like i love i have nothing bad to say about the player and the fantasy its the price the price is illogical if youre going for holland plus salah and i see no way around that and that might be me just playing as a template manager but i just think its its true facts no i think its true i think the part of my thinking there was i could maybe do a little back and forth with him and saka right like like follow like following the fixtures a little bit this feels i dont think ive ever heard you talk about swapping swap poke i think we always you and i dont like to say it because its hokey pokei in america its hokey pokei in the uk were very aggressive and were very finger pointing centric here in here in the us we poke people exactly we hoke and we poke we also hoke people we do both so i think its you might you might be hon again this is exactly why this exercise is useful right because when you look at it a big picture sense youre like yes what do i think about liverpool what i think about them is that i want three of their assets right and so that is thats very interesting so thats thats something for me to think about a little bit that would also enable me to maybe get ali watkins or dare i say nico jackson but lets lets lets lets put a button in that for a second lets to brighton and hve albi and brandon theres a lot to say here we talked about pedro already i think mina is an interesting talk about another 55m player i think hes playing super well hes the the right winger for for brighton and finally picked up an assist it was one of those like rebound assist but he honestly could have scored on the chance right and so he was well in and so i think i think the mina is a a good you mean like im not like first name on the wild card level right but i just think hes like i think hes he looks good i think the whole team i just like i just admire brighton so much like i admire like every like the way that they do business while still staying competitive itive is super impressive to me like its theyre theyre like they should be like the envy of every like non top six cl and they make hiring new managers look easier than like most other teams in europe herler is like hit the ground running he looks great looks confident the team looks great and im with you on mta is like moma on the right hand side but for cheaper so i think thats a great budget call i think be 65 or s and mint is 55 so not as not as like polished maybe as yes correct yes i would agree with that mata pro price rose up to 66 okay so theres a 11 savings there big difference then huge all right so were on to arsenal now arsenal the take here is i the take is it changes week to week after game week one i thought the only player anybody needed in their sads was kai hts after gw 2 i thought the only player anybody needed in their squad was bai osaka after game after game we or rya for that matter arsenal are simil so like i was saying with liverpool get them all arsenal is like pray that youre lucky week to week that you have the guy who gets the points and that goes for their defenders as well is gabrielle finally going to get his corner kick goal this match who knows so arsenal i think have presented decent enough value but they appear like theyre going to be a frustrating team to buy into fantasy wise because you can always justify having them and they might not pay you back the way these like surefire bets from liverpool and earling holland might what do you think about saka like three returns in three but its like it doesnt its like he feels like he just feels like such a step below palmer salah and and and holland as like as like the like its like a premium asset i disagree in that i think saka will outscore palmer this season wow i think hes a better pick than palmer okay all right im excited to get to our palmer section then i want to i want i want to see what you have to say there but lets move on to just like just real quick on saka i dont totally disagree with you on the skepticism there because the question remains saka ceiling is its fuzzy i dont want i dont know what it is so thats the red flag for him exactly because its hes super consistent and thats thats hugely valuable but its like if you look at like a luis diaz and i know small sample etc we always have to say that but like if you look at like what diaz or joda have done in the first like three weeks for example right its like theyre not necessarily as consistent but they are like because theyre a little more explosive in terms of their returns it averages out to the same right especially when you factor in the 3m price difference between them right so i dont know theres theres theres something to think about there all right lets move on to newcastle my thought on newcastle is im impressed that theyre in fifth like it feels like feel like they shouldnt like theyve had three pretty underwhelming performances to start the season they locked into a win versus spurs they were under the c by spurs for a good deal of that match but you do i do tip my hat to newcastle for grinding out thats a how you have to do it some weeks y i feel maybe a little bit more optimistic like there are like green shoots for newcastle and i think i think we will see much better from them maybe the international break will be rejuvenating just out of curiosity look at newcastles fixtures coming up its wolves away in game week four followed by fulham city everton brighton its not like a great run be honest mix bag so i think ill be ready to get rid of gordon for sure coming going into game we five and that will hopefully work into my solem move that makes that makes sense so not a lot maybe its just theres not we dont have a lot positive to say because we started out this season i started the season with two newcastle i wanted to have three and i had to move out of gordon at the last minute for i almost did ni pop as well exactly so its like but theyre theyre putting together some i dont know they just its it has not been inspired like you said maybe the fact they havent played inspired and there theyre still seven from nine is says something all right so that we move now to brenford this ones pretty easy its its exactly what we said at the top of the show ivan tony is officially out of the mix therefore you are free to get momo and visa and thats all you need to know i think fixtures are bad coming up so this is something you can put a pin in and come back to but thats those are the thats the real deal thats the news but they and they and they do get better right because i was i was looking earlier and they are i think its and by the way and bomo is now up to fifth overall in points for midfielders like he is he is doing quite well and were we probably have to like start taking him more seriously as a as a buy but once you get past city away spurs away in four and five its a nice run they have three home fixtures in four one of those home fixures that zip switch at home fulham bournemouth everton lester especially if youre if youre targeting in those like visa right theres a its a nice nice run and theres there i think that could be interesting so all right so lets move on to aston villa we did talk about we we talked about onana and rogers a fair amount already so weve already done our v section the one thing what do you think about the defense on villa because thats emory his calling card has been defense typically so what its four goals conceded you should be able to freeze the the top of the table here like you like an excel so that i could see but i what is it four goals for four goals against then for them i just dont see it as a problem long term right the personnel hasnt changed they have lost douglas louise but i just have a lot of respect for emory as a manager right i just think hes going to sort it out they still have emy martinez and so i think its just fluky right like they absolutely could have kept a clean sheet in that lester game right it was like they lester had one chance and that was the one they scored on and so just happened to fall to the goat exactly you so okay so i think the frustrating thing for villa is they just havent become as fantasy relevant as we expected them to be and by the time they might be ready then champions league will begin totally thatll be the added layer of anxiety of whats going to whats watkins minutes he still going to be a 65 minute sub yepa its its hard to say and duran playing so well right i think thats it complicates thing because you dont need watkins to play the full 90 every match i you have seen a good amount of squad depth at villa at the start of this season so thats at least encouraging in terms of what how maybe emory wont have to rotate the starting 11 so much its just that hes just going to have to limit guys minutes match to match all right bournemouth in eighth position theyve got two draws and a win theyve had to grit them out that draw against forest was a last minute sano goal and then an annihilation of a of a complete supporter group in everton this weekend just like thoughts and prayers go out to them and to shawn ds team but does he make it through the international break like its risky its a little bit like man utd and that like where do you start with all of the problems at this club like new owners thats not going that that might be a start but thats going to its a longterm thing new manager i dont know the squad just doesnt seem very good anyway were talking about bournemouth and its the opposite i think bournemouth theyre under the radar right now lest you forget they have a fantastic manager and weirdly a squad thats more cohesive dare i say better than you think the fpl takeaway is what your wild card showed and sano is a legitimately good fantasy pick expect more returns from bournemouth as we go they i know i talked about like brighton being the envy of the midtable or whatever you want to call it i dont mean that in a in a derogatory way but like i its almost like bournemouth are like the envy of like the teams that should be in the bottom f its like they dont have like a huge budget its like theres like not like theyre just but its like almost impossible to imagine them going down this season right like theres just something about the like the quality of their like they have a good coach that its like theres enough competent players in that squad and its its its its impressive like this has nothing to do with fantasy but like theyre just i like theyre like a fun team to watch i think too like they ive enjoyed watching them bournemouth if youre if youre watching or listening we admire you all right we admire you im glad this im glad this one fell in your lap nottingham forest chris wood i think hes been ive talked a lot about chris wood so far have you i dont know how much forest youve seen at all but like do you have any thoughts on chris wood ive never primary screened forest this season second screen or goal rush situation i im impressed that wood has hes hes generated the fantasy point he the consistency so thats great i have i have no quarrel with him great i think the question is whens the right time to get off of chris wood its like youve got the hes already given you the gift now go to a party and you dont want to outstay your welcome i think thats right and i think that he is i but theres something to be said whether i keep him on my wild card or not theres something to be said for a like like a forward who can return in bad fixtures that is not a guarantee like we like weve seen many times over the years forwards like they have a great run of fixtures like hes cheap like surely hell get something in those matches right but chris wood is one of those players who hes not like when they play a good squad hes not going to get a ton like he might not even get a single shot right but when they play a bad squad hes going to get hand shots hes probably going to score right because hes like a pretty accurate shot taker and i think he took five shots so hes hes and the goalie score was pretty it was like the edge of like it a pretty bad goal for who are they playing to concede but it was but anyway so i think that hes impressed i think morgan gibbs rogers has had been off to a nice start gi morgan gibbs white excuse me i got they were playing they were playing wolves and wolves is we dont have to talk about them for spurs is interesting to see spurs at this point of the table where you think that maybe they were going to get off to a better start you one and one four points and their attack just hasnt gotten off the ground apart from the explosion that they had in gw 2 and they fell back to earth against newcastle and you saw those same issues that you saw last season with anges system where when it when it starts grinding to a hold it does and they cant keep a clean sheet so i was f just the common sense fp take here is all that said pedro poro is the fantasy option and then it becomes a do you view pedro poro as a season keeper and if you do then i think hes just a very logical guy to get whenever it is that is convenient to you if you want to spend more transfers in your defense then i think p repor you dont necessarily he doesnt feel like a hes compulsory you dont need him hes he took so many freaking shots i think he i think he took six shots against newcastle insane if hes taking that many shots its clear that an has said to him put his arm around him and said go for it my man like and he owns that space at the corner of the 18 yard box hes constantly getting the ball there and he has the he has a great cross and he has the ability to shot to shoot so i love any fullback that is that attacking so thats i think that to me is even a more take a bigger takeaway than what we thought wed be talking about sun salani madison etc theres nothing more to say there and maybe well see a better version of their attack when sank is healthy most likely we will but when will that be i dont know they nor l and derby in game week four which is going to be tough should be interesting match very fun but and with no dean rice too so i dont think well they do have their new signing the spanish guy who is just like he got injured too didnt he i think hes i think hes like immediately injured so just like whos the guy who came to arsenal under vanger with a broken back kim krom exactly hes been cmed already hell be like a new signing when he joins in november though brandon okay take us to chelsea well i im going to trade ill ill trade chelsea and fulham okay even though fulhams your club you tell me i want to hear your cole palmer is like wildly inessential rant okay well i dont i think that wolves match where polymer got three assists and a goal inflated our view and it inflated our view of him in many ways it was a great reminder of how incredible a fantasy asset he was last season of course how does that mean that im trying to force this argument that hes not a good as good a fantasy asset as everyone seems to think he is des despite him continuing to acrw fantasy points but he did he did all the dirty work against wolves he got one assist and a yellow card in the match this weekend and he blanked in the first week and everything that we have and everyone has been saying about chelsea remains true about this club is just in a real moment right now and having of course theyre going to be having an identity crisis and i dont think even though moresa style of football is very attacking i dont think its enough to bring chelsea out of that identity crisis so i think i feel better saying this today and ive got two weeks to not have to eat my words i feel better swerving and fading palmer and taking and getting picks elsewhere with that money i would have spent on him than to have because i do think the wolves match just inflated our sense a great hot chip song just turned into a great way to manage your fantasy team all right i think thats fair and now i will i will now take fulam because we did our trade here trash team trash stadium trash fans no i no im just kidding i think no just joking my takeaway is that i dont know just that anthony robinson is jedi is is probably the best fantasy has you okay i know i do i have because we talked about him already my other take is that i am maybe slightly i cannot believe im saying this slightly interested in aat tror as a fantasy asa i never thought i would be there brand thats a place tell me why tell me why just cuz hes everywhere cuz he scored a goal no cuz hes like hes all he like hes just getting in the box hes hes been super aggressive like hes i dont know what his heat map looks like but it feels like hes just like he has a lot of the ball and hes like clearly they have decided like giving him the space to run with the ball is like something thats going to help them i not certain it has helped them so far this season but they its hes a strange a strange player to be you rarely ever saw him even at wolves like on the he was always an impact sub and i thought that was going to be his role clearly marco silva has said we are a more dynamic team with him and this is our best starting 11 is hes like consistently starting and hes good going forward is he good at much else its its difficult to say but as like smith row or all these guys are going to be consistent from smith row to a wobe to a doat so i would i would say if you dont if you hold your nose looking at aobi you should probably hold your nose with tori as well i think thats i think thats thats fair i dont think i could bring myself to have troy hes fun to talk about hes fun to talk about hes fun to watch hes hes hes just a fascinating player in general by the way going through this table im like i didnt know where anybody was outside of the top four so this is this is fascinating so all right so weve were were at club number 13 which is west ham united gosh i am struggling to come up with a take for west ham jared bowen is this seasons version of the good fantasy player that is like too expensive on the hes like on the wrong team and he costs too much like its like hes playing pretty well right hes got lets see what hes got so far hes got a its just a goal and assist although hes had a couple pretty tough fixtures with villa and man city but hes like but i just at 75 theres like 25 players in that price range and cheaper who i want more than him right so thats i feel like it could go two ways with west ham halfway through the season we could be like its all gone wrong these transfers they made the new managerial appo appointment was terrible or it could be like wow they did they had a great summer and i it could genuinely still go either way it feels like i still could see myself getting suit check possibly on my wild card what a what an absolute legend that guy is every just each of the three matches to start the season same old suit check he didnt even start the match this weekend and he still comes on and youre just like anytime you flip on the west ham match hes getting hes everywhere its ridiculous all right lets move on to brandon youre next here with man utd and 14th geez slower than i realized well i feel i feel vindicated in my like complete just like dismay that all these pundits were picking man utd to finish even close to the top for the song remains the same ten hog is a terrible coach a terrible leader of men and their midfield is mayu cannot a young inexperienced mayu cannot save this man utd midfield theyre going to struggle all season its a its like and maybe the maybe mayu garnacho like maybe these guys have like another level they can reach out to theyre like theyre like a baseball team that has like a bunch of good players but no allstars like outside of outside of bruno and its like its hard to like to make the playoffs or win the world series when everyones pretty good no ones amazing and its like and its like is zer is zer is he going to be that guy i dont know its like it feels like every and all of these spots its like theres no like theres no one whos making like a best 11 of the top six or whatever right so its and i just wonder if its like and united fans will hate to hear it but i it may be that there were good transfers this summer but you dont have a smart enough person to put them in the right spots and move them around the correct way around the like field i wonder if a new manager appointment halfway around halfway through the season helps this team if they say 14 for much longer its its not going to be halfway through the season right itll happen like this fall this autumn so im with pinos ours we get to see his first we get to see his first couple matches im excited about that well is he i dont think hes going to be managing the us this break i dont think theyve signed the contract is that right i think were still in terms agreed im surprised he didnt get it what he make sure hes got like all the blue mms in his pretty much lets take care of that before this weekend we got we got like the world cups coming up u all right well lets lets move on to our final handful of clubs here leicester city i i okay ive got a positive takeaway here which is that they might just have enough like premier league pedigree like kicking through the kicking through that squad to stay up this season like theyre i it depends on whether they get an actual like lets lets leave points penalties out of the out of the equation for the moment right that might come but like theres just like a handful of dudes whove its like i dont know i just feel like if you if you compare like the three promoted teams and s have had a few moments but like it just feels like lesters like i dont know its like theres enough quality dudes in that squad that i think they can survive i dont know like what do you what do you think i think that i am so biased against steve cooper why do why are you about why are you about i like steve cooper like i think hes pretty hes so corny in every like postmatch interview is just platitude after i think youre being luc i think if he looked like no youre youre the one who youre the one who mind that guy you like whos that guy you like from twister if he looks like if you look like glen if you look like glenn powell and i saying this stuff youd be all over youre youre the one whose mind goes to that i but i dont know they have one point it like l luten town was raising peoples eyebrows at this point luton toown almost survived in all hony if we keep it fantasy focus then how about just jamie vy right like he might be enough for them i didnt think i didnt think he was going to be anything and and im still not like looking to looking to buy him or anything like that by the way when did they sign i totally miss that they brought in edward did you notice that edward signed for lester i miss edward and jordan iu so they got a couple of crystal palace ses and bobby deard doed is in there so theyre next week pod we can do a transfer roundup somewhat desperate transfers there i vout face i think is the best fantasy option on this team right now hes already jumped up to 41 based on the setpiece goal that he scored but still he might just be unsexy as he is as a center back the 40 defender james justin aer he used to be he used to be he used to be mr james justin is it is what is he priced at james justin is he 40 as well 45 sadly but hes properly rated he properly rated properly rated all right lets move on to crystal palace brandon crystal palace 16th place lower than i expected so is e too expensive so he has been as noted unlucky he probably should have at least one more goal than he does and hes come close a number of times his finish was elegant this weekend but is he like what you were saying about jared bowen is e is the allore of e an oasis in a desert a mirage i is the oasis a mirage with a and thats my concern with him is youre just paying too much for a guy whos not on a good enough team who sold some very good sturdy parts over the summer youre not paying that much youre paying 69m now like its not crazy given how good he is right like hes taking hes taking shots hes taking a lot of shots and creating a lot of chances that does typically translate into fpl results on a long enough time horizon right and so i still think theres something there its but it has been like a hugely start he got a goen three bonus in the third game week so like we need to stop thinking about him as like a flop right like hes done as well as hes in eo territory where hes been frustrating to own but you its not been a complete disaster y and then you come back to that question of how many what results are palace rit large going to get this season all right ip switch josh i switch like leaf davis like that they have some 4m options that we could look at long term i am not buying the hype with with deap like i know he scored in gw three he was it in the liverpool match where he had a pretty big chance in the first half too but hes just 55m and i just dont know that i would be willing to spend more than 45m in any i switch players no disrespect to their supporters but like its just like it feels like theyre going to be struggling all year and i just dont want to have anybody from a club like that i do love greaves as their center back and our and again our buddy james holland back us up there where gavves looks like hes hes locked that spot down and he looks strong on set pieces im moving im moving tonbe to greaves as we speak then well done sir all right that brings us to wolves and wolves are in a youre not necessarily in a desperate position ever this early in the season but nothing has gone their way and gary oneal will be very frustrated they have so many to go back to your baseball metaphor they have so many great players who have the tools the tools but its just not coming together and then you get no fantasy output because of that i think what we have to be looking out for is will wolves form coincide with the good run of fixtures and we can consider some of these relatively decently priced midfielders in forwards from like hang he chan to coa and gomez and all of those guys there its like theres theres like some meat on that bone with this team right but not yet not yet all right southampton tell me how good the bron diaz pick was no im going to let you slide on that one i gave it to you on the on our deadline a pod and that felt like enough so there is okay heres my real take and im sorry in advance but there is nothing to like on this team i cant remember the last time there was a premier league team that was that field at a full 11 had players and i cant find anything to like we go to everton whos in 20th and a second i can think of plenty of things right like half theres like eight players on that team that i would consider if like with a new manager and a good run of form right its like but like with southampton theres theres like nothing right theres just what about ramsdale coming in at goal hes already had a price drop so hes 44 so its an interesting way to solve a cheap goalkeeper thing thats interesting hes going to get a ton of saves he is going to get a ton of saves thats okay thats like half interesting ill give you that one thats half everything else is zero so instead of a zero to 10 ill give them a point were not a spit take territory yet but exactly do you do you can you counter that take at all do you have any like no youre usually meaner about southampton than i am i dont know there i it always depresses me when you look at clubs like southampton where they go through they went through the recent moment where everyones like this is the model club like they were what brighton is now southampton were a decade ago and everyone thought they were doing big think pieces on the back room staff and how they made it all work and brought players through their academy and now its now theyre just like i dont know id compare him to like sunderland like a long a historic club with a great fan base that has just like all the allure is not apparent at the moment by the way when i made that ip switch def four million defender transfer a minute ago it asked me if i if i wanted to make the change because it would cost me an extra point4 i had not activated my wild card even though i had made like 11 transfers already so wow now granted im sure i would have caught it over the next two weeks but still it is a reminder when you play your wild card activate your wild card do not forget to do that do not take a minus 36 or whatever because i made like 11 transfers so all right well that brings us to our final club here brandon is that right were were down to everton club number 20 i said a couple vague but nice things about them a second ago do you have any everton thoughts dominick calbert leen finally got some returns this weekend one assist yep their defense i is the warning to fantasy managers is like past glory is not a promise of future returns pford its not that pford is the victim of just bad defending pford has been awful as well which going back to the ramsdale thing like ramsdale is in a position to grab that number one shirt from pord pigford potentially with the managerial change to england i wonder if that is a big motivating factor but their defense has just been so terrible y its it does i think its going to be cir stantial with everton do the right injuries to her fantasy template happen to where suddenly dominant calbert lean seems like a possible option because right now everton just seem like a team a story to follow but not participate in a lot they like theyre they are quality players that keep dropping in price right like so like michael leno is at 44m even bran weight if he eventually back hes hes he continues to drop in price hes down to 49 like he was he was quite good even fantasy wise he was quite good last season and so like last season they got to a terrible start they red the ship they had a nice close they were a very reliable club for clean sheets down the stretch and so i think that they could still figure it out right but they clearly havent yet and its just so funny because its what a difference the final 10 minutes that match makes right in terms of how we how were thinking about them right now because its a could be a dce ball is back and we just werent patient enough exactly everythings fine now and now its like is he going to survive the international break its like now its just an absolute waking nightmare for everybody exactly so all right well that is thats your rundown and i think were gonna were gonna end it there brandon so we have a we have another pod that well do next sunday where well cover maybe well cover some of the international or some of the transfer window moves too because i i thought i was

Break - Improve Your Team,2024-09-03T05:57:58Z,support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreon.com [Music] fmlf okay welcome toone this Walsh you're kid it up today kid it up of the thrashing yeah I mean I picked this up in the UK felt relevant felt like how you doing did you get it at like the Nike store or what where do you where do they we were walking around girlfriend doing all the shopping I'm just tagging along then I was like oh wait I want to go in this store and it just all kits it was just all like retro kits like this is even from like three three seasons ago or whatever gotcha gotcha um no Palace kits sadly but I got my nephew a couple kits oh really yeah I got him a Fulham not not related to me going to the Fulham match at all I was just picking from what they had kid size and then I got him okay this sick ax 1998 kit it's actually so [ __ ] sick I mean he won't appreciate it at all but I'll be happy when he's wearing it okay yeah full I mean you what are you doing to him you might be indoctrinating him unknowingly brainwashing him I mean he's just like in the stage of his life where he's just full kit wanker every day of his life like school put on the messy kit with the messy shorts with the messy socks and his boots you got you got to have a word with your brother all I like Messi I'm happy with it no but full kitted with wankers I wouldn't allow D to go full kidding dude I for it at that age goodness okay yeah come on he's six he's just showing his love for the game all right all right so team wsh team Walsh is doing good doing what's happening in team Walsh's part of the world I don't know DG I don't know I'm just falling into all the things I guess it's uh going wild carded on 96 um read the people of your team all right so I finished on my wildar with Rya um defenses Trent Robo didn't move from that for one second during tinkering yeah Rico who I didn't start with and kind of f fell into after I spent more time thinking about defense sort of like mid Midway through the week and look you got you another clean you just got three cleans there right yeah they just he just did it a different way he got a six point way six points clean no matter what yeah and then I have pow and Greaves on the bench uh my plan is just start Rico every week and when he gets zero minutes pal will come off and that'll be probably fine and I'll deal with it later when it becomes a problem yeah and then my Midfield I have Palmer Rogers Mo bumo E and then my forwards I went with Kai Watkins and Joe Ladro J Pedro who I benched this week obviously um yeah I just kind of I had a lot of I spent most of the week on uh 4 five forward yeah because I just didn't feel like it was I wanted to spend a million there um but the more I looked at it with Rogers it just felt like when I was going through how is this team going to fail that seemed to be the biggest issue and if I had no money and I was moving somewhere from Rogers I felt like I would just be really ineffectively using transfers so I just put jao Pedro in I don't remember what the sacrifice I made elsewhere was I think maybe it was like the bench or something or you were toying with Saka right you were like maybe out Saka set of Palmer because you know you're going to want him and so that was kind of like a I don't I don't remember exactly where the edges were I mean this feels like the team that you kind of initially sent me yeah I mean it was a million so I think what I had was a four five Defender instead of Greaves and I had 0 five in the bank um that was what I yeah that's what I and then I ended up just putting it all in J Pedro and putting GES in I'm so happy with this team yeah yeah so Palmer definitely you know shortterm um probably game week six I'll get rid of him because I do want to get sck in for those two games um I think it's worth it and even though Palmer has good fixtures you know his fixtures turn very quickly after that um and I just you know I just feel like Saka for the home Lester home Southampton backto back could be you know 30 points there and I just probably want that yeah and then uh yeah my plan is to get Holland in for Watkins and you know probably Mo probably moow Palmer Watkins to Saka Holland and some Cheapo is something that I'm gonna want to do in a couple weeks but yeah I look good to save for the next couple I think I'm in really good shape right now and um so how many fre are you on now I'm like confused okay two free yeah Captain bumo so that was genius worked out and yeah Aaron said who's Walsh selling to get Holland back in or is he sticking with his balls I mean like dude are you paying attention while it's just [ __ ] flying right now there's no there's no panicking to get Holland right now no it doesn't it doesn't matter at all until game week uh game week seven and and you look you know look I'm not married to that um because while home Fulham is good um I could be okay not captaining him that week and then um you know the fixtures for him it's it's the real home bankery banker is game week nine there's no if he's fit there's no Universe where I'm not going to have him for that game yeah I mean more more likely than not I'm going to put him in for seven and cap him for seven and nine and then you know reassess maybe I'll get rid of him again because I like not capping him for a ways and for non-home Bankers so um even though he had it this week I mean yeah I didn't feel nearly as good as like you know the home the previous week yeah yeah yeah he looks great obviously [ __ ] seven goals in three games games and you know Brent home Brenham home Arsenal at Newcastle I'm just going to stick with what I got and hope Watkins you know finds figures out how to get his head out of his [ __ ] [ __ ] and finds the back of the net TBD on that but uh big TBD big TVD but that's me one more Walsh question before my team Dr Brad said with an extra week of data would Walsh's Wild Card be any different which I thought was an interesting question yeah I mean it definitely would be because I think then the the Palmer Saka question it gets closer so I don't know if I would actually end up going with sock over Palmer in that in that position but yeah um you know like we talked about we like the the palace fixture for Palmer and you know they ended up matching each other's points on six but if you're going to and then I obviously I prefer polymer's four and five to sakas but when you get closer to having to use the transfer I don't know I'm not sure how that trickles down or how many free you have um but other than that I mean Rogers was worrying um I still like having Walkins for this run you know I mean he still is farming chances he's just not finishing them he still returns has home Everton home Wolves at it switch I mean I know every wild card team I've been seeing in Discord has Mo and Holland um and it's kind of difficult to imagine not doing that but I just I just don't think it's correct because we can't Captain both both of them ever so you know you have to I think spend more time looking at the captain I mean there are so many good picks and when you have you know 28 million of your budget in two players you know if you have Rogers and seeno and you know 5555 P J comes back to the pressure point thing it's almost like if you just made like a an Excel spreadsheet of your team and we're just like who are my greens who are my yellows who are my Reds I feel like a lot of the Discord teams with you know even three mum teams I'm seeing with Palmer Mo and Holland just like there's like six yellows in your team yeah I mean you're looking at like a problem that's a problem yeah I mean these teams I'm seeing are like trying to go without Trent or jamming in like Robo with cheap Defenders Jia Pedro starting every week with no cover and look that'll be nice for home it switch home nfo and then you're looking at it and kind of to me I'd be saying like I don't know if I really want to start him for any of the you know they have home BS like I mean I don't View and that could I could be egg on my face because they might just continue to improve and he is a starter but you know it's it's it's stressful I think and and Rogers right I mean he's don't know if he's he's good IRL I don't know if he's a good FPL pick still yeah we got to figure that out yeah we'll get there but yeah how about you you're also I'm doing great quite quite great yeah 87 I got there the more traditional way than you the capping boomo and sh I just have Holland cap for a hattrick I have Mo you know I was thinking back of like where we were at pre game week one and I was kind of like yeah huland a mo I'm just going to get him and when you think about it it's kind of simplifying the game it's like there's I either they're both going to be doing well therefore I'm going to be doing well and happy that I have both of them or one or two of them or not going to be doing that well and I can get any player in the game yeah it's kind of like the really oversimplified version of that and it turns out they're both the two best picks in the game so I'm doing well um I got another Trent clean I mean he his point dodging is on another level this season I mean yeah unprecedented he's dodging them and he also has 20 points which is also a funny thought I had today that we something we never talk about is like clean sheets as an Avenue yeah right cuz like I had dku also who also creates chances and everyone hits the bar and Y yada y y but he has no other avenues either his teammate finishes across or slash cutback or he's getting or he's blanking and he's blanked every game and meanwhile yeah Trent just rattling off three CLE no problem Leaf Davis MVP with a seven pointer Esa got finally got a goal nine pointer so yeah just fine I already made two moves though um because of the J aention Jiao Pedro price changes so I ripped out doku and mun for Jiao Pedro and E exact funds feel like I'm in a pretty good spot with one free with that team moving forward so I feel good yeah yeah M just didn't work out and Smith wrote too I mean if he didn't get the goal I mean that goal yeah that 10 point I don't know we we could prob we're going to have to spend some more time talking about Fulham probably I don't know if we're it today but that's the kind of thing yeah that's the thing where you have you know Holland and Mo and if your five5 is blank it's okay you know if you're your cheapest guy blank it's okay when they're just scoring 15 points both when they're both scoring like around 15 points every week it covers it papers over the cracks and you know you don't need much from those picks to to still be fine right that's the thing it's like dku Smith throw and mun I mean Smith throw you know very close to blanking all three and the other two did blank all three but one return in nine games yeah you have to set your priors with these kind of picks anyway right like if if I had a crystal ball in front of me that said nothing else other than dku starts all three games 100% for Man City I would have been like oh Auto this [ __ ] phenomenal pick and he started all three and created a bunch of chances and I you know he blanked money is he's going to get however many shots he has in three games I don't know 12 or something like that and a bunch of them are good chances I would have been like yeah that's good that I want that player what if he was going to get zero shots and 12he headed shots Well yeah if if the Cris ball just showed me a head and said all shots are coming from it's like the XG dots on his I'm not sure I'm not sure or bicycle kicks that's the mood special three headers and a Bic 90 the esa goal was a really big pressure Rel though that was huge Gordon only has one return in three games but it was a 10-pointer and I feel good about their fixtures ESO got the assist in the red card game and then a huge Gold Max bones this game so that calmed the nerves a lot with that that pick so I'm like pretty stable I'm not amazing I'm not a wild card team no I'm definitely not especially after these two free yeah but I'm okay and I you know I still like most and you have leaf and I have Leaf so this start every week easiest game in the world so ni nice that he just came in right away and got you a seven pointer it's so huge with a side pass from Midfield yeah but he looked he looked good dude he was everything I wanted him to be yeah yep yep um August mug winners first mug of the year and we're shipping five mugs out this month because of the triple tie in third place Nathaniel Brown in first place AK no mystery sathia AKA Jitterbug on Discord AKA Wharton here's a

right all right that's that so yeah you have to wait one more Rory button AKA ding dong Diogo good job you good job by [Music] you September another three game week month oh rip for mugs if you have chips yeah because of the international break right now yeah yeah can you imagine a world where there's just no International breaks one season that's just NFL schedule style every week no Friday games yeah maybe a couple Monday games but I don't even give a [ __ ] about Monday games no Friday games no International breaks it's just every week There's games on Saturday games on Sunday can you [ __ ] imagine how good that would be wouldn't mind mind it oh God I mean we're on day [ __ ] two of 14 right now it's terrible it's unbelievable it's so bad day one one Jesus Christ there were games yesterday day one I always feel like the first week of the international break is are like among the worst weeks of the whole year where it's like I have to go through all this [ __ ] and then I get to the mon next Monday and I'm like [ __ ] finally okay at least this is like a normal week and I have the same and then I have the same buildup to the weekend and then guess what another International break after game let's you depressing me here with this talk so what do we got going today baby we got games to talk about we got question a lot of [ __ ] happening man a lot of [ __ ] um you kind of mentioned Villa maybe maybe we go there I'm really curious because you watched this game and I didn't yeah what you saw um you know questions wise you know Wolfie basically summed it all up he said where do you stand on Villa assets ahead of a ridiculous run it feels like the attack is where you want it to be but Bailey has potential injury Watkins is low on form and a rotation risk is it rogers's team now I I mean that it was a really difficult game to watch having Rogers and Watkins I mean the first it didn't take long before Rogers to Oly with the oi [ __ ] up was just that was the Le like the story of life of the game but yeah I mean I Villa just I still they're just getting away with it almost like Newcastle similar to Newcastle where you know I mean for them to be on six points is maybe reasonable because the West I mean West Ham were pretty poor gamei one but I mean they were just broadly bad uh this game and their balance just feels really off Tian zonana just doesn't seem like that works to me and you know the the fullbacks are problematic the Bogard was probably their worst player he was putting up he put up a zero he was so bad and you know Dean on the other side is just really limiting in terms of how much he can give you and you know yeah I just feel like their balance is really is really just off and Rogers didn't play well he wasn't his best game he was getting physical to [ __ ] they were fouling and needling and niggling like they were just all over him and you know he had a hard he had just had a really hard game he had a hard time dealing with it and he it felt like he didn't have uh confidence in his touch or just I have Assurance as he did like the games before where he was just taking everyone on and just you know kind of in beast mode so um you know the early injury to baile also moved him over to the right which changed things dramatically I mean he hadn't done that and you know just doing that kind of mid first half I think he was also just a little bit yeah that'll [ __ ] team yeah just not used to it and everyone's doing different things when Bailey does do so much for them in terms of outlet and creating space and you know losing him after 15 minutes was a really was a was a hammer blow I mean they don't have especially with Emmy bndo seemingly I don't know where he is he's fit not he's on the bench I don't he yet he's a [ __ ] like yeah he's just not and then filene hurt right and that's like so all of a sudden they just have no width depth at all you know they got rid of diabi and they don't have someone to play diab's minutes so like Bay's out so I mean I don't know if he's going to switch to playing with Duran and Watkins which he might have to do I mean Matson could do a job he I'm not like calling this oh my God out of position Matson but he could fill in their left wing I just I struggle to see how they score goals really like when they have all these kind of players who want to play more centrally and where's the width what does a goal look like you know I'm I'm not sure yeah they looking at how the Personnel is going to be Central mids like Ramsey was seemed good on highlight I mean but what I was going to say is like the opposite end of this take is like it could have been 2-n in 20 minutes easily like Alli is getting huge chances One V one that he didn't even get a shot off so it does even like you know count towards his shots or ex or whatever the one the goalie fouled him or he ran over the goalie as he [ __ ] up his touch yeah that was a one-on-one and then he got another one-on one off Target and that that's like a Oly Peak olly goal yeah but like you know what you know eventually he's going to score and then you know things will get going [Music] but yeah but I mean like yes those were two good chances they didn't continue to create and have more of them though you know like they didn't really have a good chance after the Onana go yeah and I mean the onal was one of those but they're playing you know they're playing Lester and they rode their luck you know they could have easily went away with a point and I honestly I feel like a point sort of fit most Fair result on balance a score draw but yeah I mean Lester gave them some problems and you know the sub and the yeah it's it doesn't smell good you know from it doesn't smell good but as a non-owner I feel like there's sometimes more clarity as a non-owner than an owner as a non-owner I was like oh my God I got so [ __ ] lucky cuz that could have been an triple return Subs on 65 I'm like I have to Wild Card probably because I have to get him for this run and I'm [ __ ] if I don't have him yeah yeah I mean he subbed on 60 on the nose again so hopefully these two weeks good yeah I mean hopefully these two weeks I I don't imagine he's going to be going to England I mean maybe he is I have no idea but hopefully these by the him yeah get him back up and again right I mean this is a kind of thing where I'm he still got five points you know so it's not a you know he got something by the way did he touch that ball yeah I think he did they had one replay they showed many replays there was one where you could tell many angles there was one where you could actually tell that the trajectory of the ball got slightly altered when it pass him but there were plenty of angles where it looked like he was nowhere near the ball is this there was one from yeah there was one from the sideline like the near sideline I remember seeing I was like oh he did actually touch but um like that's the thing where they you know he didn't do the things or he kept doing the things he's been doing all year missing his chances so if you're wild carding now you're looking at him like like I don't I'm not doing that you know they even though they have good fixtures like he's not showing me anything and you know that could be fortunate or it could be very unfortunate because you know as we talk about fixtures and form and what breeds which you know it's fixtures breed form so I'm still going to just give him the next three and you after yeah after the up switch game I'm just going to reass assin look if he gets me six points in the next three or nine points in the next three or something then I'll just get rid of him you know I'm just going to not have him anymore and I'll get some good forward and I'll be fine I'll get ESO or something you know or whoever's good then and that's fine for me but yeah it's it's disappointing but I I do want to just make another note on Rogers like it's he's he's he's clearly very skilled and good like at things in real life and he helps the team a lot and he floats and drifts he's good at football good touch like good Vision good passing he could have three assists right now and you know we wouldn't we wouldn't be worried about this but he's the kind of player that for him to be an FPL pick the team has to be playing well because he's not going to just be like e and just be like I'm just going to blast the world or I'm going to take six shots in a game you know he's just kind of he goes with the game he and he's influential and important but you know when the team isn't playing well I think that's with Rogers I'm just like H like I mean I don't know if I'm gonna even start him over bumo this week I plan to before the week and I I think I want to try and stick with that because I don't want to overreact to one fixture but um you know if you have if you have him and he's a start every week with no bench cover I would very much be looking at a plan for you know gameweek seven to figure something out there because you know we haven't even mentioned Europe they could really look they are struggling to put a good 11 out right now right now they're injured and they don't have a deep Squad and they might just be really [ __ ] up in like Newcastle War last year where they're not going to look good all winter all fall and all winter like I can they're laying the groundwork for that I mean they're starting slowly and Europe starts you know very imminently so you know Villa's concerning to me yeah that kind of stuff is is not linear it's like yeah em is emry a good coach yes obviously like do they have good players yes obviously but like when is it all going to click no idea you know it could be in February it's like oh they're starting to look good and this is good for next season but like we don't we don't really know yeah I mean you answered one of these questions but the other one I mean was Benji I I guess a lot of people are wild carding because we got a lot of wild card questions yeah they're fair fair Wild Card Benji said if you're on wild card over the international break is it even worth the point 6 to bring Rogers in your team over Winks or insert any4 five if he's just going to rot on your bench and I still think he is I still think getting an eighth attacker at 51 is still worth it so one note on this which I'm a little bit dis I didn't spend any time thinking about this and I I wish I had but I think you just go Adama honestly because he doesn't have Europe they don't have competition for a spot I mean they did they did bring in One Wing they brought in a guy well bring one guy re brought in Rees and and they signed someone I think I think Reese is the main that's forgot I mean he because he can play on the right right yeah for sure yeah I mean but it's just re it's just Rees yeah yeah I don't I like I feel like he's you know Adama is going to be playing every game unless he gets hurt right and if you're never starting like that's the thing if you're getting Rogers you're never starting him then I would rather have an attacking 5 million who I know is going to be starting every game and we have no idea when Europe starts you know over the next 2 3 months if that's going to be the case so I mean I would look at that that's fair yeah I mean mil was really happy with the DH you know he got the goal um which is a goal i' like I've never seen him score that goal before I feel like I've seen him every type of goal because yeah he just like it's like random like I've seen him shoot that I've seen him take that chance and put it into the [ __ ] I've seen him do everything that's what I mean literally like he's the perfect like I show my nephew an Adama compilation in 15 years and he's like oh he's the best player in the world right and I'm like well what if I told you he's one of the worst um yeah Danny I said is Watkins not a captain pick if he keeps going off at 60 yeah probably not a captain pick and the last Villa question was big dunk um he said is is Onana The Villa pick and the new Doug Louise or is it just not sustainable I mean no it's ridiculous he doesn't have pens so yeah he's someone very different I think it was Liam and Discord made a really good comp to soup check Onana good comp great you know you could have a Charmed eight goal Onana season and you know if he does it in a two-month span you're [ __ ] flying but his goals are just headers and like lucky late runs into the box it's not he's not an FPL pick to me even the late run was a design setpiece like like even his ones that seem like open Play are still not open play at all do you think that that note is is overthinking with Rogers about not getting him and getting someone like Adama because of your potential rotation with him or is that reasonable I mean I think it's reasonable I think there's a higher percent chance that Roger starts trickling in with some like 27 minute appearances more than Adama even though Adama also gets subbed every game which is annoying at least he's starting every game with very little competition I mean there's basically only Reese for both wings as far as I can tell I mean Harry wison like he but he's the guy who Subs on like I don't think yeah I don't think he's about to like I don't think he's knocking the door down for like a start yeah I mean the only thing is if he does want to push Hogle up and and play uh Burge like there's all of a sudden there's one spot between a Wes Hogle and you know that Smith row lukic like the other thing is if he's thinks he's going to have an aneurysm because he's watching Adama every week and he's like I just need to like never see this guy play again ideally but that's fair uh let's talk about city um okay so this one's targeted a little bit for you Callie said Walker came on for gardial is Rico Lewis the best defender pick in the game easy easy game gets an assist kid is unbelievable I don't know so funny how short our little goldfish memories are like oh my god um what do you what's your Rico because you were you were sort of trying to push me off [Music] Rico for the sake of depth yeah like that my position when you you ended up with the jao Pedro taking a million from taking five from one of your backup Defenders and you had 05 in the bank cuz I had kilman instead I didn't have pow I had kilman and dunk were my two four FS with Rico because I like Tren Robo 3 four5 and one of them being Rico yeah and my my stance was also I want you to have jao Pedro we were both like pretty a line that like you need cover for this team like having just Rogers is not good enough and my thinking was in a team with Trent Robo Rico 4540 it's a little thin at the back because like you know Villa's defense isn't even good and you know after this run you're never going to want pal to come in you never basically want Greaves to play I mean I have Leaf Davis but at least he attacks and then you know like I I was just envisioning a world where like oh Rico is no longer starting every week and you're unhappy with your your third Defender but yeah I was still high on Rico just trying to find the balance right it was like I just want there to be CU I'm worried that that's going to be a problem yeah um yeah I don't know he looks great he's kind of always looked exactly like this to me like it's hard for me to tell like if he's taking a step forward he's doing one specific thing maybe that pep really wanted him to do that he wasn't doing before but he's just [ __ ] great he's just like a great talent in a bobbing kind of way of just like he's s such a good touch yeah clever such a good dribbler um will he keep starting no clue at all um especially in the hard games probably not would be my guess you know Aral fulam yeah Arsenal those are the ones he misses and doesn't sub on you know yeah I mean the thing that's fascinating with him a little bit to me is they don't have a fullback like him on the team so you know when they don't play with him it's just you know gardiol is the most creative one and you know we obviously remember the end of last season his heroics where he was just coming in and scoring and getting points for fun but he did it in a very different way it's like a lot more like root one or something like or you know he he'll go on maybe more D more direct Rico is like you're say yeah I imagine he's just another year in the system not positionally getting caught out like he maybe would have done last year but the way that his he kind of he just plays he was playing in Midfield I mean he's playing like an eight I mean he inverting Stones Prime Stones rooll yeah yeah exactly and you know yeah I mean he's 46 now but it's pretty good I mean it feels good I'm really glad I have him you know I mean I'm happy to keep starting him and you know like where I came and came out at the end with my specific team with you know pow is you know if Rico is a problem when Po's run ends then like I just am going to need to do something about my defense a transfer a transfer yeah I use a transfer pick your favorite four or five guy for the next 10 weeks and you pick him and I might get rid of Rico at that point cuz he missed he didn't play for four games in a row and he's just sitting on the bench like CU pep changed his mind about something because that's how he rolls or I get rid of how and I just get someone else who has a good fixure run and it's not him you know in six game in worst case it seems like it's just one free yeah which is not that bad yeah that's where it seemed like but it's like you know red rede Jedi had this question he he said with pep not playing foden stones or Walker yet and Europe about to start should we just avoid all City assets other than Holland and like I think this sums up kind of like what we all know is that like other than Holland probably you know Kev probably also is lumped in with the rest not in the Holland category anymore they're all going to get rotated and we don't really know who's going to start and that's a big reason I ripped doku out of my team you know I feel like I got a little bit lucky to get three starts out of him but like I'm not banking on that for three more um yeah and I think that's like broadly right and that's why like you know Rico is interesting because he's cheap and you can cover easily defensively right we all have a fourth Defender that plays and most of us have a fifth Defender that plays unless you still have Barco like me yeah um so it's easier yeah and we won't know this until we see him not start some games but but we are anticipating that when he doesn't start he doesn't sub on you know that it's going to be a zero minute because pep hates subbing he hates making subs period he likes just giving guys full rest and not putting them in that position for whatever reason so if that's the case it it just makes Rico when he's rotated unlike with foden or Bill like b or doku or whoever all Jack Kevin they have so much more likelihood to sub on because those are the positions that you know you typically use your subs more but you know that could make Rico just actually you know yeah he should be an every team kind of pick and he's getting close to that honestly I don't think he's getting close yet I really don't but I do I think we could be about three or four games away from it's just like oh yeah he's should be in he just should be in every team he's going to be 48 or something by then if he's starting some games they still look good he gets another I mean dude he should have he should have a goal I mean he had he had two he could have two but he should have one like so if you add I mean if you add seven more points onto him he's just sitting there with Trent points you know kind of thing and he's [ __ ] good pick yeah really good pick we'll see when the other guys integrate I I don't know but yeah good well the other guys is just one guy it's Kyle I mean how what's gonna happen Stones right sure well Stones that's still kind of barely consider him a city employee at this point I don't know what to believe it's crazy he just never plays he's never [ __ ] picked never fit never plays and then at some point he'll play 20 games in a row be the best player on the team and then Ruban just [ __ ] smacks it in his own goal like a piece of [ __ ] that he is genius by him yeah um and you know Raul said doku is close to points every week surely a seemingly nailed pep wi who and play both left right is not a transfer out and I just replied to him like too late he's out of my [ __ ] team um you know he I gave him the run that he he needed so that's it um and the last City question was just Mor Ari said two hattricks in a row is it even worth it to transfer out Holland and have more premiums I'm guessing Walsh's Wild Card performance last week says yes um it is different though it's different with freeze than with a wild card yes like I'm not transfering him out Dr No it's so dramatically different because if you can't if you're doing it with freeze you need to have more freeze than you have right now to do it you kind of need five four could work three is for the Holland move because you're Distributing so many millions yeah but you know you obviously can make I mean I don't have Holland and I just scored 957 whatever the [ __ ] points so there are a ton of good picks in the game and there are a lot of different a lot of different teams you can make that are great without Holland as they would be with him or could be with him but you know yeah it depends how how quickly you can redistribute and how many picks you have are just not that good right yeah yeah yeah that's it okay uh what game do you want to go next well I just I just want to talk one thing you know we kind of talked about Southampton a couple games ago as like this is the team to Target and then just every game is just more loudly reinforcing and giving us more loud evidence and information that they are the team to Target you know Brenham could have scored five in that game I was watching that game it was horrifying as a nonbo owner I mean they they are very Burnley they are very similar to Burnley last year but like first half Burnley Burnley somehow figured it out in the second half they were shipping as many honestly maybe Southampton will too you know like yeah it's possible they still like that's a that that was kind of a takeaway of the game was like they kind of dominated for large chunks of that game of course they weren't creating good chances because they're very bad players but yeah like it's weird like the Zone their defensive third was just a [ __ ] Feeding Frenzy for brenford they created seven big chances from turnovers there but when it was in you know southampton's attacking third they were pretty good like suara is good Lana came on was good BBD looked pretty good you know so like that's kind of a Burnley esque thing to me is like yeah they would just like surprisingly hold possession and then like [ __ ] mer would like do some dumbass [ __ ] and you know like whatever it is and they feel very similar to that yeah yeah I hear you no that that's a good comp but and that that was Sid's question he's like is bumo actually a great pick or is Southampton just in the business of getting themselves relegated but I think that both things are true yeah exactly like how how many games of bumo being god tier without Tony do you need before it's just like you know factual yeah we we see we've we've seen it with him for enough of a sample size to know that you know he's electric and has all the Avenues and is a phenomenal pick yeah so you know bumo should be in every team yeah after the next two game weeks just like e you know I mean and that's other like if you have the Holland team and you have like neither bumo nor e and you have like Mo and you know then like you know I mean you you you've got Trent like you you have it in different places and you're in good shape but and I got a this week yeah you have him now but you know I mean those are the kind of picks that you must have in my view to to cover over you know some of the other cheap expensive players that you don't have kind of deal and yeah game week six like I'm not sure right now that I'm gonna have enough freeze to have like a a team I'm happy with like I might have to Wild Card in six but yeah which is fine yeah which is fine Newcastle you know go they have home man city in six and then like kind of a tricky run because I expect everendon to not be the worst team in the league and then Brighton Chelsea Arsenal right so that's a really convenient time to like you want bumo and you want three Arsenal players like boom that's that that's all your moves in gameing six so you need to figure out how to make that happen yeah yeah for sure but yeah I mean Southampton you know Bruno plays in this week y early game you know mean I expect at least three goals for Manchester United against Southampton I mean they're rashford garnacho Bruno should fill their boots I mean I expect I expect every attacker against Southampton to filer boots unless they show otherwise so I think yeah I mean I'm seeing a lot of really frustrated people that have Bruno that are like just ripping him out at all costs and I shout to Sammy yeah I I definitely wouldn't um ahead of Southampton I mean he could come in with a triple return easily in this game so yeah I wouldn't any attacker before Southampton bad y yep um I mean should we talk about Man United game we only got a couple questions um Benji said is the stench at Old Trafford enough to make Bruno mazero and the other potential picks of voids and then Vikings said if you're still not on MO is it rip up your team AKA Wild Card territory I mean if you don't have Mo I assume you have Holland so you'll be okay cuz you can still Captain Holland uh this week and you know homeor is a pretty good fixture for Liverpool gek five I mean that is again right that was such an huge factor for me why I wanted to have Mo was for captaining him in game week five because five is a little bit tricky of one and and you know City smaller five for those following yeah um but as far as man united go you know I mean they're just G to finish somewhere around seventh and the players are cheap so I'm not like really seeing a reason toay Panic there like they're not premium assets and um you know the fixtures have been a bit of a mixed bag we know Bruno's underperformed and you know the fixtures on the horizon are you know incredible I mean after the Southampton one specifically you know they have some tricky ways and the homes you know home Spurs home brandham they're not incredible but you know I mean if you have like maeri it's fine yeah just Ben I mean this week bench him and you know [ __ ] Spurs whatever it's F yeah I mean I assume you're not getting him as a start every week kind of pick and I think you just hold Bruno for this week reassess um but look lipo almost scored Mesi almost scored versus Liverpool you know like that was their best [ __ ] shot of the game so yeah and I mean ugar will come in and A lot's going to be made of the Midfield as it should because it's undermanned and they're going to struggle with Europa League but you know they're their streets behind Liverpool I mean this is you know any team that's going to finish you know lower high you know between seventh and 10th are going to get destroyed by Liverpool this year and that's who they are and they're priced accordingly so if you look at them more in that context and through that lens rather than you know they're supposed to be among the best picks in the game and they're one of the best teams in the league which neither of those things are true nor have neither of those things been for years years basic but that's still how we that's still how they're viewed talked about I mean FPL Towers have gotten yeah fans but just you know just Premier cuz we're just we've been conditioned to that reality and you know look their Defenders are four five and five I mean they're they're price just like Aston Villa and that's yeah Everton or whatever right so that's fine you know yeah exactly I'm to I'm totally with you I don't actually think there's any more of a stench now than there was game week one I mean it's all the same players and the same manager they actually made good signings it's the same [ __ ] team if you think they're good you're going to get disappointed because they haven't been good and they're not gonna be good but if they're just not good but if you recognize where they stand in the world and they're fighting for Europa conference League then like yeah they're they're off to a fine start they have a win you know that's pretty good for them yeah let's go on the other side though and talk about your team I mean it was obviously a dismantling performance yeah any change in the I think the Liverpool power ranking kind of of the pick it's tough where do you see really tough between it's basically between Mo Diaz jot soo's behind all of them Trent Robo Kate's five vbd 6 you know yeah MO is still I mean Brian Brian had a question about like Diaz and jota and then after the match he responded forget my question all good attacks go through MO and it's just like yeah like he's still just by far the best he is one of the all-time greats he's just unbelievable looks as fit as ever had the summer off I mean they have seven goals on the season and he six involvements yeah he's three goals three assists insane yeah the hair transplant not having the the sicho Bob Curly's I like a lot but I would have preferred if he did this though and just embrace the oh me too one of us it's okay yeah you're married it's fine they just [ __ ] weird they're [ __ ] weird just are all do you have any athlet uh well never mind but uh let's uh trail that off there I mentioned this I think last pod like there's got to be some out andout Liverpool supporting Maniac who just went Mo Diaz jot in their game week one team and they are [ __ ] flying cuz J Diaz should not be 75 if they're starting every week obviously I think like to basically made them all 75 because they just assume there's just GNA be so much rotation everywhere nightmare yeah none of them are going to be picks y y and maybe that would have been true under Klo maybe that still will be true when Europe starts next week but as of now if they're starting every week they're completely broken and you know ridiculous picks yeah um so how do you stack up those six Trent Robo Kate Mo Diaz jot I mean which three I think Mo and Trent speak for themselves as being well ahead of the pack they're both nailed and they're both the best um like Trent's easily the best defender in the game Mo's easily the best midfielder in the game I don't think anyone would even argue with that um and like we said with the Trent Point dodging I mean he had a he had a goal overruled this week he's created many big chances that none have been scored um you know don't need to go any further into that but then yeah outside of those I mean I still really like jota but he's gonna get rotated you know I mean as soon as we're back it's like efl Cup game and then Champions League game and then more games you know so it might be a world where like I mean I like that you have Mo TR Robo because Robo I think is also safe to start all the games but I don't think it's impossible that like the best three are just Mo and Trent and just get someone else who's amazing as your third pick not a Liverpool player really so even but what even with Diaz and Jo you're in you're that worried about rotation that I am yeah you wouldn't have them yeah I mean what I don't have their fixtures I actually like wanted to look into the Champions League fixtures more but I didn't have time but it it gets insane immediately yeah I mean it's three games it's three it's a game every 3 days yeah they're home nfo on Saturday the 14th and then they're away AC Milan on Tuesday yeah they're to fly on Sunday immediately for a way harder game yeah so like already I don't and Darwin's not going right like he's banned from International games for like six games or something for fighting fans and like you know already it's just like oh well I could see darwi gakpo starting easily at home NFL yeah it's just too scary yeah so for me it's like I think you got your points and you're really happy and I don't think that they're like you have to hold Diaz you have to hold jot at this point I'm really worried about the rotation okay interesting okay and what about Kate because I mean he's been a monster since he subbed on and the last two and half games he's just been a beast he's so are you really worried about him rotating to because like I he would tempt me over Robo on wild card as maybe the third guy because you know you you're you're freeing up a mill like you could show me a team that has you know if I put that million somewhere else when I if I if you have like Trent Kate Rico 4545 behind them yeah could be an interesting one yeah I think I I like that shout especially because we saw you know Robo against man united with garnacho on that side who's just he's just too good to let Run free right so all of a sudden the Robo that was in the Box getting shots taking Corners L just did not exist at Old Trafford at all he was just complet he was basically left Center back I mean they basically play three he he didn't attack at all yeah so like you know robo's trending downwards a little bit because you know man united is not the only team in the league with good Wingers who are fast um the only thing we don't know and I think it's probably worth a ticket to find out is like is he going to go full Klo like Kate can't play two Gam a week and I'm never going to let it happen or is he just going to be like he's one of the best center backs in the world play him like you play Virgil yeah which is probably the way to go like you talked to Neil in preseason right who's just like like what are you saving him for and I remember yeah and I so vividly remember us having that conversation like he's fit like this is the bracket of games like he's right it's like play your best players when they're fit because they're EV yes they're gonna get Tommy John surgery like just pitch um so I'm tempted to take that pun if you're on wild card that that's really appealing to me maybe kante F5 I mean that like that M the thing with Robo is you know if they're cleaning at the rate that I believe they will clean at I'm happy for robo to take the occasional game off attacking when they're playing a good team right and it's the thing with cleans as one of the a yes right and you know I do believe Kate despite his performance in the league so far telling us otherwise to be a donger I mean he could have he could have two dos this year this is the story of his life I I don't understand he he he will score goals event he will he is not they might be in the Champions League but yeah they might be he's good at scoring the Champions League yeah but they they'll happen they'll happen so canate at five cuz you know we we take the piss out of Kate for his lack of availability but when he plays he's so generally he's so good and they bought him I mean he was one of the best you know young center backs in the world yeah and he's just not been able to stay fit for years but he looks right now and we've had we've seen him come back from from injury spells previously and just not look that good he's had some some 90s where it's like oh God like canate wasn't that good but yeah it look slugish or whatever yeah yeah I mean he's playing this way and you know I don't know what the the the subtle demands on the center backs are different but he looks great five million's just Liverpool are just like basically not really I mean they conceded some chances after it was already 3-0 which is concerning for clean sheet but pre that I mean they're just not conceding chances like header right was yeah like half chances bicycle kicks like a header from a corner whatever but like you know in all three games it's just like the defense just looks really good so yeah yeah I I like that shot yeah yeah Liverpool good what about uh what about Newcastle yeah we got to talk about Newcastle um you know Josh me and slim asking is Gordon to bumo the easiest transfer of your life pyob said is Gordon to Diaz time or do we keep him for wolves and Fulham um and Ja also just saying how do we feel about esok now and PIR do if you have to sell one to afford Saka to Mo which one goes or both of themselves and I'm just like so opposite of every single one of the questions I feel really fine with Newcastle and am I crazy am I am I blinded I think maybe a little bit I think you should be a little bit more concerned than you are currently um especially that the next four fixtures or threeways in home man city um you know A lot's been made of their home away form splits I think probably more overblown than anything and also they it's been talked about because that's true right I mean they've been pour away for a while you know for months and months and months and months so while the away fixtures aren't that grueling or or difficult on paper you know they seem to make every away fixture difficult I mean they went to Bournemouth and got [ __ ] destroyed we talked about the team that they played in that game but look I mean they were playing home Spurs and you know they they somehow got the three points but it wasn't like a convincing performance right by any stret but where are you I mean why because you just feel like these two players are such tried and true tested FPL assets and that they're just going to score a couple goals and they're going to be involved in these games kind of an interesting I mean it it was interesting and wasn't interesting at the same time the Spurs game because it was classic and Spurs I mean Spurs since game of five last year they dominate the ball they get high turnovers they tilt the field and guess what they concede big chances yeah don't create any big chances yeah and they don't create big chances and you know Esa gets a tap in he hits the bar on some [ __ ] freak shot that was really strange that was insane I don't even know what the hell that was he got another pretty decent chance um you know Gordon took Seven Corners and indirect freeze and created chance I'm just like to me I just saw like if these are still the same guys they're maybe they haven't clicked yet to the same level they were clicking at the end of last year that's for sure right fours and fives like every other game week but I didn't see anything that was like very alarming with either of two players and I think it's a team that's getting better Char's back tali's back you know maybe some guys look at fit Barnes starting I think was a huge Improvement for the team um and yeah I mean the Away Home Away thing I just feel like you know wolves are a bottom five team Fulham are you know whatever 13 team yeah and like I'm those are just good enough for me and then I'm probably G to get rid in six that's kind of just where I'm at yeah yeah that's reasonable I mean [ __ ] getting hurt again is just comedy I'm really curious about what's going on with trips because I wonder if he's going to Saudi or like gala's just gonna buy him or something because like there was a lot of noise about him wanting to leave and he didn't leave but he's there he should be definitely starting over livero I mean definitely like it's not even a [ __ ] close call and he played zero minutes so yeah I wonder what's going on with that but because to me like the balance like when they have trips and they have that outlet on the right and they can kind of shift over and like have create this tilted field I mean they've been doing that for years and they've never not done that since Edwards arrived actual and you know they might just also be having a hard time kind of coping with that but he was their entire like ball progression their hub for every created chance so yeah you know and there's a bit of a learning curve there you know like and you know someone like sha is you know he's not trips but he's a really good passer and like him coming in will definitely change how they build up and move the ball forward and tanali will too so yeah I don't know what the hell's going on there but I I still just think it's a team on the up who's you know not playing Champions League fixtures soon and you know these guys are nailed and playing well so their their fixtures this season are really difficult like they don't really have any super awesome prolonged runs like they have all these like really difficult fixtures spliced between like a good one with some awkward ones and yeah I mean like you're talking about right they have the the these two good games even though they're away and then you know think Chelsea Arsenal back to back and then yeah I don't know they're they'll be interesting but you know we we have to just give them time because because the one game a week is going to be such a huge deal this year and you know there are only about four or five teams in the league that have the one game a week where you know I think we do need to pay a lot more close attention to see like getting players like Bowen you know aention can't stop shout out to Bowen you know these guys like Gordon you know who just play one game a week if you're what if what you're talking about your fears about the Liverpool players borns true like jot Darwin gapo K they start rotating and um you know if guess what Gordon and Esa play 90 every single week yeah like if you're getting 180 in three games from Diaz versus 270 from Gordon it's not close and and 180 assumes he's like maybe starting three and getting subbed or starting two you know like it could be worse than that also three yeah right right yeah yeah yeah um so it's interesting to to just monitor it for this at this point that's where I'm at it's like they haven't been great they've been okay and okay with some returns is good of and we forget the red card right the red card is so huge we J yeah cuz they if they scored four in that game we're like oh yeah which they should have every other team [ __ ] does probably would have um you know so that that also changes everything and that's also why like es Gordon are even in our teams right it like that game was like a big emphasis point so yeah yeah tough one to evaluate that's fair should we jump to some questions maybe yeah let's do some questions let's see what we got here Harley boys triple up of Mo Holland Palmer plus a premium Defender is perfectly viable with all the cheap options out there is there any reason we shouldn't have all of them and Ure we always have one of the best Captain options for every week and then Jitterbug and Brent followed up and said I'm on wild card is it stupid to not have Mo and earling at this point I guess we already touched on that with earling yeah um I mean I think the three premium teams I've seen I haven't liked any of them um you're just going to be giving points back in defense I think and it's usually not a thing right isn't like I feel like big at the back is similar to thrum and in that it comes up at some point every single season and usually my thinking is like doesn't that never [Music] work yeah usually not I mean especially when one of the thums is 15 million and the other one's 12 and a half 10 yeah instead of 10 and 11 and 10 also then it's like okay we could maybe like if you're if you're trying to jam in Saka Palmer and mo it's like a no it's like yeah you you can get there and then your defense is still good your team still looks good you know it's but the other thing too when I was wild card tinkering was like I did feel like the pool is very small of players that I actually wanted in certain price brackets um like other than jao Pedro there wasn't a single forward that I felt really good about under 75 you know salanki might fit that mold soon and Mata has been a little bit off the boil and we've had some tough games you know he might if we clicking a gear he might fit not right now um you know oi even he has question marks I mean Kai is obviously an incredible pick and then you have um ESO who's you know we talk we're talking about the fixtures being very diff difficult to interpret you know you can kind of choose your own narrative there but you know all of a sudden we're just they're not that many forward picks like the mid-price midfielders like I'm not too I don't like love wanting like Gordon right now if you're just buying from anyone in the field so it's like other than bumo and E I'm like I don't really want anyone there you know in the cheap mids I'm like I love seeno love Rogers don't love anyone else there so and even them it's like even Seena like start every week like they have some tough ones you know I don't really know but like being able to sprinkle around the brackets like instead of having to go double or emphasize in anyone like yeah cuz if you have less premiums then you're then you're leaning more on like well you have bumo and E and Diaz and jotto you know I mean you got to think of it like a depth chart you know what I mean like you got to think of like here's my 75 that I like the most and there's this guy this guy this guy behind him and that's like your guys you can easily get to if this doesn't work out and then as you go down the list you don't want two five FS because there's [ __ ] no one behind them that's good and you don't want any of them and they might both be bad you know the trickle Downs hurt hurts your team and I mean the the other aspect is with Trent and Robo I mean it's not having them just feels bad like they're just so attacking and the defense is going to keep cleans and like I don't I just don't think that's good and it's it's also right we're talking about like oh Palmer Mo Trent could have 40 points right now and that would be like oh yeah that's very much in line with what I've been watching and he has 20 which is still like the most or whatever right so I just feel like Trent imbalances it a lot because there's the other world where you just go four fives defense right and you just go put it all in ATT tag you have three them like whatever you have no Keepers aren't getting bones [ __ ] them all no Rya you just go four five4 a goalkeeper five four fs and you're just rotating whoever and then you're looking at okay well now I I can really make up the points cuz I have all these premium attackers I'm not compromising anywhere it's just like the defense and you know I mean I didn't spend time doing that because I just you know I was just so want I wanted Trend Robo so much and I like the sevens and I like the way the balance looked but if you are that hellbent on going with Mo and Holland I would look at that you know I mean that might beable I mean that's the that's the upside of like a good game with good priced assets is that like I think that that's very viable you know and there's not like there's no four five that's on a top defense obviously right or we all have them well Rico yeah R but um but there there's definitely rotations that exist where you're like only starting them in home teams against the bottom 10 or whatever and like that can make a team good enough to start and maybe those six pointers that trickle in are going to be less than Trent 12p pointers but you get you know exactly like you said you're making it up in other ways so yeah I think it's possible I think it's possible um cie and jam asking about Munoz is it worth holding Munoz or shifting to someone like Rico Lewis comes up again should have put r on the [ __ ] thumbnail holy [ __ ] yeah you know you can't do anything here before before Lester but it's just the right side without Alis it's not the same um he's attacking he is up and down like his his Fitness and his work rate isn't in question but it's I I've been thinking about this a lot because it's like why does Munos look so much worse and the answer I think is simply that ois is so insane that like they had to do so much and double him and worry about him so much that Munoz was in space in the final third constantly and he's always available right like whenever M get the ball the game is so easy because oh there lay it off so easy and this amalgamation of [ __ ] Edward I mean kamada had he decent end of the game but he was he had a really rough game um against Chelsea but you know not playing with one of the Best Wingers in the world surprise like impacting our team worse team and our right side and it's concerning so I don't think Munoz is that great of a pick I think you definitely just want to play him for last year I wouldn't be doing anything with him this week but um you know unless if SAR starts doing bits but even with kamata I mean nether of these players I mean SAR might have a bit more Pace OB has more Pace than kamata but you know for Muno what he was we were seeing from him last year with ois he was overlapping underlapping making back post runs when the ball's progressing on the left side and breaking out there because we were transitioning faster and you know now we're just kind of like dodgy stagnant slower football with like triangles breaking down and you know we've had a really hard start a lot of our players are getting poached heads returned you know okay we know who's here now I expect us to improve but that that was going to be my like I actually we bades we have bad pictures so yeah we have United Everton Liverpool at nfo which isn't an easy one Spurs I mean those are not like not great clean she oh yeah let's just let me just keep running Muno out here like hopefully they figured it out you know I mean we have to be playing well for that to look good like where we could maybe keep a couple cleans and so yeah I think he's a cell it's long and short of it yeah I saw I felt like that second half against Chelsea I was like yes they're starting to click like Palace has showing me something here but yeah I hear you I yeah a lot depends on like how these new center backs settle like is is you know is Chala just going to be [ __ ] great and you know the defense like is dor coming in for Hughes and like they just look great cuz dor is so much better than him in every way you know well lroy also be good yeah lroy so you know I don't know but yeah I I hear you it's probably right yeah kamada is concerning to me he's been it's nice that they have Lester because you could just wait just wait a week roll a week yeah yeah Kam's concerning yeah he's just played badly you know he's just been bad um pretty simple as he's just been bad and I don't know if it's the physicality cuz it shouldn't be the tactics he knows everything under he play with glasner for months and months and years right but he's just been off it like yeah he's just been so uninfluential um and I'm I'm also kind of surprised at how slow he has been to give SAR minutes like even just subbing him on came on and looked good yeah he looked good but I feel like he's subbing him on like really late and you remember for MATA which was weird yeah I mean mata's yeah I mean I remember when SAR was at Watford he was having some issues with just like picking up what he was supposed like tactics and stuff like intelligence related St I remember yeah I mean that where it was like he was like doing I think back when they had mil or I don't know who I don't know I mean he had I'm sure when he was at Watford he had 12 managers but I remember like reading some stuff about that where it was like sar's like football IQ or something it's like what I'm not sure about that but I mean it just I just kamada on the right and I just want him to play are there like it's just kamada coming in and it's it's so slow and I don't know you know that treat that's just uh dudes can literally just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time which is so true we've been doing that our whole lives I mean it's fun to just look at like oh who's on that like 1920 Watford team it's just like 1920 yeah well 19 sl20 2019 2020 you know s Wells J Pedro deie Brito they just have all these weird guys you know the the Greek fallback oh yeah Halls yeah Jerry D was on that team oh god dude like they dor is on that team yeah some Lads so many guys yeah holes oh my God had so many H bosses yeah um all right so yeah we're we're a bit of a mess still but we we did play a little bit better second half I think you guys will get better I I believe still so do I get better figure no problem with him do you really okay yeah think he's good I'm glad we got him because we needed some competent player who's not [ __ ] Klein who can play center back so I'm very happy to really well I think um yeah let's squeeze in a lifestyle question here before we go back to fpl arnest lot said for Walsh if you you were the Sorting Hat what Hogwarts house did you put aan in I think I think Al's a Gryffindor honestly wow is that good what does it mean I don't even know Harry Potter's Clan Harry Potter well all of them are in Gryffindor yeah yeah the main main character Vibes thank you yeah I mean it's it's just cuz I you I think that the to me the biggest thing with griffindor are just like leaders and I think that that's kind of what you're like so thank you D that's it I appreciate it yeah um when are we going to do the second when's the second yeah well it is international break so it's a good time to watch a [ __ ] movie maybe I'll watch it this weekend okay I mean can you actually tell me if you do can you tell me because then I will rewatch it yes I'll definitely alert you don't surprise me on this one okay I won't yeah okay get you ready with questions and what not um whis and did we got a I forgot to tell you we got like the we had the Mets had a remember I told you I got all that Mets gear from the guy who works with the team one of them was like a Harry Potter Mets crossover where you got a scarf and it was one of the houses and like you didn't know what it was until you opened it so it's like one so the colors were different based on the house colors for the um Harry Potter but like Mets insia no so like it had the Mets Insignia on all of them on one half and then the backside had the Harry Potter house and we got Ravenclaw house did you get oh Ravenclaw Ravenclaw yeah they're like the smart party pants house oh nice yeah I could see that yeah what which characters in Ravenclaw which that I know Chang oh no I don't think you know any of them they don't there's no ravenclaws in it there I mean there have to be but they don't really like open up the other houses to the characters okay okay mainly just slyther yeah yeah the the heel and the yeah what's the non- heal what do you call it I forgot okay heel and the uh [ __ ] what is it Gast where are you yeah we G he's screaming right now it's a [ __ ] uh whisker said is Kai good enough to cover for Saka Kai's good he's good but I me what is the question I don't understand this question what does coverage mean what does that what does it mean does coverage mean if I have get the same and I don't have his teammate who's a better pick and that's why he's more expensive then I'm fine because that that's not fine but I I just don't really know what it means I don't know what it means he's not cover because they both are G to score a lot of points in hom lesser home Southampton yeah in gaming six and seven so no I guess that's my answer no yeah I mean I to me it's like the coverage ideas you know know I'm not going to Captain them are they going to get roughly the same points so I can get a cheaper lesser owned player to to kind of be equivalent to the other guy and I don't know I mean they're just both great but Kai's Kai's so good dude yeah Kai because of his price and mainly because of his position better I would prefer if I could only have one and then build the rest of my team I 100% it's Kai because MO exists and Palmer exists and there's other really good mids but there's very few good forwards and Kai's actually underpriced and Saka is just appropriately priced matters that's fair yeah that's there also also I wanted to mention this no pensas here yeah there's like there's no pens I think it's probably one of those things where they're like oh we're gonna make a [ __ ] stand cuz we're a [ __ ] referee Union or whatever and then three months from now it's like a pen every week cuz they're just like correcting their dumb [ __ ] there's been two pens far two pens in Three G so there's 30 games and there have been two pens that's [ __ ] up that's [ __ ] insane that's absolutely one was Holland and the other was who was the other one hack uh yeah yep y yep yeah it's that's crazy especially early in the season you expect I always expect more pens in the beginning of the Season cuz yeah I mean random [ __ ] call whatever like yeah Sam Sammy stack said because of the five transfer rule there's less reason to make moves every week as rolling is always an option I'm curious to hear your thoughts on moving aggressively and using transfers when we don't necessarily need to versus being patient and waiting for certain assets to pick it up yeah that's a good question I mean I've been thinking about this too like well I mean not wild card but just looking at people like oh I have to get three I have to get four to get like oh I just can't do anything till I get five it's like I think we might be a little bit over correcting on that front right how many points do you get when you reach five transfers is it 100 mystery chip if you got five transfers you get 100 extra points like I think that's going to Happ you get like a [ __ ] Xbox Live reward you get a stress ball for it because then maybe priorities would change but yeah it's like balancing this notion of having you know four transfers or using two to dramatically improve your team if you can dramatically impr dramatically improve my team for 500 Bob like I think you need to scrutinize a little bit more because like you're it's kind of like what we're talking about Kate like you're saving them for what like to still use them on these same players or is it like I want to buide my time because there's one or two bad fixtures and then it's a sea of green and I really want to use these transfers on these three players or something but like are you thinking about saving five transfers to literally just be okay I'm making five moves now or are you doing it to like like what what's the point I think we like I get another wild card if I get to five because I get to Wild Card actual wild card and then still have five but it's like but if you actually wild card I assume your team is a [ __ ] disaster you just you just need three or something yeah exactly like I think even wild carding like you coming out with two frees after wild card in in because you almost always I mean I don't think either of us have basically ever made a move straight the week after wild carding yeah something very insane would even wild card you have two free you save you have three free like that you're in a great [ __ ] position you're in incredible position right there yeah because I mean I don't think the goal is get five and then start making a single transfer and Float like you're not improving your team if you're doing that so like it it does come I think you know the planning matters a bit more this year where you need to really look at you know these are the these are the three or four players that I want to move and I want to do it this way and like that's where the depth you know matters a lot because you don't want to have to you know like for my team right like if as a picked up a knock I would just hold him you know and I have Rogers and Ja Pedro or something but yeah if you're if you're looking at your team and you have po you know PO is a bank you're like oh yeah I'll just whatever yeah yeah but like you know that's where I feel like you want especially with Europe starting off like you want to still be in position to save but if you have someone like like you you know you have Gordon right and you're happy with him right plenty of people have Gordon not happy with him it's like well if you're going to hold him for two away fixtures that you're not sure about how he's going to perform ahead of Man City and then a bad run versus like don't get four free and just get bumo or bum's bad he has two get yeah just get yeah like E's strictly better for the next two and then he's a better asset long term as well so and like yeah it's like you're going to then wild card in six or seven and as is going to be in your team and Gordon's not so like you just make it sooner than later yeah I agree with that I mean I've just ripped Mooney and doku out of my team on a Sunday for that exact reason I'm like I don't want them longterm I don't really trust them shortterm I think the guys I'm getting in are better shortterm right J Pedro's home if switch home nfo you know as is home Lester home man united at Everton like I'd rather have them um than just save and squint and be like yeah but mun is Home West Ham it's like just [ __ ] make your team better get more points yeah yeah it's interesting because it is very like the saving situation and taking hit I mean no one's taking hits really like very rare yeah you probably should not be ever yeah and I mean I think that you know it makes sense because say having all these Bank transfers like if you're just planning and getting safer guys then you know you can do it without but yeah yeah I mean there's going to be some type of like the game's going to going to correct itself and you know this new rules introduced and I think as a community or Like Us in serious FP air quot serious bro I think over in to one side where it's like you should be saving under mostly all circumstances where it should probably instead of be that like that's like at a nine it should probably be more like out a six where it's like you should save but no different than last year like when you could get two you know like yeah it's like every year we've ever played flpl saving is great yeah if you can afford to save but we set our teams up differently because we couldn't get five frees so we didn't have depth didn't have we had [ __ ] fires all over the place because we're trying to H roll right so it's different yeah interesting game game the interesting stand it was cool to see three free transfers on my team before I used two of them and I'm back to normal one free but it was you had your fleeting you had your fleeting moment that was cool yeah um let's see not that many more questions as sheer said out of Kai and esak which one should make way for jao Pedro so funds can be released for Salah and Midfield I mean I just trust Kai so much more trust the te yeah and also like I'm assuming you know if I'm wild carding in six then I'm keeping isach over Kai but you kind of have other scenario yeah any other scenario I'm keeping Kai because I know he's great I know the team he plays for is great and I know I want him in six yeah um yeah I think that's just basically it yeah um oy said oh yeah I'm asked us cuz we didn't talk about him is porro startable versus Arsenal or a transfer out if we don't have another good Defender to start do we bench porro um I think he gave you a really good idea against Newcastle I mean he's just GNA Farm shots that are low XG and he could bang any one of them but yes you know they're not going to clean and right yeah exactly I mean what he showed me in his one pointer against Newcastle is that like I can start this guy any week don't care creates chance takes set pieces and takes [ __ ] six shots like get in my team yeah absolutely and you know you you know you were lucky enough or not lucky you were fortunate enough to be able to have your team set up so you could bench him in Newcastle bench yeah yeah and you're going to start him in Arsenal right you're not going to play [ __ ] NFL against Liverpool so but but then you're looking at a wide birth where you know you don't have any home Bankers for a while I mean I don't think home brand as a home banker honestly this year but no they're they're good yeah but they could clean two of the next five you don't know which two of like home Brenham at United at Bren at Brighton home Western at Palace like you could tell me there's two clean sheets there and be like yeah you know which two 20 rolled literally any of those I have no [ __ ] idea no clue and he start you just start him all those games and you're midt defense just like Billa playing mid-table teams playing mid-table teams and he takes [ __ ] a million shots pieces yeah he's like a five5 leaf Davis yes but his team's a little better well probably more than a little better they're better they're better but yeah I mean he's still great great pick yeah absolutely yeah I am I don't like not having him after watching that game I'm just like I want I had teams where I kept him but I mean Rico just kind of turned my head a little bit too much but it was SC watching him even with him first on my bench like I was just like oh God is he about to brace like am I [ __ ] um Flo said what four or five defense can you have in your team without a transfer for the next eight game weeks very specific but let's just call it longterm I guess yeah I mean Villa was one shed I I but I mean I I wish I had Leaf Davis not just because this happened just recently but I just still feel like Villa [ __ ] like I don't three yeah like I have three Villa players like how did I get here like I I don't know what happened I mean bright you were very close to dunk I mean I think Brighton's but they don't have good pictures well they have home TR nfo before a bad run that also includes home yeah talking about eight right start every week it's definitely not a start every week yeah it's fair um Chelsea you know they have some good ones you know a few they have good good for the next four yeah they really only have like one really bad one yeah I mean even like like uh Brenham you know they have these two bad ones but then they have six good ones so yeah you know the the question is tough CU eight start every week for eight is hard for long time and that's why I go back to Villa you know rate them or don't rate them it's just the picture are just absurd and they're just like that this most teams won't have a run this long and good all season right home Everton home Wolves at EP switch home man united at fham home Bournemouth yeah that's not eight but it's pretty [ __ ] close yeah it's good I mean I think you could throw landro in there they don't have great fixtures but I think the defense is going to be okay with defense should be good yeah Anthony Robinson's there you know I mean he's attacks a lot like he's just still good looks good Rico yeah you just start Rico every week yeah lot of lot of picks lot of picks I mean and this is I really like too yeah the fix are just so bad initially but they got better yeah they're been they're a lot better now that man City's passed them yeah it's true they're just like fine now yeah um P said what are your thoughts on matoma for the upcoming run hard to go there yeah it's also hard to evaluate they've had really weird bad pictures I mean they murdered Everton as everyone does you know tough late winner home man united and then the red the red card [ __ ] up everything that that's what I don't like about red cards right is there there's nothing that we learned from that match I don't think like arsenal were beating the absolute [ __ ] out of them for 45 minutes and then a red card happened yeah yeah I mean you're you're really stressing the next two games I think very heavily for matoma that he needs to get points iwi nfo I mean I guess it's the first game he the Everton game he was like coming inside so much he was so influential where I was like is he not just doing Winger stuff and then the next two games happen I was like oh no he's just a Winger again yeah and but that might mean that in the easy games he's not he's cutting inside right and like the hard games he has to keep the width or whatever yeah it just feels like this season especially and looking at a player like this is if I'm not sure that it's going to be a hold for a long time like I don't want to be spending transfers on my mid-price midfielder yeah goes back to the is he one of the best like 8 to 10 best picks attacker picks in the game and it's like absolutely not the world where he is yeah and this is another aspect with him looking at it where it's like he has two incredible fixtures and then he has like a bad run for a month and a half look at his gameweek 12 he has at Bournemouth home Southampton at Fulham at Lester home Palace at West Ham home bref like I would happily wedge him in for like 12 because then you're like okay I could buy at least five or six games and I can deal with him at the end tail end of that run but I have like a bigger Gap just like I can start him happily for at least four five six seven if I need to and I think with these non- premium picks like with the five freeze like that's sort of where we should kind of be looking towards so with just two games I'm just like I like I'd rather get you know someone else either vacate from the premises e bumo where it's like right as Boomer for example even Boomer with his bad fixtures I'd so much rather have him yes like I mean dep team dependent like if you your wild then okay but if I have already wild card and I'm like oh I made a mistake I need to do like I would rather have bumo than Moma right now for game week four and it's not remotely close like it's not even in the same Stratosphere of close yeah yeah and yeah so I mean I think it's it's tough cuz he's competing with them I mean he's competing with that's the hard part that's the hard part about in general right it's like mata's upside is like seven goals and bumo is gonna get four to five free ones yeah his UPS 15 goals he's gonna make that up in P possibly yeah um yeah I'm look at my team a little closer like the odds are very high that I'm wild carding in six yeah it makes sense I mean you have the Newcastle players cast players I have jao Pedro all of them kind of you know switch then my defense is thin because I still have Barco yeah um just makes a lot of sense yeah it does and you can probably start thinking about that and just save until then yeah yeah you can easily save until then yeah yeah okay you just have to hope you don't Hemorrhage price too bad but yeah even it's not that important yeah I have every most expensive player already in my team like yeah and it's still fine um because the Fulham too what's the Fulham switch yeah they're fine for four five I mean even their six is okay but they have two homes that's okay yeah yeah it's okay forr okay uh Ben said any thoughts on welms versus J Pedro and Soo said I second this lader play only played nine more minutes um you know back to Brighton I guess and Pedro is just such a better player and I think he's also just more flexible and on pens and by flexible I mean he could play four positions and WBS can play one yeah and Ferguson's not hurt anymore so I'm I'm with you on ja page right it just feels like he's really good yeah he's just really good I mean WBS is also really good but in a very like specific way ja Pedro just has everything and it seems like he's like herzler like loves him he keeps talking about him in such glowing terms leader yeah all this [ __ ] yeah and he just he pops up everywhere he can play everywhere he's he can make subs and just put him wherever he needs to put him and he's just so clever and the pens are you know we've just said there's two pens in 30 games but they're going to get a few pens this year I mean they'll get some they have [ __ ] and M and like yeah they dribling more dribbling than like most teams in the [ __ ] leag yeah I mean he got how many he got [ __ ] what 10 pens last year all got so something insane so um yeah J Pedro just just seems like a safer better pick pens are just op the flexibility is also not nothing we mention you mentioned Ferguson we mentioned Rutter last pod they have all these Wingers Rutter or Ferguson could start up top in any game and wels we know is injury record whereas like Pedro can just slot over here slot over there do a job here do a job there find his way in the team yeah um last question was Mish this is a fantastic question from Mishka as usually he said now that I've used all my chips and came in as second loser for the mug what advice do you have to reset my dopamine and continue to be plugged into the game holding transfer feels like the hardest thing in the world right now so Misha just needs to feel high from the game and what what can we do for him here I mean I think honestly the answer is triple UPS on defense that is a true high like you need to have du you need to have dueling triple UPS on defense that rotate and and never Captain the chalk never Captain chalk never Captain chalk just like look who's the most voted on who's the most obvious cap don't Captain them don't pick that one y i me yeah triple defense is risky [ __ ] that feels fun yeah risky [ __ ] that's not wck I mean it's borders un Reckless but it's no but there's a difference like you're not tripling up on hip switch defense like find a good run and good players that you like on a team you like right and it's like yeah you're not just capping like you're not just like blind upack cap this guy like you're capping someone you like in a good fixture it's just not he's not as good as Holland in a good fixture also yeah um yeah you're just taking those sort of like me and maybe 45s and you're taking the 45 yeah yeah and I mean maybe not even it depends how high you need to get but you know maybe it's not even rotating triple defense because even just like tripling on you know Arsenal defense like every Arsenal game is still a very like tight rope that you're walking but it does get boring if you do it for a long time so maybe you do need two teams though so you can rotate and feel different I think you should yeah I think you should have two keepers and two Defenders you should rotate between three teams you two two two two or something like that you have three four five between goalkeeper and two def Enders and then you have the fifth Defenders are some Rogue horor or something yeah yeah and you're just going snip snap trip something like that yeah yeah that's cuz then week to week you're rooting for like a different team you have like a different fixture that you care about different players you care about and you're just like trying to hit the jackpot basically you're going for like a stress ball you're just going for a team of the week situation like oh my God this guy had triple you know defense yeah like spur defense he had vandan Romero and poro one week and they lucked into it clean it's like whoa yeah all right that is a good one though good and then I have so many asses to slap unless you want to talk about something else first no I think we're good dude so many signups thank you to everyone you know what we usually do here on International breaks is we pod this pod after the weekend then we don't pod again until Friday life the

the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay welcome toone this walsh youre kid it up today kid it up of the thrashing i picked this up in the uk felt relevant felt like how you doing did you get it at like the nike store or what where do you where do they we were walking around girlfriend doing all the shopping im just tagging along then i was like wait i want to go in this store and it just all kits it was just all like retro kits like this is even from like three seasons ago or whatever gotcha no palace kits sadly but i got my nephew a couple kits i got him a fulham not related to me going to the fulham match at all i was just picking from what they had kid size and then i got him okay this sick ax 1998 kit its so sick he wont appreciate it at all but ill be happy when hes wearing it okay full you what are you doing to him you might be indoctrinating him unknowingly brainwashing him hes just like in the stage of his life where hes just full kit wanker every day of his life like school put on the messy kit with the messy shorts with the messy socks and his boots you got you got to have a word with your brother all i like messi im happy with it no but full kitted with wankers i wouldnt allow d to go full kidding dude i for it at that age goodness okay come on hes six hes just showing his love for the game all right all right so team wsh team walsh is doing good doing whats happening in team walshs part of the world i dont know dg i dont know im just falling into all the things its going wild carded on 96 read the people of your team all right so i finished on my wildar with rya defenses trent robo didnt move from that for one second during tinkering rico who i didnt start with and f fell into after i spent more time thinking about defense like mid midway through the week and look you got you another clean you just got three cleans there right they just he just did it a different way he got a six point way six points clean no matter what and then i have pow and greaves on the bench my plan is just start rico every week and when he gets zero minutes pal will come off and thatll be probably fine and ill deal with it later when it becomes a problem and then my midfield i have palmer rogers mo bumo e and then my forwards i went with kai watkins and joe ladro j pedro who i benched this week i just i had a lot of i spent most of the week on 4 five forward because i just didnt feel like it was i wanted to spend a million there but the more i looked at it with rogers it just felt like when i was going through how is this team going to fail that seemed to be the biggest issue and if i had no money and i was moving somewhere from rogers i felt like i would just be ineffectively using transfers so i just put jao pedro in i dont remember what the sacrifice i made elsewhere was i think maybe it was like the bench or you were toying with saka right you were like maybe out saka set of palmer because youre going to want him and so that was like a i dont i dont remember exactly where the edges were this feels like the team that you initially sent me it was a million so i think what i had was a four five defender instead of greaves and i had 0 five in the bank that was what i thats what i and then i ended up just putting it all in j pedro and putting ges in im so happy with this team so palmer definitely shortterm probably game week six ill get rid of him because i do want to get sck in for those two games i think its worth it and even though palmer has good fixtures his fixtures turn very quickly after that and i just i just feel like saka for the home lester home southampton backto back could be 30 points there and i just probably want that and then my plan is to get holland in for watkins and probably mo probably moow palmer watkins to saka holland and some cheapo is something that im gonna want to do in a couple weeks but i look good to save for the next couple i think im in good shape right now and so how many fre are you on now im like confused okay two free captain bumo so that was genius worked out and aaron said whos walsh selling to get holland back in or is he sticking with his balls like dude are you paying attention while its just flying right now theres no theres no panicking to get holland right now no it doesnt it doesnt matter at all until game week game week seven and you look look im not married to that because while home fulham is good i could be okay not captaining him that week and then the fixtures for him its its the real home bankery banker is game week nine theres no if hes fit theres no universe where im not going to have him for that game more likely than not im going to put him in for seven and cap him for seven and nine and then reassess maybe ill get rid of him again because i like not capping him for a ways and for nonhome bankers so even though he had it this week i didnt feel nearly as good as like the home the previous week he looks great seven goals in three games and brent home brenham home arsenal at newcastle im just going to stick with what i got and hope watkins finds figures out how to get his head out of his and finds the back of the net tbd on that but big tbd big tvd but thats me one more walsh question before my team dr brad said with an extra week of data would walshs wild card be any different which i thought was an interesting question it definitely would be because i think then the palmer saka question it gets closer so i dont know if i would end up going with sock over palmer in that in that position but like we talked about we like the palace fixture for palmer and they ended up matching each others points on six but if youre going to and then i i prefer polymers four and five to sakas but when you get closer to having to use the transfer i dont know im not sure how that trickles down or how many free you have but other than that rogers was worrying i still like having walkins for this run he still is farming chances hes just not finishing them he still returns has home everton home wolves at it switch i know every wild card team ive been seeing in discord has mo and holland and its difficult to imagine not doing that but i just i just dont think its correct because we cant captain both of them ever so you have to i think spend more time looking at the captain there are so many good picks and when you have 28m of your budget in two players if you have rogers and seeno and 5555 p j comes back to the pressure point thing its almost like if you just made like a an excel spreadsheet of your team and were just like who are my greens who are my yellows who are my reds i feel like a lot of the discord teams with even three mum teams im seeing with palmer mo and holland just like theres like six yellows in your team youre looking at like a problem thats a problem these teams im seeing are like trying to go without trent or jamming in like robo with cheap defenders jia pedro starting every week with no cover and look thatll be nice for home it switch home nfo and then youre looking at it and to me id be saying like i dont know if i want to start him for any of the they have home bs like i dont view and that could i could be egg on my face because they might just continue to improve and he is a starter its its its stressful i think and rogers right hes dont know if hes hes good irl i dont know if hes a good fpl pick still we got to figure that out well get there but how about youre also im doing great quite great 87 i got there the more traditional way than you the capping boomo and sh i just have holland cap for a hattrick i have mo i was thinking back of like where we were at pre game week one and i was like huland a mo im just going to get him and when you think about its simplifying the game its like theres i either theyre both going to be doing well therefore im going to be doing well and happy that i have both of them or one or two of them or not going to be doing that well and i can get any player in the game its like the oversimplified version of that and it turns out theyre both the two best picks in the game so im doing well i got another trent clean he his point dodging is on another level this season unprecedented hes dodging them and he also has 20 points which is also a funny thought i had today that we something we never talk about is like clean sheets as an avenue right cuz like i had dku also who also creates chances and everyone hits the bar and y yada y but he has no other avenues either his teammate finishes across or slash cutback or hes getting or hes blanking and hes blanked every game and meanwhile trent just rattling off three cle no problem leaf davis mvp with a seven pointer esa got finally got a goal nine pointer so just fine i already made two moves though because of the j aention jiao pedro price changes so i ripped out doku and mun for jiao pedro and e exact funds feel like im in a pretty good spot with one free with that team moving forward so i feel good m just didnt work out and smith wrote too if he didnt get the goal that goal that 10 point i dont know we could prob were going to have to spend some more time talking about fulham probably i dont know if were it today but thats the thing thats the thing where you have holland and mo and if your five5 is blank its okay if youre your cheapest guy blank its okay when theyre just scoring 15 points both when theyre both scoring like around 15 points every week it covers it papers over the cracks and you dont need much from those picks to still be fine right thats the thing its like dku smith throw and mun smith throw very close to blanking all three and the other two did blank all three but one return in nine games you have to set your priors with these picks anyway right like if i had a crystal ball in front of me that said nothing else other than dku starts all three games 100 for man city i would have been like auto this phenomenal pick and he started all three and created a bunch of chances and i he blanked money is hes going to get however many shots he has in three games i dont know 12 like that and a bunch of them are good chances i would have been like thats good that i want that player what if he was going to get zero shots and 12he headed shots well if the cris ball just showed me a head and said all shots are coming from its like the xg dots on his im not sure im not sure or bicycle kicks thats the mood special three headers and a bic 90 the esa goal was a big pressure rel though that was huge gordon only has one return in three games but it was a 10pointer and i feel good about their fixtures eso got the assist in the red card game and then a huge gold max bones this game so that calmed the nerves a lot with that pick so im like pretty stable im not amazing im not a wild card team no im definitely not especially after these two free but im okay and i i still like most and you have leaf and i have leaf so this start every week easiest game in the world so ni nice that he just came in right away and got you a seven pointer its so huge with a side pass from midfield but he looked he looked good dude he was everything i wanted him to be yep august mug winners first mug of the year and were shipping five mugs out this month because of the triple tie in third place nathaniel brown in first place ak no mystery sathia

like the whole time i was crying all right all right thats that so you have to wait one more rory button aka ding dong diogo good job you good job by you september another three game week month rip for mugs if you have chips because of the international break right now can you imagine a world where theres just no international breaks one season thats just nfl schedule style every week no friday games maybe a couple monday games but i dont even give a about monday games no friday games no international breaks its just every week theres games on saturday games on sunday can you imagine how good that would be wouldnt mind it god were on day two of 14 right now its terrible its unbelievable its so bad day one jesus christ there were games yesterday day one i always feel like the first week of the international break is are like among the worst weeks of the whole year where its like i have to go through all this and then i get to the mon next monday and im like finally okay at least this is like a normal week and i have the same and then i have the same buildup to the weekend and then guess what another international break after game lets you depressing me here with this talk so what do we got going today baby we got games to talk about we got question a lot of happening man a lot of you mentioned villa maybe we go there im curious because you watched this game and i didnt what you saw questions wise wolfie summed it all up he said where do you stand on villa assets ahead of a ridiculous run it feels like the attack is where you want it to be but bailey has potential injury watkins is low on form and a rotation risk is it rogerss team now i that it was a difficult game to watch having rogers and watkins the first it didnt take long before rogers to oly with the oi up was just that was the le like the story of life of the game but i villa just i still theyre just getting away with it almost like newcastle similar to newcastle where for them to be on six points is maybe reasonable because the west west ham were pretty poor gamei one but they were just broadly bad this game and their balance just feels off tian zonana just doesnt seem like that works to me and the fullbacks are problematic the bogard was probably their worst player he was putting up he put up a zero he was so bad and dean on the other side is just limiting in terms of how much he can give you and i just feel like their balance is is just off and rogers didnt play well he wasnt his best game he was getting physical to they were fouling and needling and niggling like they were just all over him and he had a hard he had just had a hard game he had a hard time dealing with it and he it felt like he didnt have confidence in his touch or just i have assurance as he did like the games before where he was just taking everyone on and just in beast mode so the early injury to baile also moved him over to the right which changed things dramatically he hadnt done that and just doing that mid first half i think he was also just a little bit thatll team just not used to it and everyones doing different things when bailey does do so much for them in terms of outlet and creating space and losing him after 15 minutes was a was a was a hammer blow they dont have especially with emmy bndo seemingly i dont know where he is hes fit not hes on the bench i dont he yet hes a like hes just not and then filene hurt right and thats like so all of a sudden they just have no width depth at all they got rid of diabi and they dont have someone to play diabs minutes so like bays out so i dont know if hes going to switch to playing with duran and watkins which he might have to do matson could do a job he im not like calling this my god out of position matson but he could fill in their left wing i just i struggle to see how they score goals like when they have all these players who want to play more centrally and wheres the width what does a goal look like im im not sure they looking at how the personnel is going to be central mids like ramsey was seemed good on highlight but what i was going to say is like the opposite end of this take is like it could have been 2n in 20 minutes easily like alli is getting huge chances one v one that he didnt even get a shot off so it does even like count towards his shots or ex or whatever the one the goalie fouled him or he ran over the goalie as he up his touch that was a oneonone and then he got another oneon one off target and thats like a oly peak olly goal but like what eventually hes going to score and then things will get going but but like yes those were two good chances they didnt continue to create and have more of them though like they didnt have a good chance after the onana go and the onal was one of those but theyre playing theyre playing lester and they rode their luck they could have easily went away with a point and i honestly i feel like a point fit most fair result on balance a score draw but lester gave them some problems and the sub and the its it doesnt smell good from it doesnt smell good but as a nonowner i feel like theres sometimes more clarity as a nonowner than an owner as a nonowner i was like my god i got so lucky cuz that could have been an triple return subs on 65 im like i have to wild card probably because i have to get him for this run and im if i dont have him he subbed on 60 on the nose again so hopefully these two weeks good hopefully these two weeks i dont imagine hes going to be going to england maybe he is i have no idea but hopefully these by the him get him back up and again right this is a thing where im he still got five points so its not a he got something by the way did he touch that ball i think he did they had one replay they showed many replays there was one where you could tell many angles there was one where you could tell that the trajectory of the ball got slightly altered when it pass him but there were plenty of angles where it looked like he was nowhere near the ball is this there was one from there was one from the sideline like the near sideline i remember seeing i was like he did touch but like thats the thing where they he didnt do the things or he kept doing the things hes been doing all year missing his chances so if youre wild carding now youre looking at him like i dont im not doing that they even though they have good fixtures like hes not showing me anything and that could be fortunate or it could be very unfortunate because as we talk about fixtures and form and what breeds which its fixtures breed form so im still going to just give him the next three and you after after the up switch game im just going to reass assin look if he gets me six points in the next three or nine points in the next three then ill just get rid of him im just going to not have him anymore and ill get some good forward and ill be fine ill get eso or whoevers good then and thats fine for me but its its disappointing but i do want to just make another note on rogers like its hes hes hes clearly very skilled and good like at things in real life and he helps the team a lot and he floats and drifts hes good at football good touch like good vision good passing he could have three assists right now and we wouldnt we wouldnt be worried about this but hes the player that for him to be an fpl pick the team has to be playing well because hes not going to just be like e and just be like im just going to blast the world or im going to take six shots in a game hes just he goes with the game he and hes influential and important when the team isnt playing well i think thats with rogers im just like h like i dont know if im gonna even start him over bumo this week i plan to before the week and i think i want to try and stick with that because i dont want to overreact to one fixture but if you have if you have him and hes a start every week with no bench cover i would be looking at a plan for gw seven to figure something out there because we havent even mentioned europe they could look they are struggling to put a good 11 out right now right now theyre injured and they dont have a deep squad and they might just be up in like newcastle war last year where theyre not going to look good all winter all fall and all winter like i can theyre laying the groundwork for that theyre starting slowly and europe starts very imminently so villas concerning to me that stuff is not linear its like em is emry a good coach yes like do they have good players yes but like when is it all going to click no idea it could be in february its like theyre starting to look good and this is good for next season but like we dont we dont know you answered one of these questions but the other one was benji i a lot of people are wild carding because we got a lot of wild card questions theyre fair wild card benji said if youre on wild card over the international break is it even worth the point 6 to bring rogers in your team over winks or insert any4 five if hes just going to rot on your bench and i still think he is i still think getting an eighth attacker at 51 is still worth it so one note on this which im a little bit dis i didnt spend any time thinking about this and i wish i had but i think you just go adama honestly because he doesnt have europe they dont have competition for a spot they did they did bring in one wing they brought in a guy well bring one guy re brought in rees and they signed someone i think i think reese is the main thats forgot he because he can play on the right for sure but its just re its just rees i dont i like i feel like hes adama is going to be playing every game unless he gets hurt right and if youre never starting like thats the thing if youre getting rogers youre never starting him then i would rather have an attacking 5m who i know is going to be starting every game and we have no idea when europe starts over the next 2 3 months if thats going to be the case so i would look at thats fair mil was happy with the dh he got the goal which is a goal i like ive never seen him score that goal before i feel like ive seen him every type of goal because he just like its like random like ive seen him shoot that ive seen him take that chance and put it into the ive seen him do everything thats what like hes the perfect like i show my nephew an adama compilation in 15 years and hes like hes the best player in the world right and im like well what if i told you hes one of the worst danny i said is watkins not a captain pick if he keeps going off at 60 probably not a captain pick and the last villa question was big dunk he said is onana the villa pick and the new doug louise or is it just not sustainable no its ridiculous he doesnt have pens so hes someone very different i think it was liam and discord made a good comp to soup check onana good comp great you could have a charmed eight goal onana season and if he does it in a twomonth span youre flying but his goals are just headers and like lucky late runs into the box its not hes not an fpl pick to me even the late run was a design setpiece like even his ones that seem like open play are still not open play at all do you think that note is overthinking with rogers about not getting him and getting someone like adama because of your potential rotation with him or is that reasonable i think its reasonable i think theres a higher percent chance that roger starts trickling in with some like 27 minute appearances more than adama even though adama also gets subbed every game which is annoying at least hes starting every game with very little competition theres only reese for both wings as far as i can tell harry wison like he but hes the guy who subs on like i dont think i dont think hes about to like i dont think hes knocking the door down for like a start the only thing is if he does want to push hogle up and play burge like theres all of a sudden theres one spot between a wes hogle and that smith row lukic like the other thing is if hes thinks hes going to have an aneurysm because hes watching adama every week and hes like i just need to like never see this guy play again ideally but thats fair lets talk about city okay so this ones targeted a little bit for you callie said walker came on for gardial is rico lewis the best defender pick in the game easy game gets an assist kid is unbelievable i dont know so funny how short our little goldfish memories are like my god what do you whats your rico because you were you were trying to push me off rico for the sake of depth like that my position when you ended up with the jao pedro taking a million from taking five from one of your backup defenders and you had 05 in the bank cuz i had kilman instead i didnt have pow i had kilman and dunk were my two four fs with rico because i like tren robo 3 four5 and one of them being rico and my stance was also i want you to have jao pedro we were both like pretty a line that like you need cover for this team like having just rogers is not good enough and my thinking was in a team with trent robo rico 4540 its a little thin at the back because like villas defense isnt even good and after this run youre never going to want pal to come in you never want greaves to play i have leaf davis but at least he attacks and then like i was just envisioning a world where like rico is no longer starting every week and youre unhappy with your third defender but i was still high on rico just trying to find the balance right it was like i just want there to be cu im worried thats going to be a problem i dont know he looks great hes always looked exactly like this to me like its hard for me to tell like if hes taking a step forward hes doing one specific thing maybe that pep wanted him to do that he wasnt doing before but hes just great hes just like a great talent in a bobbing way of just like hes such a good touch clever such a good dribbler will he keep starting no clue at all especially in the hard games probably not would be my guess aral fulam arsenal those are the ones he misses and doesnt sub on the thing thats fascinating with him a little bit to me is they dont have a fullback like him on the team so when they dont play with him its just gardiol is the most creative one and we remember the end of last season his heroics where he was just coming in and scoring and getting points for fun but he did it in a very different way its like a lot more like root one like or hell go on maybe more d more direct rico is like youre say i imagine hes just another year in the system not positionally getting caught out like he maybe would have done last year but the way that his he he just plays he was playing in midfield hes playing like an eight he inverting stones prime stones rooll exactly and hes 46 now but its pretty good it feels good im glad i have him im happy to keep starting him and like where i came and came out at the end with my specific team with pow is if rico is a problem when pos run ends then like i just am going to need to do something about my defense a transfer a transfer i use a transfer pick your favorite four or five guy for the next 10 weeks and you pick him and i might get rid of rico at that point cuz he missed he didnt play for four games in a row and hes just sitting on the bench like cu pep changed his mind about something because thats how he rolls or i get rid of how and i just get someone else who has a good fixure run and its not him in six game in worst case it seems like its just one free which is not that bad thats where it seemed like but its like red rede jedi had this question he said with pep not playing foden stones or walker yet and europe about to start should we just avoid all city assets other than holland and like i think this sums up like what we all know is that like other than holland probably kev probably also is lumped in with the rest not in the holland category anymore theyre all going to get rotated and we dont know whos going to start and thats a big reason i ripped doku out of my team i feel like i got a little bit lucky to get three starts out of him but like im not banking on that for three more and i think thats like broadly right and thats why like rico is interesting because hes cheap and you can cover easily defensively right we all have a fourth defender that plays and most of us have a fifth defender that plays unless you still have barco like me so its easier and we wont know this until we see him not start some games but we are anticipating that when he doesnt start he doesnt sub on that its going to be a zero minute because pep hates subbing he hates making subs period he likes just giving guys full rest and not putting them in that position for whatever reason so if thats the case it just makes rico when hes rotated unlike with foden or bill like b or doku or whoever all jack kevin they have so much more likelihood to sub on because those are the positions that you typically use your subs more that could make rico just he should be an every team pick and hes getting close to that honestly i dont think hes getting close yet i dont but i do i think we could be about three or four games away from its just like hes should be in he just should be in every team hes going to be 48 by then if hes starting some games they still look good he gets another dude he should have he should have a goal he had he had two he could have two but he should have one like so if you add if you add seven more points onto him hes just sitting there with trent points thing and hes good pick good pick well see when the other guys integrate i dont know but good well the other guys is just one guy its kyle how whats gonna happen stones right sure well stones thats still barely consider him a city employee at this point i dont know what to believe its crazy he just never plays hes never picked never fit never plays and then at some point hell play 20 games in a row be the best player on the team and then ruban just smacks it in his own goal like a piece of that he is genius by him and raul said doku is close to points every week surely a seemingly nailed pep wi who and play both left right is not a transfer out and i just replied to him like too late hes out of my team he i gave him the run that he needed so thats it and the last city question was just mor ari said two hattricks in a row is it even worth it to transfer out holland and have more premiums im guessing walshs wild card performance last week says yes it is different though its different with freeze than with a wild card yes like im not transfering him out dr no its so dramatically different because if you cant if youre doing it with freeze you need to have more freeze than you have right now to do it you need five four could work three is for the holland move because youre distributing so many millions you can make i dont have holland and i just scored 957 whatever the points so there are a ton of good picks in the game and there are a lot of different a lot of different teams you can make that are great without holland as they would be with him or could be with him it depends how quickly you can redistribute and how many picks you have are just not that good right thats it okay what game do you want to go next well i just i just want to talk one thing we talked about southampton a couple games ago as like this is the team to target and then just every game is just more loudly reinforcing and giving us more loud evidence and information that they are the team to target brenham could have scored five in that game i was watching that game it was horrifying as a nonbo owner they are very burnley they are very similar to burnley last year but like first half burnley somehow figured it out in the second half they were shipping as many honestly maybe southampton will too like its possible they still like thats a that was a takeaway of the game was like they dominated for large chunks of that game of course they werent creating good chances because theyre very bad players but like its weird like the zone their defensive third was just a feeding frenzy for brenford they created seven big chances from turnovers there but when it was in southamptons attacking third they were pretty good like suara is good lana came on was good bbd looked pretty good so like thats a burnley esque thing to me is like they would just like surprisingly hold possession and then like mer would like do some dumbass and like whatever it is and they feel very similar to that i hear you no thats a good comp but and that was sids question hes like is bumo a great pick or is southampton just in the business of getting themselves relegated but i think that both things are true exactly like how many games of bumo being god tier without tony do you need before its just like factual we see weve weve seen it with him for enough of a sample size to know that hes electric and has all the avenues and is a phenomenal pick so bumo should be in every team after the next two game weeks just like e and thats other like if you have the holland team and you have like neither bumo nor e and you have like mo and then like youve got trent like you have it in different places and youre in good shape but and i got a this week you have him now those are the picks that you must have in my view to cover over some of the other cheap expensive players that you dont have deal and game week six like im not sure right now that im gonna have enough freeze to have like a team im happy with like i might have to wild card in six but which is fine which is fine newcastle go they have home man city in six and then like a tricky run because i expect everendon to not be the worst team in the league and then brighton chelsea arsenal right so thats a convenient time to like you want bumo and you want three arsenal players like boom thats thats all your moves in gameing six so you need to figure out how to make that happen for sure but southampton bruno plays in this week y early game mean i expect at least three goals for man utd against southampton theyre rashford garnacho bruno should fill their boots i expect i expect every attacker against southampton to filer boots unless they show otherwise so i think im seeing a lot of frustrated people that have bruno that are like just ripping him out at all costs and i shout to sammy i definitely wouldnt ahead of southampton he could come in with a triple return easily in this game so i wouldnt any attacker before southampton bad y yep should we talk about man united game we only got a couple questions benji said is the stench at old trafford enough to make bruno mazero and the other potential picks of voids and then vikings said if youre still not on mo is it rip up your team aka wild card territory if you dont have mo i assume you have holland so youll be okay cuz you can still captain holland this week and homeor is a pretty good fixture for liverpool gek five that is again right that was such an huge factor for me why i wanted to have mo was for captaining him in game week five because five is a little bit tricky of one and city smaller five for those following but as far as man united go theyre just g to finish somewhere around seventh and the players are cheap so im not like seeing a reason toay panic there like theyre not premium assets and the fixtures have been a bit of a mixed bag we know brunos underperformed and the fixtures on the horizon are incredible after the southampton one specifically they have some tricky ways and the homes home spurs home brandham theyre not incredible if you have like maeri its fine just ben this week bench him and spurs whatever its f i assume youre not getting him as a start every week pick and i think you just hold bruno for this week reassess but look lipo almost scored mesi almost scored versus liverpool like that was their best shot of the game so and ugar will come in and a lots going to be made of the midfield as it should because its undermanned and theyre going to struggle with europa league theyre their streets behind liverpool this is any team thats going to finish lower high between seventh and 10th are going to get destroyed by liverpool this year and thats who they are and theyre priced accordingly so if you look at them more in that context and through that lens rather than theyre supposed to be among the best picks in the game and theyre one of the best teams in the league which neither of those things are true nor have neither of those things been for years basic but thats still how we thats still how theyre viewed talked about fpl towers have gotten fans but just just premier cuz were just weve been conditioned to that reality and look their defenders are four five and five theyre theyre price just like aston villa and thats everton or whatever right so thats fine exactly im to im totally with you i dont think theres any more of a stench now than there was game week one its all the same players and the same manager they made good signings its the same team if you think theyre good youre going to get disappointed because they havent been good and theyre not gonna be good but if theyre just not good but if you recognize where they stand in the world and theyre fighting for europa conference league then like theyre theyre off to a fine start they have a win thats pretty good for them lets go on the other side though and talk about your team it was a dismantling performance any change in the i think the liverpool power ranking of the pick its tough where do you see tough between its between mo diaz jot soos behind all of them trent robo kates five vbd 6 mo is still brian had a question about like diaz and jota and then after the match he responded forget my question all good attacks go through mo and its just like like hes still just by far the best he is one of the alltime greats hes just unbelievable looks as fit as ever had the summer off they have seven goals on the season and he six involvements hes three goals three assists insane the hair transplant not having the sicho bob curlys i like a lot but i would have preferred if he did this though and just embrace the me too one of us its okay youre married its fine they just weird theyre weird just are all do you have any athlet well never mind but lets trail that off there i mentioned this i think last pod like theres got to be some out andout liverpool supporting maniac who just went mo diaz jot in their game week one team and they are flying cuz j diaz should not be 75 if theyre starting every week i think like to made them all 75 because they just assume theres just gna be so much rotation everywhere nightmare none of them are going to be picks y and maybe that would have been true under klo maybe that still will be true when europe starts next week but as of now if theyre starting every week theyre completely broken and ridiculous picks so how do you stack up those six trent robo kate mo diaz jot which three i think mo and trent speak for themselves as being well ahead of the pack theyre both nailed and theyre both the best like trents easily the best defender in the game mos easily the best midfielder in the game i dont think anyone would even argue with that and like we said with the trent point dodging he had a he had a goal overruled this week hes created many big chances that none have been scored dont need to go any further into that but then outside of those i still like jota but hes gonna get rotated as soon as were back its like efl cup game and then champions league game and then more games so it might be a world where like i like that you have mo tr robo because robo i think is also safe to start all the games but i dont think its impossible that like the best three are just mo and trent and just get someone else whos amazing as your third pick not a liverpool player so even but what even with diaz and jo youre in youre that worried about rotation that i am you wouldnt have them what i dont have their fixtures i like wanted to look into the champions league fixtures more but i didnt have time but it gets insane immediately its three games its three its a game every 3 days theyre home nfo on saturday the 14th and then theyre away ac milan on tuesday theyre to fly on sunday immediately for a way harder game so like already i dont and darwins not going right like hes banned from international games for like six games for fighting fans and like already its just like well i could see darwi gakpo starting easily at home nfl its just too scary so for me its like i think you got your points and youre happy and i dont think that theyre like you have to hold diaz you have to hold jot at this point im worried about the rotation okay interesting okay and what about kate because hes been a monster since he subbed on and the last two and half games hes just been a beast hes so are you worried about him rotating to because like i he would tempt me over robo on wild card as maybe the third guy because youre youre freeing up a mill like you could show me a team that has if i put that million somewhere else when i if i if you have like trent kate rico 4545 behind them could be an interesting one i think i like that shout especially because we saw robo against man united with garnacho on that side whos just hes just too good to let run free right so all of a sudden the robo that was in the box getting shots taking corners l just did not exist at old trafford at all he was just complet he was left center back they play three he didnt attack at all so like robos trending downwards a little bit because man united is not the only team in the league with good wingers who are fast the only thing we dont know and i think its probably worth a ticket to find out is like is he going to go full klo like kate cant play two gam a week and im never going to let it happen or is he just going to be like hes one of the best center backs in the world play him like you play virgil which is probably the way to go like you talked to neil in preseason right whos just like what are you saving him for and i remember and i so vividly remember us having that conversation like hes fit like this is the bracket of games like hes right its like play your best players when theyre fit because theyre ev yes theyre gonna get tommy john surgery like just pitch so im tempted to take that pun if youre on wild card thats appealing to me maybe kante f5 that like that m the thing with robo is if theyre cleaning at the rate that i believe they will clean at im happy for robo to take the occasional game off attacking when theyre playing a good team right and its the thing with cleans as one of the a yes right and i do believe kate despite his performance in the league so far telling us otherwise to be a donger he could have he could have two dos this year this is the story of his life i dont understand he will score goals event he will he is not they might be in the champions league but they might be hes good at scoring the champions league but theyll happen theyll happen so canate at five cuz we take the piss out of kate for his lack of availability but when he plays hes so generally hes so good and they bought him he was one of the best young center backs in the world and hes just not been able to stay fit for years but he looks right now and weve had weve seen him come back from injury spells previously and just not look that good hes had some 90s where its like god like canate wasnt that good but it look slugish or whatever hes playing this way and i dont know what the subtle demands on the center backs are different but he looks great five millions just liverpool are just like not they conceded some chances after it was already 30 which is concerning for clean sheet but pre that theyre just not conceding chances like header right was like half chances bicycle kicks like a header from a corner whatever but like in all three games its just like the defense just looks good so i like that shot liverpool good what about what about newcastle we got to talk about newcastle josh me and slim asking is gordon to bumo the easiest transfer of your life pyob said is gordon to diaz time or do we keep him for wolves and fulham and ja also just saying how do we feel about esok now and pir do if you have to sell one to afford saka to mo which one goes or both of themselves and im just like so opposite of every single one of the questions i feel fine with newcastle and am i crazy am i am i blinded i think maybe a little bit i think you should be a little bit more concerned than you are currently especially that the next four fixtures or threeways in home man city a lots been made of their home away form splits i think probably more overblown than anything and also they its been talked about because thats true right theyve been pour away for a while for months and months and months and months so while the away fixtures arent that grueling or difficult on paper they seem to make every away fixture difficult they went to bournemouth and got destroyed we talked about the team that they played in that game but look they were playing home spurs and they somehow got the three points but it wasnt like a convincing performance right by any stret but where are you why because you just feel like these two players are such tried and true tested fpl assets and that theyre just going to score a couple goals and theyre going to be involved in these games an interesting it was interesting and wasnt interesting at the same time the spurs game because it was classic and spurs spurs since game of five last year they dominate the ball they get high turnovers they tilt the field and guess what they concede big chances dont create any big chances and they dont create big chances and esa gets a tap in he hits the bar on some freak shot that was strange that was insane i dont even know what the hell that was he got another pretty decent chance gordon took seven corners and indirect freeze and created chance im just like to me i just saw like if these are still the same guys theyre maybe they havent clicked yet to the same level they were clicking at the end of last year thats for sure right fours and fives like every other game week but i didnt see anything that was like very alarming with either of two players and i think its a team thats getting better chars back talis back maybe some guys look at fit barnes starting i think was a huge improvement for the team and the away home away thing i just feel like wolves are a bottom five team fulham are whatever 13 team and like im those are just good enough for me and then im probably g to get rid in six thats just where im at thats reasonable getting hurt again is just comedy im curious about whats going on with trips because i wonder if hes going to saudi or like galas just gonna buy him because like there was a lot of noise about him wanting to leave and he didnt leave but hes there he should be definitely starting over livero definitely like its not even a close call and he played zero minutes so i wonder whats going on with that but because to me like the balance like when they have trips and they have that outlet on the right and they can shift over and like have create this tilted field theyve been doing that for years and theyve never not done that since edwards arrived actual and they might just also be having a hard time coping with that but he was their entire like ball progression their hub for every created chance so and theres a bit of a learning curve there like and someone like sha is hes not trips but hes a good passer and like him coming in will definitely change how they build up and move the ball forward and tanali will too so i dont know what the hells going on there but i still just think its a team on the up whos not playing champions league fixtures soon and these guys are nailed and playing well so their fixtures this season are difficult like they dont have any super awesome prolonged runs like they have all these like difficult fixtures spliced between like a good one with some awkward ones and like youre talking about right they have the these two good games even though theyre away and then think chelsea arsenal back to back and then i dont know theyre theyll be interesting we have to just give them time because the one game a week is going to be such a huge deal this year and there are only about four or five teams in the league that have the one game a week where i think we do need to pay a lot more close attention to see like getting players like bowen aention cant stop shout out to bowen these guys like gordon who just play one game a week if youre what if what youre talking about your fears about the liverpool players borns true like jot darwin gapo k they start rotating and if guess what gordon and esa play 90 every single week like if youre getting 180 in three games from diaz versus 270 from gordon its not close and 180 assumes hes like maybe starting three and getting subbed or starting two like it could be worse than that also three right so its interesting to just monitor it for this at this point thats where im at its like they havent been great theyve been okay and okay with some returns is good of and we forget the red card right the red card is so huge we j cuz they if they scored four in that game were like which they should have every other team does probably would have so that also changes everything and thats also why like es gordon are even in our teams right it like that game was like a big emphasis point so tough one to evaluate thats fair should we jump to some questions maybe lets do some questions lets see what we got here harley boys triple up of mo holland palmer plus a premium defender is perfectly viable with all the cheap options out there is there any reason we shouldnt have all of them and ure we always have one of the best captain options for every week and then jitterbug and brent followed up and said im on wild card is it stupid to not have mo and earling at this point we already touched on that with earling i think the three premium teams ive seen i havent liked any of them youre just going to be giving points back in defense i think and its usually not a thing right isnt like i feel like big at the back is similar to thrum and in that it comes up at some point every single season and usually my thinking is like doesnt that never work usually not especially when one of the thums is 15m and the other ones 12 and a half 10 instead of 10 and 11 and 10 also then its like okay we could maybe like if youre if youre trying to jam in saka palmer and mo its like a no its like you can get there and then your defense is still good your team still looks good its but the other thing too when i was wild card tinkering was like i did feel like the pool is very small of players that i wanted in certain price brackets like other than jao pedro there wasnt a single forward that i felt good about under 75 salanki might fit that mold soon and mata has been a little bit off the boil and weve had some tough games he might if we clicking a gear he might fit not right now oi even he has question marks kai is an incredible pick and then you have eso whos we talk were talking about the fixtures being very diff difficult to interpret you can choose your own narrative there all of a sudden were just theyre not that many forward picks like the midprice midfielders like im not too i dont like love wanting like gordon right now if youre just buying from anyone in the field so its like other than bumo and e im like i dont want anyone there in the cheap mids im like i love seeno love rogers dont love anyone else there so and even them its like even seena like start every week like they have some tough ones i dont know but like being able to sprinkle around the brackets like instead of having to go double or emphasize in anyone like cuz if you have less premiums then youre then youre leaning more on like well you have bumo and e and diaz and jotto you got to think of it like a depth chart what like you got to think of like heres my 75 that i like the most and theres this guy this guy this guy behind him and thats like your guys you can easily get to if this doesnt work out and then as you go down the list you dont want two five fs because theres no one behind them thats good and you dont want any of them and they might both be bad the trickle downs hurt hurts your team and the other aspect is with trent and robo its not having them just feels bad like theyre just so attacking and the defense is going to keep cleans and like i dont i just dont think thats good and its its also right were talking about like palmer mo trent could have 40 points right now and that would be like thats in line with what ive been watching and he has 20 which is still like the most or whatever right so i just feel like trent imbalances it a lot because theres the other world where you just go four fives defense right and you just go put it all in att tag you have three them like whatever you have no keepers arent getting bones them all no rya you just go four five4 a goalkeeper five four fs and youre just rotating whoever and then youre looking at okay well now i can make up the points cuz i have all these premium attackers im not compromising anywhere its just like the defense and i didnt spend time doing that because i just i was just so want i wanted trend robo so much and i like the sevens and i like the way the balance looked but if you are that hellbent on going with mo and holland i would look at that that might beable thats the thats the upside of like a good game with good priced assets is that like i think thats very viable and theres not like theres no four five thats on a top defense right or we all have them well rico r but but theres definitely rotations that exist where youre like only starting them in home teams against the bottom 10 or whatever and like that can make a team good enough to start and maybe those six pointers that trickle in are going to be less than trent 12p pointers but you get exactly like you said youre making it up in other ways so i think its possible i think its possible cie and jam asking about munoz is it worth holding munoz or shifting to someone like rico lewis comes up again should have put r on the thumbnail holy you cant do anything here before lester but its just the right side without alis its not the same hes attacking he is up and down like his fitness and his work rate isnt in question but its ive been thinking about this a lot because its like why does munos look so much worse and the answer i think is simply that ois is so insane that like they had to do so much and double him and worry about him so much that munoz was in space in the final third constantly and hes always available right like whenever m get the ball the game is so easy because there lay it off so easy and this amalgamation of edward kamada had he decent end of the game but he was he had a rough game against chelsea not playing with one of the best wingers in the world surprise like impacting our team worse team and our right side and its concerning so i dont think munoz is that great of a pick i think you definitely just want to play him for last year i wouldnt be doing anything with him this week but unless if sar starts doing bits but even with kamata nether of these players sar might have a bit more pace ob has more pace than kamata for muno what he was we were seeing from him last year with ois he was overlapping underlapping making back post runs when the balls progressing on the left side and breaking out there because we were transitioning faster and now were just like dodgy stagnant slower football with like triangles breaking down and weve had a hard start a lot of our players are getting poached heads returned okay we know whos here now i expect us to improve but that was going to be my like i we bades we have bad pictures so we have united everton liverpool at nfo which isnt an easy one spurs those are not like not great clean she lets just let me just keep running muno out here like hopefully they figured it out we have to be playing well for that to look good like where we could maybe keep a couple cleans and so i think hes a cell its long and short of it i saw i felt like that second half against chelsea i was like yes theyre starting to click like palace has showing me something here but i hear you i a lot depends on like how these new center backs settle like is is chala just going to be great and the defense like is dor coming in for hughes and like they just look great cuz dor is so much better than him in every way well lroy also be good lroy so i dont know but i hear you its probably right kamada is concerning to me hes been its nice that they have lester because you could just wait just wait a week roll a week kams concerning hes just played badly hes just been bad pretty simple as hes just been bad and i dont know if its the physicality cuz it shouldnt be the tactics he knows everything under he play with glasner for months and months and years right but hes just been off it like hes just been so uninfluential and im im also surprised at how slow he has been to give sar minutes like even just subbing him on came on and looked good he looked good but i feel like hes subbing him on like late and you remember for mata which was weird matas i remember when sar was at watford he was having some issues with just like picking up what he was supposed like tactics and stuff like intelligence related st i remember that where it was like he was like doing i think back when they had mil or i dont know who i dont know he had im sure when he was at watford he had 12 managers but i remember like reading some stuff about that where it was like sars like football iq its like what im not sure about that but it just i just kamada on the right and i just want him to play are there like its just kamada coming in and its its so slow and i dont know that treat thats just dudes can just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time which is so true weve been doing that our whole lives its fun to just look at like whos on that like 1920 watford team its just like 1920 well 19 sl20 2019 2020 s wells j pedro deie brito they just have all these weird guys the greek fallback halls jerry d was on that team god dude like they dor is on that team some lads so many guys holes my god had so many h bosses all right so were were a bit of a mess still but we did play a little bit better second half i think you guys will get better i believe still so do i get better figure no problem with him do you okay think hes good im glad we got him because we needed some competent player whos not klein who can play center back so im very happy to well i think lets squeeze in a lifestyle question here before we go back to fpl arnest lot said for walsh if you were the sorting hat what hogwarts house did you put aan in i think i think als a gryffindor honestly wow is that good what does it mean i dont even know harry potters clan harry potter well all of them are in gryffindor the main character vibes thank you its its just cuz i you i think that the to me the biggest thing with griffindor are just like leaders and i think thats what youre like so thank you d thats it i appreciate it when are we going to do the second whens the second well it is international break so its a good time to watch a movie maybe ill watch it this weekend okay can you tell me if you do can you tell me because then i will rewatch it yes ill definitely alert you dont surprise me on this one okay i wont okay get you ready with questions and what not whis and did we got a i forgot to tell you we got like the we had the mets had a remember i told you i got all that mets gear from the guy who works with the team one of them was like a harry potter mets crossover where you got a scarf and it was one of the houses and like you didnt know what it was until you opened it so its like one so the colors were different based on the house colors for the harry potter but like mets insia no so like it had the mets insignia on all of them on one half and then the backside had the harry potter house and we got ravenclaw house did you get ravenclaw theyre like the smart party pants house nice i could see that what which characters in ravenclaw which that i know chang no i dont think any of them they dont theres no ravenclaws in it there there have to be but they dont like open up the other houses to the characters okay mainly just slyther the heel and the whats the non heal what do you call it i forgot okay heel and the what is it gast where are you we g hes screaming right now its a whisker said is kai good enough to cover for saka kais good hes good but i me what is the question i dont understand this question what does coverage mean what does that what does it mean does coverage mean if i have get the same and i dont have his teammate whos a better pick and thats why hes more expensive then im fine because thats not fine but i just dont know what it means i dont know what it means hes not cover because they both are g to score a lot of points in hom lesser home southampton in gaming six and seven so no thats my answer no i to me its like the coverage ideas know im not going to captain them are they going to get roughly the same points so i can get a cheaper lesser owned player to be equivalent to the other guy and i dont know theyre just both great but kais kais so good dude kai because of his price and mainly because of his position better i would prefer if i could only have one and then build the rest of my team i 100 its kai because mo exists and palmer exists and theres other good mids but theres very few good forwards and kais underpriced and saka is just appropriately priced matters thats fair thats there also i wanted to mention this no pensas here theres like theres no pens i think its probably one of those things where theyre like were gonna make a stand cuz were a referee union or whatever and then three months from now its like a pen every week cuz theyre just like correcting their dumb theres been two pens far two pens in three g so theres 30 games and there have been two pens thats up thats insane thats absolutely one was holland and the other was who was the other one hack yep y yep its thats crazy especially early in the season you expect i always expect more pens in the beginning of the season cuz random call whatever like sam sammy stack said because of the five transfer rule theres less reason to make moves every week as rolling is always an option im curious to hear your thoughts on moving aggressively and using transfers when we dont necessarily need to versus being patient and waiting for certain assets to pick it up thats a good question ive been thinking about this too like well not wild card but just looking at people like i have to get three i have to get four to get like i just cant do anything till i get five its like i think we might be a little bit over correcting on that front right how many points do you get when you reach five transfers is it 100 mystery chip if you got five transfers you get 100 extra points like i think thats going to happ you get like a xbox live reward you get a stress ball for it because then maybe priorities would change but its like balancing this notion of having four transfers or using two to dramatically improve your team if you can dramatically impr dramatically improve my team for 500 bob like i think you need to scrutinize a little bit more because like youre its like what were talking about kate like youre saving them for what like to still use them on these same players or is it like i want to buide my time because theres one or two bad fixtures and then its a sea of green and i want to use these transfers on these three players but like are you thinking about saving five transfers to just be okay im making five moves now or are you doing it to like whats the point i think we like i get another wild card if i get to five because i get to wild card actual wild card and then still have five but its like but if you wild card i assume your team is a disaster you just you just need three exactly like i think even wild carding like you coming out with two frees after wild card in because you almost always i dont think either of us have ever made a move straight the week after wild carding something very insane would even wild card you have two free you save you have three free like that youre in a great position youre in incredible position right there because i dont think the goal is get five and then start making a single transfer and float like youre not improving your team if youre doing that so like it does come i think the planning matters a bit more this year where you need to look at these are the these are the three or four players that i want to move and i want to do it this way and like thats where the depth matters a lot because you dont want to have to like for my team right like if as a picked up a knock i would just hold him and i have rogers and ja pedro but if youre if youre looking at your team and you have po po is a bank youre like ill just whatever but like thats where i feel like you want especially with europe starting off like you want to still be in position to save but if you have someone like you you have gordon right and youre happy with him right plenty of people have gordon not happy with him its like well if youre going to hold him for two away fixtures that youre not sure about how hes going to perform ahead of man city and then a bad run versus like dont get four free and just get bumo or bums bad he has two get just get like es strictly better for the next two and then hes a better asset long term as well so and like its like youre going to then wild card in six or seven and as is going to be in your team and gordons not so like you just make it sooner than later i agree with that ive just ripped mooney and doku out of my team on a sunday for that exact reason im like i dont want them longterm i dont trust them shortterm i think the guys im getting in are better shortterm right j pedros home if switch home nfo as is home lester home man united at everton like id rather have them than just save and squint and be like but mun is home west ham its like just make your team better get more points its interesting because it is very like the saving situation and taking hit no ones taking hits like very rare you probably should not be ever and i think that it makes sense because say having all these bank transfers like if youre just planning and getting safer guys then you can do it without but theres going to be some type of like the games going to going to correct itself and this new rules introduced and i think as a community or like us in serious fp air quot serious bro i think over in to one side where its like you should be saving under mostly all circumstances where it should probably instead of be that like thats like at a nine it should probably be more like out a six where its like you should save but no different than last year like when you could get two like its like every year weve ever played flpl saving is great if you can afford to save but we set our teams up differently because we couldnt get five frees so we didnt have depth didnt have we had fires all over the place because were trying to h roll right so its different interesting game the interesting stand it was cool to see three free transfers on my team before i used two of them and im back to normal one free but it was you had your fleeting you had your fleeting moment that was cool lets see not that many more questions as sheer said out of kai and esak which one should make way for jao pedro so funds can be released for salah and midfield i just trust kai so much more trust the te and also like im assuming if im wild carding in six then im keeping isach over kai but you have other scenario any other scenario im keeping kai because i know hes great i know the team he plays for is great and i know i want him in six i think thats just it oy said im asked us cuz we didnt talk about him is porro startable versus arsenal or a transfer out if we dont have another good defender to start do we bench porro i think he gave you a good idea against newcastle hes just gna farm shots that are low xg and he could bang any one of them but yes theyre not going to clean and right exactly what he showed me in his one pointer against newcastle is that like i can start this guy any week dont care creates chance takes set pieces and takes six shots like get in my team absolutely and you you were lucky enough or not lucky you were fortunate enough to be able to have your team set up so you could bench him in newcastle bench and youre going to start him in arsenal right youre not going to play nfl against liverpool so but then youre looking at a wide birth where you dont have any home bankers for a while i dont think home brand as a home banker honestly this year but no theyre theyre good but they could clean two of the next five you dont know which two of like home brenham at united at bren at brighton home western at palace like you could tell me theres two clean sheets there and be like which two 20 rolled any of those i have no idea no clue and he start you just start him all those games and youre midt defense just like billa playing midtable teams playing midtable teams and he takes a million shots pieces hes like a five5 leaf davis yes but his teams a little better well probably more than a little better theyre better theyre better but hes still great pick absolutely i am i dont like not having him after watching that game im just like i want i had teams where i kept him but rico just turned my head a little bit too much but it was sc watching him even with him first on my bench like i was just like god is he about to brace like am i flo said what four or five defense can you have in your team without a transfer for the next eight game weeks very specific but lets just call it longterm villa was one shed i but i wish i had leaf davis not just because this happened just recently but i just still feel like villa like i dont three like i have three villa players like how did i get here like i dont know what happened bright you were very close to dunk i think brightons but they dont have good pictures well they have home tr nfo before a bad run that also includes home talking about eight right start every week its definitely not a start every week its fair chelsea they have some good ones a few they have good for the next four they only have like one bad one even like brenham they have these two bad ones but then they have six good ones so the question is tough cu eight start every week for eight is hard for long time and thats why i go back to villa rate them or dont rate them its just the picture are just absurd and theyre just like that this most teams wont have a run this long and good all season right home everton home wolves at ep switch home man united at fham home bournemouth thats not eight but its pretty close its good i think you could throw landro in there they dont have great fixtures but i think the defense is going to be okay with defense should be good anthony robinsons there hes attacks a lot like hes just still good looks good rico you just start rico every week lot of lot of picks lot of picks and this is i like too the fix are just so bad initially but they got better theyre been theyre a lot better now that man citys passed them its true theyre just like fine now p said what are your thoughts on matoma for the upcoming run hard to go there its also hard to evaluate theyve had weird bad pictures they murdered everton as everyone does tough late winner home man united and then the red the red card up everything thats what i dont like about red cards right is theres nothing that we learned from that match i dont think like arsenal were beating the absolute out of them for 45 minutes and then a red card happened youre youre stressing the next two games i think very heavily for matoma that he needs to get points iwi nfo its the first game he the everton game he was like coming inside so much he was so influential where i was like is he not just doing winger stuff and then the next two games happen i was like no hes just a winger again and but that might mean that in the easy games hes not hes cutting inside right and like the hard games he has to keep the width or whatever it just feels like this season especially and looking at a player like this is if im not sure that its going to be a hold for a long time like i dont want to be spending transfers on my midprice midfielder goes back to the is he one of the best like 8 to 10 best picks attacker picks in the game and its like absolutely not the world where he is and this is another aspect with him looking at it where its like he has two incredible fixtures and then he has like a bad run for a month and a half look at his gw 12 he has at bournemouth home southampton at fulham at lester home palace at west ham home bref like i would happily wedge him in for like 12 because then youre like okay i could buy at least five or six games and i can deal with him at the end tail end of that run but i have like a bigger gap just like i can start him happily for at least four five six seven if i need to and i think with these non premium picks like with the five freeze like thats where we should be looking towards so with just two games im just like i like id rather get someone else either vacate from the premises e bumo where its like right as boomer for example even boomer with his bad fixtures id so much rather have him yes like dep team dependent like if you your wild then okay but if i have already wild card and im like i made a mistake i need to do like i would rather have bumo than moma right now for game week four and its not remotely close like its not even in the same stratosphere of close and so i think its its tough cuz hes competing with them hes competing with thats the hard part thats the hard part about in general right its like matas upside is like seven goals and bumo is gonna get four to five free ones his ups 15 goals hes gonna make that up in p possibly im look at my team a little closer like the odds are very high that im wild carding in six it makes sense you have the newcastle players cast players i have jao pedro all of them switch then my defense is thin because i still have barco just makes a lot of sense it does and you can probably start thinking about that and just save until then you can easily save until then okay you just have to hope you dont hemorrhage price too bad but even its not that important i have every most expensive player already in my team like and its still fine because the fulham too whats the fulham switch theyre fine for four five even their six is okay but they have two homes thats okay its okay forr okay ben said any thoughts on welms versus j pedro and soo said i second this lader play only played nine more minutes back to brighton and pedro is just such a better player and i think hes also just more flexible and on pens and by flexible he could play four positions and wbs can play one and fergusons not hurt anymore so im im with you on ja page right it just feels like hes good hes just good wbs is also good but in a very like specific way ja pedro just has everything and it seems like hes like herzler like loves him he keeps talking about him in such glowing terms leader all this and he just he pops up everywhere he can play everywhere hes he can make subs and just put him wherever he needs to put him and hes just so clever and the pens are weve just said theres two pens in 30 games but theyre going to get a few pens this year theyll get some they have and m and like they dribling more dribbling than like most teams in the leag he got how many he got what 10 pens last year all got so something insane so j pedro just seems like a safer better pick pens are just op the flexibility is also not nothing we mention you mentioned ferguson we mentioned rutter last pod they have all these wingers rutter or ferguson could start up top in any game and wels we know is injury record whereas like pedro can just slot over here slot over there do a job here do a job there find his way in the team last question was mish this is a fantastic question from mishka as usually he said now that ive used all my chips and came in as second loser for the mug what advice do you have to reset my dopamine and continue to be plugged into the game holding transfer feels like the hardest thing in the world right now so misha just needs to feel high from the game and what can we do for him here i think honestly the answer is triple ups on defense that is a true high like you need to have du you need to have dueling triple ups on defense that rotate and never captain the chalk never captain chalk never captain chalk just like look whos the most voted on whos the most obvious cap dont captain them dont pick that one y i me triple defense is risky that feels fun risky thats not wck its borders un reckless but its no but theres a difference like youre not tripling up on hip switch defense like find a good run and good players that you like on a team you like right and its like youre not just capping like youre not just like blind upack cap this guy like youre capping someone you like in a good fixture its just not hes not as good as holland in a good fixture also youre just taking those like me and maybe 45s and youre taking the 45 and maybe not even it depends how high you need to get maybe its not even rotating triple defense because even just like tripling on arsenal defense like every arsenal game is still a very like tight rope that youre walking but it does get boring if you do it for a long time so maybe you do need two teams though so you can rotate and feel different i think you should i think you should have two keepers and two defenders you should rotate between three teams you two like that you have three four five between goalkeeper and two def enders and then you have the fifth defenders are some rogue horor and youre just going snip snap trip something like that thats cuz then week to week youre rooting for like a different team you have like a different fixture that you care about different players you care about and youre just like trying to hit the jackpot youre going for like a stress ball youre just going for a team of the week situation like my god this guy had triple defense like spur defense he had vandan romero and poro one week and they lucked into it clean its like whoa all right that is a good one though good and then i have so many asses to slap

[Music] good evening everyone for anyone saying the sponsors of blackbox pay us too much money have never had to sit with Mark s for 35 minutes while he sorts his camera out that's all I'm saying oh my God you know like people say what's your superpower I think my superpower is I can take any trivial thing and make it really stressful four years you've been doing this every week honestly oh my word right yeah I'm okay I had to go and have a Wii sorry as well right at the end just as we were going to go live on night I'm gonna have to go now oh was I was just are you joking but the good thing is a six minute credits mean everyone got to see like the full you know intro you know words on the screen there you know some people won have seen them all so amazing I hope our sound is okay because we haven't had time to sound check but I think it's all good um that we sound good loud and clear says Derek NOS hello Derek thank you for joining us n the karbers Sals is camera out is quite the you no honestly it was Nigel um did you win B mark on the toilet this time yeah I no I went in yeah I I used porcelain for sure no one will know what you're talking about there is definitely context needed but I'm not even gonna say it so no you know there's 783 watching I think the the more technical issues we have the greater the audience way yeah yeah it's always been way yeah sorry we're um 35 minutes late and two hours later than the normal time of 7 but you know we're here it's fun you got beer as well we are I've got a beer we've got lots to talk about guns out is the title of the show uh because obviously everyone selling sacker odard injury Dean rice is out um there's definitely a tide a tial wave of people moving off their Arsenal assets and I think I'm sharing the Airways with one here aren't I as you doing you are indeed and I'm I'm seeing the moves I'm planning loads of people are making making those moves now some people making them for for hits I don't feel good about them at all so I'm surprised so many people are are thinking about um sacker and isach out I'm I'm really nervous nervous about it I've already made one of the two moves so no going back now you know how it goes right you know you know in fbl one of the unwritten rules is when when a large section of of the community go with a particular opinion yeah and that opinion could be a slid IND doors crosss whatever it is you know what happens next right normally it normally blows up in our face doesn't it any any Mass decision like this that's gone well I no exactly exactly very rarely does it go called into plan um which um you know it's disconcerting for me because I'm going to end up cing sellah so if people who are selling sacka getting sah and that doesn't work out then it's still gonna hurt me because I'm probably end up Captain so there'll be some pain this side as if it does go wrong um flanny boy 1888 thank you so much for the uh Super Chat already we will get to Super chats at the end we'll probably be here till 10 to midnight or even later than that but um that's all good you know we do it that's the kind of thing we do um right let's let's get on with some stuff shall we uh but before we do we better have a word from our sponsors and my word we earn those sponsors yes oh yes well everyone by now will be familiar with with sleeper I think you know obviously a lot of content creators talking about it um a lot of people getting involved in the in the pickham league and we had our first winner um from that and a PlayStation 5 we'll be going to our monthly winner of the of the pickham uh League me and you Mark or you and I I should say took part in our first ever blackbox draft it was fun it really good yeah I loved it um it was like uh yeah it kind of revived memories of the old days um I obviously we were running the team together there was a little bit of two and thr between us you you were nay saying my picks but I think in the end we we basically got a team of 15 seven of which are all injured or suspended but you know yeah I mean our team is Palmer salanki Diaz kuna Rea Romero aangi and Bailey then it starts getting a little bit Suspect with rice caori such Anderson kadogo cliver honana and Alex Moreno but everyone's in the same boat the first sort of eight or nine picks were fine and then it was a bit um yeah it got a bit ropey after that I think we're in a pretty good pretty good position against the others I I think so once we get K Galo play in and califur I can't why have we got why have we got these players I can't pronounce you idiot um once we get them back from injury any players it would have really limited us we were that was our policy yeah that's absolutely true um yeah so yeah I'm gonna love doing that and um I'm looking forward to it really looking forward and the sleeper app was good the interface was good it didn't crash no issues very smooth experience so get involved get involved if you fancy having a that is the message yeah get involved uh try out the draft use the um QR code on the screen give that a scan uh you know just just give it go let us know what you think think of it I thought it was a great um I thought it was a great great interface and and the draft was fun and yeah anyone asking where they can watch it there are I'm hoping there's going to be more Clips like the ones they posted um coming soon so yeah if not we'll publish the whole thing arguments and the bit the bit when GI kept signing injured players and we were like it would you say he's gonna need a good physio or something like that yeah no I said he's goingon to need Jesus Christ as a physio to revive them from the dead Bailey is injured I know David yes Bailey is injured we we have picked some injured players as well but we haven't got Reese James how have we got on and Alex Moreno all right that be fine right fbl let's get on to that sh we uh let's look at our game weeks first of all shall we uh you did all right you know yeah 73 got some points from Henderson finally four points for him Trent porro and Robinson another assist from Robinson he's he's done right in the first in the first few weeks pretty happy that for four five uh jotter Gordon and Rogers that was all a bit of a disaster one assist from sacka nothing from the other three uh attackers despite all you know all scoring goals nothing from jot is really disappointing when de's got the brace and Salah got what 17p pointer um so yeah that was that was annoying uh harand and isach harand with a hattick captain basically carrying the team as usual isach with the goal he's been unceremoniously shipped out after his uh after his first goal of the season and beta who's blanked twice since I bought him in um now has massive threat um you know from from other signings they've made and I'm a bit worried about him and nothing much on the bench it was an okay week but yeah like one one player scoring over 10 and that was harland's Captain the rest is pretty average what you make it J because obviously um we had high expectations when we learn he'd start the season down the middle um but Diaz has been the one of the of the two S5s to come out and and and hit with big points so far J the right week one but I don't know he he does seem to be dropping deeper and letting Salah and Diaz be the ones that tuck in is that your impression yeah I mean next year I have .08 in that Manchester United game which obviously isn't ideal but 0.99 and 0.65 in the games before um and you know had had a goal and assist in though so going into the the game against manchest United I was pretty pretty conf he was going to get something and you know when the score goes to 3-0 you think he's going to be involved in some capacity but I think it's just going to be one of those is I think salah's just obviously going to consistently score points and then the other you know i' put sabosa into that bracket as well probably not as high as Diaz and J but I think they're all just going to have weeks where they score well score weeks where they don't and you can keep trying to chase it and getting Diaz but I think you just pick one and kind of stick with them and until jot loses his places I'll be I'll be sticking with him um people requesting to see how ranks I'll get I there we go they're under our names there and while they're fairly decent we'll keep them head with Noland yeah well more than that in a minute let's get to my team and go through that no Harland of course uh it was ryer two points Lewis six Trent six coner two Smith ow2 son just the three sacka Captain which was a big disappoint that in a minute Salah 17 Rogers two isach nine and wiissa who was my transfer coming in with goal and bonus um yeah 69 not great obviously didn't have Harland Captain the wrong player um and I will point out the fact that I've captain in Salah only once and got a double figure return in match of the Day game week two of Captain e gameweek one and sacka game week three what have they got in common they're both playing teams at a man sent off so on both occasions when I picked the captain other than Salah the teams I've captained a player in have been reduced to 10 men with rightfully 45 minutes to go rightfully sent off come on dear me yeah it was um it's frustrating because I think I mean saaka sh still should have got more points because he had a chance right at the end and he was oh heavily involved was I mean he had had hint you on toes didn't he in the first sort of 15 20 minutes it was very concerning um and then we started to play a bit better for I don't know it was a it was a evish game but Arsenal will feel like they should have won that especially towards the end like you say I thought I thought that was in I thought Saka was just going to bury that and it was gonna break some hearts great result for Brighton Arsenal should have won it but Brighton good account of themselves again yeah and I was disappointed with son because I really did think Spurs would get something at Newcastle um and they played well did okay uh but Newcastle kind of grounded out the result didn't they and Spurs again um liking game week one at Leicester away from home just couldn't convert their play into chances and goals and yeah some hanging on this week I don't know whether he'll go it doesn't look like it looks like I'm going to make another change but more on that at the end but wha was great I mean hoped for turn got one now he's going to be on my bench for a few game weeks until brenford run starts in game week six onwards and that's where hopefully he'll come into his own but I've noticed a lot of content creators talking about him now so good to get to him early the original the original and of course we know how it works because I got him first no one else is allowed to have him that's that's exactly the way it works right should want him it's like last season so once you get some points from him he's dead to me I'm never I'm never getting this now ever good brilliant that's that's that's fine uh let's look at Great and the good and see where we stand in that let's go this is why we have to drink the cams Harry's gone top of that Harry how does he doing yeah it's crazy isn't it because um I think he's got Salah and harand right like prazz so obviously Salah and harand teams have done very well at the start of the season and perhaps the shortcomings of going Salah and Harland don't reveal themselves over a short spell it's going to take longer so that's that's my reasoning as to why I haven't got Sal yeah but obviously you know Salah pra and and Harry have done started the season really well n 1,996 or 196,000 for Harry PR 2016 216,000 rather general just behind them and then Fran uh 584 just above me Luke's in between we've got a we got a disabled sandwich between uh between us as Luke is between us disabled just to make that clear he his he his online name good clarification yes and then Andy coming up behind you so to speak um it's all very close all very close I would just say Harry hasn't got Salah he's he's Harland was he not no he is he is Harland only um he has got the mighty chriswood though which explain will be will be happy with his nine points and E kept to favor of e as well which again just shows patience with players good good line numbers eventually they'll they'll come good so yeah um yeah it's nice we're we're we're not in the bottom the you know we're not in the trenches at the moment both in the top million I'll take that yeah yeah qualifying for Europe at the moment in the great the good which is fine we'll keep going on that um let's look at uh start looking at some data then team defense um so this is obviously caveat fre fre game weeks small sample etc etc um but you know we're looking for Trends we're looking for trends that could continue uh one thing that's unlikely to continue I'd imagine is noton Forest being the second best defense in the Premier League but um there they are at the top but of course as you see fixture difficulties yeah they had they've had the best start to the season with their first three fixtures City at the top low and um seven chances per 90 conceded the best of any team here um and what's interesting is you know one we expect City to stay in the top two uh the second Point that's interesting is Arsenal who have kept three clean sheets and well two clean sheets and were keeping one until Brighton scored and they reduced to 10 men down in seventh you know we' have thought Arsenal would be in the top two or three defenses but they're not and they're actually conceded in 14 chances per 90 which is quite a lot considering their reputation going into the season as the strongest defense well it's not a broken record but they were lucky to not concede to cabia in gameweek one and they were I don't even what you'd call it how they didn't concede toy Watkins in in game week two um and yeah like I said they they were in they were in good control of of that game um limiting Brighton to to a few chances the red card kind of changed things we had a really really good spell um when just after that red card which it's quite natural and then they started coming towards the end but luckily we managed to actually score in that in that spell where we were dominating um a bit more but yeah I mean it's it's obviously we're going to be talking about the ramifications of of odard being out havs having to drop back into into Midfield um obviously they've got lots of defensive options Timber came in um but califur is he got a knock or is he pushing he got knock an international break yeah yeah I thought so um but I mean that doesn't really change the makeup of it I mean are they going to adopt a more defensive approach now they've lost because they've lost odard and they've lost their kind of main Striker because hav is gonna have to drop back to Midfield you see hav dropping back and well no jeesus um could return um so we we'll need to get our Teta team news but the last we heard about jezus is following the international break he might have a chance so he could be back in the frame you see it then as tral out front hav dropping back do you to take OD guard's plays in Midfield probably probably because I mean who do they bring into midfield if if they keep habits up top do they bring yeah two Stoppers wouldn't they it's part still there yeah yeah he started the season yeah so if they bring him in then that's good news for the defensive but not so good news for zaka presumably um mourinho's still out isn't he so they can't they can't bring him in um yeah I don't know I think it's it's one of the reasons I mean it's been an up and down International game with with the transfers I've been looking to make you know debating whether to take sacker out or not now I've landed on sacker out and I think this news pushes me into that because I don't think it's going to affect their defense very much but really if you've got reyya CA Gabrielle you're probably not expecting a clean sheet in the next two games against Spurs and City anyway oh yeah but it has to yeah I mean I've in my predictions I've said that Spurs will score um I agree with you I think that I don't I don't think in O odard I mean we're going to look up I've got some charts and tables on odard later on in the show that we'll get to I me look at midfielders but I don't think it changes Arsenal's approach to the game um in that they are I think by their very nature defensively sound in every game they go into I don't think they go into any game um you know going all out attack they are first and foremost Resolute and then they've got quality up top to to score goals but they're not going to win games 5 six nil they they've become almost what city have become which is a side that can get results but never really takes the handbreak off and manages games out that's what they've become it's a results machine and it's no surprise that artet has followed the same path that Pep's done with with City in that respect you know of the teams at the top that are full on attack you'd have to say it was Liverpool under clop whether it is Liverpool under slot so far you'd say yes they they're the team who will go full thr and score goals but that could be changing as well Liverpool are third in this table defensively and I don't think it's a long stretch even after three games to say that we're seeing Liverpool change and they're actually now a team that are more pragmatic and defensive do you do you feel that yeah I mean there's not many managers is there that have come in and and and kept free clean sheets in the first in the first three games um I'm yeah I've been really impressive I've rewatched the the highlights of the the Liverpool Manchester United game and you know they're just leagues apart in terms of organization everything I mean it's going to be really yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really interesting know what what slot does with Trent um because there are some rumors going around aren't there that he's not totally happy with him there's always been question marks around his defensive ability well if slot wants to turn Liverpool into a more pragmatic and defensive unit what does that mean for for Trent because you could argue that he's a bit of a liability defensively but obviously makes up for it with attacking play but yeah I I don't think I don't think Liverpool are getting turned into a defensive side I'll take that back but it's more about control it's and which is what city and Arsenal are about it's about controlling the game managing the game and the result being primarily the goal rather than we're going to go all out and play like the heavy metal football that klopp used to play I think we're seeing the dial move back some notches from that they're still scoring goals but what we are seeing is suddenly rather than just being arsenal were the only team we can invest in defense for defense suddenly City are Reviving it seems maybe maybe it's too early to say but maybe City are going to be that strong defensive unit again that we can go to you know who knows who we end up picking viio or Lewis probably but Liverpool are now in that bracket as well so far it would say yeah and there are ways that we can tap into it with potentially Allison Robertson's really popular over over the break as well I've noticed there's a lot of AI recommendations for for Robertson uh going in I mean the the difficulty with that is obviously you have to then sacrifice potentially going for I mean assuming Trent and Salah are in your side you're basically having to choose between a Diaz jota or a or a Robertson and I still favor the the attack I think with the fixures the way they are but Robertson has presented himself as a as an interesting option going going forward um but yeah it's and the other and obviously the other really interesting thing is what's going with coner and canate like is canate just starting every week now because then he's an option as well I don't want to get into that because people are buy C conon their drugs and blame me for that but yeah I I I think when Europe starts we know game week four onwards that's going to answer some questions isn't it on that front um just wanted to mention and Villa defenses here they are fourth and fifth in the table the table obviously is sorted by XG conceded non penalty per 90 and we've got City top 0.68 forest second 0.70 then Liverpool 0.79 bit of a gap to Villa on 1.0 and then Chelsea 1.09 I I mentioned Villa and Chelsea because in terms of fixture difficulty they've had a a tougher start in the top three so therefore perhaps and again early days perhaps Villa and Chelsea could turn into sides that we can look at I think probably in that second tier below City Liverpool and Arsenal but perhaps Villa and Chelsea could be the teams we go to for some value in defense yeah the difficulty with vill obviously the champions league is going to start and how they're going to deal with with that with all the games that they've got to to play I mean coner is obviously really popular you've got him not K quansa the other one the K coner uh but people saw the kind of hard part of that and the reason why he got less than 100 points last season despite playing most of the game is just Villa concede stupid goals and concede goals you know and even though the stats are the underlying stats are good I still don't really trust them um in that area you lose that attacking threat that you get with with someone like Robinson for example at four five but the fixtures are nice so you are going to want to play him I just yeah I mean I'd still favor coner to like Co will though at four or five I I trust Chelsea even even less the teams just seem to be able to get at them and I'm really surprised to see them at fifth on list they seem to get carved open quite quite easily but the underlying stats aren't really supporting that no I mean 10.67 chance he's considered P90 the same as Villa um so so far we haven't seen that middle in defense emerge we're still waiting to see who it is and when we're going to get to Defenders we can see we know there's value with Robinson at Fulham and porro at Spurs or maybe Romero at Spurs what's interesting here wolves are 1.32 with some really tough fixtures they might be worth look and there's a name I want to pick out when we get to Defenders who could be a Target when the fixtures improve Brighton Middle in defense at the moment in 10th do you expect them to climb that table because I I see you as a more defensive side you know since the Zerby left right yeah there's there's more of a plan I think to deal with there's a plan B when things aren't going well to to drop back and again I think we've got players who have already bought into the system and and there seems to be like quite a lot of cohesion in the way we attack and and the way we defend the issue is a little bit that Dunc is getting on a bit kadogo is going to come in um untested in the in the Premier League I mean he's got a great reputation people seem to absolutely love him but hasn't played in the Premier League yet we've got hinwood playing a a left back his Stan should come back but he's been a bit suspect you know defensively I don't know there's there's a bit of like change and a bit of you know amendments coming to to to the Brighton backline so would I expect immediate improvements on this probably not but I think it will settle down and we will become good good value I think the ver Bren and like fleen rotation if you're on a wild card just looks so good I was gonna the end of the season let's get to Keepers save that chat till Keepers um es ban mentioning con got not playing fing he did indeed and he went off I think on about 70 minutes didn't look too serious um he wasn't going off shaking his head or head in his hands or anything like that so we we do have to wait for the presser for memory um so we have to see we have to see whether coner is going to be ready for the weekend but yeah you mentioned the fixtures let's just bring up the the the fixtures for Villa this is the long ticker showing game weeks 4 to 12 and Villa are four in that um but if we look at the shortterm pictures Everton at home Wolves at home it's Swit away doesn't really get much better than that does it it doesn't but at the same time Everton were really really impressive against Bournemouth for literally 88 minutes you know Jack Harrison was looking good Cal L had a bit about him they were attacking really well um and to lose that game is is one of the biggest like throwaways I can I can remember because I was watching it a match of today and honestly Bournemouth didn't have a highlight until 88th minute there wasn't a single attack of not for Bournemouth and then there was like six highlights in a row all Bournemouth attacks every cross seemed to cause them problems it was absolute capitulation wasn't it compl um complete I watched some Everton fan pods afterwards cuz I wallowing in other team's misy and um they were just saying you could smell it you could smell it in the ground and like the the fear in the players the minute they got one goal and it's like yeah I've been there with Forest I I've seen it I mean I remember the Sheffield United semi F in the playoffs when they pulled one back and suddenly you could just sense that all the confidence was going it was only a matter of time for more goals to consider and that's how it was in that game five minutes was crazy it was such an undy like end to the match because you know the balls were coming in and there was players unmarked on the edge of the area like Everton had a breakaway and and they actually tried to attack and then Bournemouth won the ball back and pushed and Everton weren't bringing all their men back like hurridly to defend it wasn't like they were defending with 10 men behind the ball there was like massive pockets of space for for Bournemouth to attack D must have been I was gonna say tearing his hair out he he has got much of that but he must it's worrying he worrying what's going on at EV that's for sure um let's look at some attacking data um and some ofam I just going to say quickly there's there's that game and then it's Wolves and IP switch and although I think those games look amazing from an attacking perspective and you'd expect them to score lots of goals I still think from a defensive perspective Everton wolves nips switch isn't as easy as it as it might look on paper not when we're talking about yeah Derby factor and then the nip switch I think are are G to get him because I think um uh what's his name up top dap I can never remember dap's name dap up top is going to cause them isses yeah Lively and in it switch I think of all the promoted sides are the ones that are going to pose the biggest attacking threat we haven't seen it yet which brings me to the attacking date we haven't seen it yet and it switch bottom of this table for team dat attack XG non penalty per 90 .40 the reason why they're down there though is because they've had the toughest opening three fixtures I believe I do believe that we will see more from them but having said that you know 6.33 shots per 90 is woeful um but the fixtures have been against them so I am interested to see what they do now that the fixtures ease up for them somewhat um but yeah no surprise to see it switch and leester down the bottom s anonin 14th 1.16 more favorable but um I think of the three promoter sides it's which the one I'm looking at they they've signed some smart players I think and I think they've got you know Leaf Davis someone who I I said Leaf there um a player that could offer an option in defense uh in terms of attacking returns and I think they've got a sprinkling of talent including dap like you mentioned so I expect to see yeah halfway line drove and just banged it in I mean yeah great goal not what you'd expect from a a promoted Striker but obviously he was he was in the championship last season on loan part of the city graduates um so you expect him to be quality and he's starting to show it but I think it's which will climb this table I don't think they'll climb to the Heights and at the very top we see Liverpool there who are absolutely dominant what the stat that I pick out here although it's 2.37 non penalty per 90 it's the big chances over five big chances per game crazy that I mean that is massive um and obviously we're expecting that to Plateau a little bit but the next two fixtures are are good two home games um obviously forest with good underlying numbers but you'd still expect Liverpool to to you know to have chances in that game and then Bournemouth at home when when harland's away and I think that's what kind of taking me into the Realms of thinking I want to get Salah in because that Bournemouth at home game looks great when harland's got that that tricky match and then it's who do you Captain otherwise because if if I've just got Harland and sacka as my two premiums I don't really want to Captain either of them in in that match so then I'm either taking a punt on on someone else uh in in five um but there's no one I really trust at the moment or I go for go for sell yeah what we're talking about is the Liverpool Bank of Pies which starts now which is a group of four fixtures which we always wanted to Target Forest Bournemouth wolves away and then Palace away and the reason why that's of interest is because in the middle of that Harland plays Arsenal uh and then goes to Newcastle yeah and Newcastle away traditionally one of the hardest away games and he might find it difficult there I me all at the moment he's not finding anything too difficult but you got to say if you're comparing harand to C over this next four you would say that salah's got a good chance of outscoring harand right given that he's kept pace of himself so far yeah they got they've got identical points at the moment yeah 41 points I mean that is that is that is ridiculous I wasn't expecting that the main reason why I didn't go with him I thought I thought you know the points might be shared a bit more between Liverpool and it turns out they were just all getting them except for bloody J apparently Trent I mean how Trent hasn't got an attack in return yet I I don't know because that offside was I mean Salah didn't need to touch that did he um and then and then Trent's getting a double digit in that he could have had an assist in in the first game lot of what ifs and maybees but I think he's been genuinely really unlucky not to Not to Come Away with with more points but yeah you look at this St and think yeah with two home games to come and then wolves and then Palace I mean that isn't exactly a bad game the way Palace have started you want to be trebling up I think on Liverpool in in some capacity yeah I I think we you know I mentioned that Liverpool becoming maybe more pragmatic under slot but it's not detracting from their attack and data obviously it's been the perfect start you know three wins no goal was conceded um slot looks confident and we maybe questioned some of his methods in handling man management maybe with Trent in particular but there's no there's no question he's getting results and and Liverpool are that FB points machine we needed them to be um you know with harand so dominant it would have been a pretty tedious start to the season if Salah Haden have kept pace as he has because then you know we wouldn't be sitting here even deba whether we go harand because he would be absolutely dominating but the fact that Salah with a Liverpool team that looks like they're going to be scoring goals regularly Sal is a viable option which is what we need and now we need other players to join that we need we need son to step up when he sacker to step up to rival Holland otherwise you know we just don't want that one player dominating things do we yeah I'm still I'm still I did an article um for for sports casting which you can you can see on my Twitter which was I was looking if I was going to Wild Card this week what route would I go down would I go you know Salah only well no cuz I want I don't think I'll be wild carding out Harland uh right now would I go Harland only or would I go for for both and even though I'm thinking of getting both in my team this week doing that sacker and esack move I don't really like the idea of wild carding and having both just because when you look at what it does to the rest of your side you you're basically stuck having to play three five fives every week and okay those five fives are under aren't bad because I'm looking like Min Rogers and J Pedro for example they're not a bad three but you're kind of locked in to them so what happens if like a saos light emerges and you want to move and you need to find an extra million from somewhere or you want to get Robertson or you know Arsenal's you know um fixes turns soon you want to get an Arsenal Defender you want to get sacker it's it becomes very inflexible and things change very quickly in the next few weeks so I think I would still go for just Harland if I was walk carding this week and it's what put me off doing it in this in this PR Bas it's funny actually you changed your um your your profile image on Twitter and um it's thrown me completely because I saw this article on Twitter saying oh do you want to go Sal and harand I thought well that's handy I'll have a read of that and then I realized it was written by you and I was I haven't read it you're about to pay me oh that's the best no no don't don't think there was a compliment coming because yeah I mean I think I think the biggest thing for me when I look at teams that are and this is you know one of the the big topics at the moment is about you forgoing sacka to bring in Salah is it's the fact that Arsenal's fixtures although they're really tough over the spell we're looking at here from 4 to 12 they're like third from bottom on the ticker they've got Spurs and city next and that's what's dragging it down but there's also a bad run from gameweek nine 10 and 11 when they face Liverpool at home Newcastle away Chelsea away now you know that's a tough run but in between that sandwiched in between that is in game week six Leicester at home and in game week seven s an at home those are probably the two best home fixtures you can have and they get them back to back and even without odard there if he isn't back by then you'd still back Arsenal to score goals get clean sheets and so if you're moving away from Arsenal in order to get money for sa for Salah you've got that problem of gameweek six and seven haven't you well I think it pretty much locks me into a wild card in six right doing these moves which I don't think is is the worst thing in the world because I want to be able to take advantage of that fixure anyway and probably double up triple up on on Arsenal uh over that time but I can't be going into at the moment I've got no arsal Defender and I probably well I won't have sacker if I take him out for for Salah so how am I going to move back to those for six I'm not really going to be able to so I think that's that's going to be a wild card in in six for me if and when I go ahead with it because yeah I'm I'm going to go ahead with it yeah I I think yeah I without an Arsenal Defender I can absolutely see why doing it because you're you not only are you not going to have sacker you've got to get an Aral Defender as well for that for that run um I get it I think if you did have an arsal Defender though if you were in that situation would you be thinking twice about selling sacka because you kind of you are committing the Wild Card really aren't you yeah I mean if it's just one transfer you could in theory do Salah back to sacka and would you do that though when when salah's salah's going to wolves and Palace wolvves W that's it you're going to be selling Sal is is is away at wolves I mean if I Wild Card though it's probably going to be the same boat because like I said I'm probably not going to go with harand and Salah so then I getting rid of Salah away at away at wolves um and I mean he's he's cap he's probably the best Captain option that week isn't he because like you said harland's got Newcastle Newcastle away so maybe it's a case of holding off until seven to to walk C sell out um when he plays Palace away which it's still a pretty good fixture but it's not as you can catch in saaka surely are you not going to do that you're not going to catch inaka to Leicester yeah maybe I don't really trust zaka as a captain you're not don't know well you I mean you captained him and got six points yeah yeah I mean his ceiling does feel like it's lower than harand for sure I get that but he's a consistent points machine like I I have no doubt he will get returns in those two games whether he'll get double figures that's the big issue isn't it I guess I mean you'd expect him to get at least one I mean if he doesn't get one double digit Hall against leester and Southampton at home like you said there's two best fixtures you can have um it's going to be interesting period that because you're going to want all three of those players and yeah you you can do it but like I said you're you're you're going to be massively um low in other areas of your of your team so you're not thinking of wild card into that scenario I I will I'm not ruling it out but would I wild card into Salah har and sacka and Trent and then have to with all the all the low all the other Dr that I'm going to have to have in my my side um I mean that's not even take into account you know Palmer for example who's got Brighton at home in six and then then Forest at home in seven two home games for him he's incredible at home last season it's a it's a real dilemma it is and I think we're sitting here in game week three or four and it's like are we confident enough that we know the where the value is like you know we can get to midfielders in a bit and we look at um Min seeno there are players there that you think well they can at a 55 fulfill the role of enablers to to to get me to a place where I could get those big hitters in yeah but we we're only three game weeks in and so like you say someone could yet emerge as a major bandwagon that we want to move to and then you're you're cut off from making that without making multiple transfers obviously so it is it is early yeah well the other option is you don't go for sack and you go for um have yeah up top and and if you've got um isack for example well isack in six has got Man City so that feels like a good time to he then immediately goes into Everton off the back of that um but maybe that's you know if you can't move for for sack because you don't want to lose your your C and Harland maybe that's the way you you attack those those two because yeah up up to now havs has been outscoring sea so might not happen carry on happening but at the moment you could back you could have a go but not having sacker for Leicester and Southampton at home is a worry you're going to be especially after what I saw against Brian because like you said he could have hold in that he just sometimes finds a way not to get all the points that he he deserves um but what I will say is we're gonna touch on the impact that OD guard's absence could have on Arsenal and sacka later in the show and maybe that's a factor obviously havitz has been playing up front and he's not you don't think he's going to be with odard out it's whether or not odard is back for gameweek six and seven which he could be and we just we've yet to hear the the length of the injury we're thinking three weeks could be a month right that's what that's what the talk is but not been confirmed as yet um we'll get on to that in a bit let's look at goalkeepers low so I was going to ask you about um for buan because you know we're waiting for four or five option to stand out because at the moment the heavy hit of goalkeepers and say that mildy because they're five5 so it's not a big outlay at the moment it's still Allison and ryer out on top and it looks like you know if you went and spent the money that's been well spent at the moment but we're braced for a four five to break through and when they do that could be where you save uh and when people wild card in six Maybe by then there's enough confidence in a four five to move there it could be fleen with great fixtures for brenford for example but you've also mentioned for buen and you've also mentioned the rotation between the two of them yeah put my neck on the line a little bit last last time we one of these when I said the BR was going to reclaim that spot from from still I didn't you know expecting him to get a bloody low move or something but luckily he came straight back into the side I I do really like for Bren I like him as a goalkeeper I like I said I do think Brighton's defense in the medium to long term will improve um the trouble is you want him for the next two because that's when we got two really really good home fixtures and I I'm not really sure what happens in those I think we we we should keep at least one clean sheet across those but I wouldn't be too surprised if we conceded in in both um but if you if you go over to the the fixtures quickly um I mean ver Bren and fleen have got just an unbelievable rotation um you obviously would bring in ver bran playing this week for I switch and and Forest and then you'd play fleen for West Ham and and wolves uh you can also then play him in Manchester United as well which is an awful Brighton got Newcastle away and they always find a way to beat us so I'd probably stick with fleen in that one but then you play for Bren uh with Wolves at home and then you move back to fleen and you have full Bournemouth and Everton so the toughest fixture from now right up until gameweek 12 is that decision between Manchester United or Newcastle the rest is as good as it gets I think the the only thing with that is if you're planning on doing it a bit later you don't really need for Bren because you can just keep fleen so I'm I'm seeing teams you know wild carded with just fleen F the next two are rough and you're probably not going to get clean sheet either of those but then from then you've saved the0 five and you can just play flicking across across the board but if I was doing it right now I think I'd go with both I'd counter it as well by saying you know you're spending 9 million on a keeper there you're getting two four fs and you can get for nine five for an extra not five you could get Ry or Allison right so it's like the degrees of savings you're getting then goes down and then you've always got to get the rotation right whereas you can just stick Ry and Allison in and then forget about it so it's whether that not five is going to be worth it um and it I'm you know I'm a big advocate of saving money and team value so yeah there's no question it could be at some point I think at the moment again it's it's too early for us to know which is the best route to go but flecken from six looks very good and um he will be the go-to for wild cards at that point there's no question just because of the fixtures but also yeah 17 saves made so far um he hasn't kept the clean sheet they've conceded four goals in three games which isn't terrible but 17 saves is by far in away the most saves on show here so flein is what we knew he was um you know some someone who makes saves a lot of saves in a game as a result any bonus yet because what's interesting is no Keepers kept no Keepers got any bonus without keeping a clean sheet as yet which is what we expected because of the anywh near nowhere near no so you're not I mean fleen might get you save points but don't expect that to be coupled with a bonus Point here and there because it doesn't look like it's going to happen this season um and obviously the flip side of that is that Ray has been fortunate in that they have conceded shots he's made 10 saves and in the two clean sheets that he's kept he's got an average of two bonus points so yeah you've got to keep clean sheets to get bonus as a keeper it seems yeah um I mean the boat it's still cheaper to go with the two four FS than go for for Ray and and a four so you're still saving a bit of money there and obviously You' then pair it with a Gabrielle or a CBA to to cover the the Arsenal defense um and you could bench them for the next two if you don't think they're going to keep you know if if you think they're going to concede and then bring them in I mean I think Allison's at still a nogo though because I still think you want to keep that third Liverpool spot yeah available so it's Ray it's Ray or well it's Ray the rotation or just flecken I think they're your three options I wouldn't be going near anyone else yeah and I think we're going to see the the movement towards fleen but I I don't I mean I'm not going to sell rare I don't think maybe I might do on the Wild Card depending on when that comes out but um at the moment I'm going to hold tight and see if a 4 five really a strong four five really does a m so it's questionable whether brenford Ed those fixtures it is an incredible run though and so fleen I'd expect fleen to emerge but we'll see we'll see how it turns out pford miserable 24th look at that yeah I mean it's just been 10 goals conceded he has made nine saves so he could yet be a four well he could yet be I was goingon to say 4 five he's not he was five million which obviously he stacked against him he's gone down to 49 as a result of the start he's had don't see him being a factor um in our season at all Grog day isn't it from last season exactly what we said last year you know they conceded loads of goals in the first few weeks he looked absolutely Dreadful people wild carded him out got rid of him and then D got them playing and you know turn turned around um but I mean they there's nothing positive really the only thing positive about Evon was that they should have been outside they honestly should have been five nil up I think in that game against Bournemouth I thought they were brilliant particularly in the first half but then PF pford made a mistake he's I think that might even be the second one he's he's been he's um because it was against Spurs wasn't it he he did the clanger for for son yeah just took off his T knocked him yeah another one in this and you know when you've got you know one of your star players doing that you've you just ask him for trouble um so they need to massively turn it around but I just don't see it for now D has either got well it will turn i d would be gone because um you know he can't keep losing games by this margin so he's got a turn for them I me you know we'll see maybe pitford can do what he did last season it should help us yes absolutely I mean he's a key player isn't he uh Defenders uh Trent reigning Supreme 0.67 next y on penalty per 90 ahead of the pack I mean the chasing pack as it stands here are Coleman milinkovic and uh sigar santom it's not going to stay like that those three will drop away it's just because of the sample size Trent won't drop away though Trent will be there all season I think yeah oh do you remember Coleman back in the back in the Glory Days moring I remember going for Bain over Coleman and it was an absolute disaster that was a debate wasn't it Baines over Coleman the answer was both I think but I remember Coleman out Coleman outscored him um was toward the end of of Bane's like Legacy uh yeah Coleman was a great asset though I loved it but yeah he he's not gonna stay he's not gonna stay this list Trent yeah is is he's he's gonna hit a massive hole soon I'm sure he is he's gonna he's gonna hit a I don't know 12 13 pointer and I think it could well be in the next two weeks against one of these two teams at home so if you're wild card in six you're keeping Trent I can't see unless slot drops him or it looks like he's massively falling out of favor or gets injured I can't see losing Trent can you I think he's just he's gonna get close to 200 points for seven million in a defensive slot yeah I I I see it that way I I just I just think that it'll take one big hall and then we'll see huge bandwagon I think it just hasn't arrived as yet um um yeah British 87 saying um is it no it's Nica saying suara suar suara won't drop he has got a very good that can't be right ITA yeaha siga um he has got a good reputation going forward and um the numbers here may be sustainable I mean the only reason why I think he'll drop is because sampton as an attacking team won't allow him to sustain that he has got he has got the goal of course um already and maybe there could be potential there as a four five box but I don't know ever play ever gonna play him well unless he's going to emerge as elaf Davis threat and you know because I do see him as being a four five and he's down in 18th in this table with 0.13 X on P 90 well below Sara but I expect I expect Davis to climb that table as soon as it Rich's fixtures soften up so he for me still the one that I would go with if I was going to look for a four five from a promoted team of course Romero and porro pretty solid I'd expect them to remain near this near this kind of area certainly porro um we're not going to go for Spurs for clean sheets all season but porro is a player that's still hanging on in a lot of teams um probably will remain in my team for now porro for Robertson is what I'm looking at Robertson is 0.26 somewhat behind Trent now do you think there's an argument there do you think the million Gap can be bridged what him and Trent no no no I think you know sometimes you've got to pick your battles when you're trying to cost cut and I just think Trent's got so much more to his game than than Robertson than Robertson has um I mean is Robertson six was he six5 he's six isn't he same as same as van D yeah six yeah yeah okay so because it was that van was the cheapest wasn't it and then Robinson was like one step up and then Trent was was the thing so I mean he's I'd definitely go for him over over van dijk but i' I'd find the extra I'd find the extra million for for Trent I just I just think Trent is non-negotiable for me he would he would be just be the first player in my in my team I think you could even build a case for not going with harand like you have not going with Salah anyone else I just if I see a team without Trent I just think you're risking you're risking it here that is that is a seven million asset taking up a a spot that you have to play a player in who's gonna hit a massive hole at some point to Too Much seventh eight nor 0.27 he's the one that could emerge when the fixtures get better for walls but they don't get better for a really long time I mean it's Newcastle and Villa next home Villa away then Liverpool then brenford away then City it's Dreadful I mean that not until really I mean you can't say Brighton away is EAS so you got to get to game week 10 you yeah you say yeah and is on even going to be in charge by then I hope so but if they lose every game up until gameweek 10 then there's going to be questions asked isn't there so yeah eight Nory could be someone we look at because these numbers are really impressive shots per 9 1.72 Chan cre 1.29 he's played left wing back now um in a back three which I think will be the preferred system while they ride out these tough fixtures so he will he will remain in this top 10 I think and he'll be someone we'll look at should O'Neal be there and they're still playing Wing backs and then I want to talk about Lewis and viio because V's crept in no honestly V's crept he wasn't in this table last week but he's crept in after more attacking display .22 they're I mean V's the goto if you want security but they're by Far and Away the city options aren't they at the moment yeah Lewis is is the interesting one of what you do again if you're on a wild card um what what you do with that I mean cardio had an xgi of 0.55 that was mostly from I think one good chance that he that he created he's still not the marauding asset that we that we wanted and when you've got Lewis there at 47 he's obviously very very attractive um you need to have a bench that kind of covers it if you're wild carding I I guess you go safe and you pick like a dunk or you know mikeno see there's gavves now formul in and face um so you can get rid of your Ben Johnson's and your barcos and and not have to worry too much about it but I still want a bit more data on on Lewis I still want to see a couple games this Arsenal games that's coming up is going to be massive because if Lewis starts in that then and plays 90 again and then you've got five weeks have been playing 90 and he started the most important game you know one of the most important games they couldna have all season then clearly he's got that kind of sewn up but Walker's lurking foden back in training and and lurking around yeah I think I would punt on him but I'd want to give it a couple more weeks but yeah you must be loving having you got little price rise out of well up to 47 got a couple of them yeah got a couple out of him yeah I mean that was the gamble like I bought him for one game and hoped he would play well enough to keep his place I mean he was impressive for England as well I just y he hasn't put a foot wrong yet so but we know pep like he he could let him down but the way he's talking about him I think that he's there now I think I think he'll have a place in that side I don't know what that means for Walker whether Walker gets Europe we'll have to see and that's what we want the answers on and that'll be the case very soon niik Williams in 11 seen a few mentions of him in chat the only query there yeah he is far forward yeah shots per 90 2.33 chances created one per 90 been an impressive starts the season for Williams that we've had easy fixtures what I would say is Moreno has been bought he could go at left back and Ana could then get right back Ana for me is a superior Defender to Williams and I think he he's good enough going forward as well so Nico not nailed long term so beware if you're thinking of doing that I wouldn't do that and well when we get get our draft video out of our of our bickering we've got Moreno there you you assured me with as much Vigor as I did with Barco that Moreno was gonna ask uh was gonna ask Williams from from the side so I'm expecting Moreno to be in very soon and Williams to be out or I will be very yeah no I think I think Maro will start it's a different his quality going forward is is really strong um neither Williams or or Ana can offer that and I think we need that that side because it does unlock H Ado more to have a natural eff foot or outside him because at the moment we got a problem where we the fullback doesn't go around k h Ador and Hao wants to come inside so we don't have that threat around to overlap him so Moro gives us that so you can see the logic know I think I I'd get Moreno I love I love watching Moreno play if he's actually is he nailed down like a moring fullback role for a as we've seen a good defensive side under under Nuno in terms of the stats he could be an absolute steel at four five yeah if we if we keep the good defensive data going through tougher fixtures so I mean this is a good test for us now we go to Liverpool and then we've got an easy game at Brighton but after that he really does s up you're going you're going to that I'm going to that looking forward to it yeah but we can't do it again we cannot do the game what are you doing now what you you going I'm in Madrid I'm in Madrid and and I messed it up I think because when we were thinking of dates um I had the forest game in mind but i' put put forest in the wrong week on the calendar I'd put it for this week coming forward so I'm I'm going to the IP switch game on Saturday but I thought that was The Forest game I know AB well last year you you had already had plans concert yeah want to see pay you can't turn that down they might not be play might not be alive much longer let playing the music so um yeah have to go to the city grounds um you know in the new year we've got to do it because we keep threatening to do a vlog while we're there as well and will enjoy that we do a live stream after ridiculous we haven't got gone but yeah absolutely uh we'll talk about Ben White just down there in 45th um he is aead of Anthony Robinson who's been the star for many FB teams so far this season but Ben White hasn't created a single chance yet nothing from him so um expect that to Pi uh to pick up but not justifying the price tag at the moment for Ben go CRA I'd still go CRA yeah yeah no fair enough uh let's look at mids oh h on whoa whoa whoa there's a play where do you want me to go where do you want me to go we have to talk bright Defender Lucas Dean oh you don't want to go there if you're gonna talk people in the G Luca Dean you are and you me unless I mention Luca Dean even if it's to say don't go there I've put him on there but if you're gonna chat people up into going Luca Dean you're asking for trouble after what you did to start the season no I'm I'm going to do the complete opposite I'm going to say that for anyone who might be newer to Fantasy Football or whoever who isn't quite familiar with lucaon to me he is the number one worst troll in FPL there it is there he is there is no one more of a I remember starting with him a few seasons ago and his underlying stats are really good he got like blank blank blank and then scored own goal and then they conceded in like in like the 90th minute I think he scored an own goal and that is owning Luca de he can be as good as you want he can have all the great stats great fixtures for Villa I promise you you bring him in you'll regret it don't go there that's that's my that's my you know Happ next big Hall coming big Hall coming for because he's that's what he does when you think he's he's gonna do well he doesn't whenever you think he's gonna do badly he's hilarious because he find he finds different ways each time and they get more Bizarre by the minute don't they like he'll get booked in the last minute when he's just about to get free bonus or something he crazy yeah honest never known I've never known a player so consistently troll people who go there it's unbelievable oh Darwin's getting there but yeah well yeah to be fair Darwin is Darwin and Dean right up there uh midfielders uh you have to have one start to appear on this table which is why gacho is right at the top but he's only had 124 minutes a very small sample he exra on penalties is 1.19 he's right at the top of all midfielders but then like this week you know we get to the Quality sorry was as I like G this week yeah yeah there's no question he's a good player he's not going to be number one for XG on penalty over the season he is going to drop down but I expect him to be there or thereabouts in the 30 for sure Salah will probably be top in his table for most of the Season he's there one extra non penalty per 90 at the moment and then Diaz 0.94 de BR a 0.93 yeah Diaz incredibly High um and I want to bring up you know we've got our key performance indicators so I've got those again I just want to bring them up again because so this table is basically showing midfielders this season who have improved on their XG non penalty per 90 compared to last season gacho right at the top 0.79 we go down to Diaz though so he's improved his XG non penalty per 90 by 0.37 um but if you look across he's also improved his shots in the Box per 90 by 0.22 N9 and his chances created by 90 by 0.60 so Diaz at the moment even though it's a small sample we've got a combination of the ey test and this data to suggest that Diaz unders slot is a different player now it is too early we can't jump to conclusions but how much longer do you leave it before you have to start thinking Diaz has to be in our teams well again to talk about the draft because that was kind of window into what we were thinking we were we had a brief discussion didn't we about whether to draft jur or or Diaz because we could have had either I think it was our it our third pick wasn't it we could have had either and in the end we both agreed that Diaz was was the one to go for and at the start of the season I think we both would have said I mean I went for jotter over Diaz um obviously J's our biggest biggest fan uh but you were I mean you also whal about about Diaz but I think we both probably would have picked y but it's been a couple of weeks the itest supports Diaz as the stats support um Diaz as well I guess you've got that slight worried about the international minutes this week the fact Darwin hasn't traveled anywhere I do wonder if he's going to give him a chance in in the team over over Diaz but the way Diaz has been playing be a bit risky wouldn't it to I think Diaz starts he might only get an hour but I think he starts yeah I just think he's just won all three games scoring goals Diaz is on fire and um I watched him actually I watched him in the in the Internationals I watched him play for Columbia against Argentina he didn't he didn't Sparkle to be fair so I was I was just interested to see how he perform in that but he has it's just the positions he's taken up for Liverpool that he is kind of hitting that that narrative that he would get more Central he would get more far post and obviously the cross is coming over from Trent and Salah that's where the creativity is is all that side it's all right side isn't it right Salah their most creative player after Trent and then you got Soso that side as well so we did say like if if the service is going to come in it does seem that J's not being that big number nine getting on the end of stuff it's Diaz Coming Far post get on the end of it is J gonna become the new firmino who drops back still does all right but it's Manet and cah who were the ones back then and I think I said before the manchest United game I didn't think Diaz has the potential to score as many goals as as man did but two really well taken goals against Manchester United two different types of goal as well and obviously the Counterattack goal he scored the week before that so he's scoring all different types of goals getting into the right areas like we keep saying stats are good everything you he's he's one to back I think because there's no real reason why that should digine decline you'd think if he's still getting the chances hopefully that would improve and he'd actually you know carry carry on doing well because he's clearly in the Elite Talent it's just amazing that like Gordon was so heavily linked wasn't he with with Liverpool yeah and I think if Gordon had signed I don't know how close they were signing Gord if that had gone through I wonder if Diaz would even be at the club right now because you presume he's going to play left side right yeah yeah you think so he not Gordon coming to take salah's place would he so they're paying 75 million orever it was for for Gordon I mean that could have been complete nonsense and maybe they were never really in for Gordon but there was a lot of rumors about it maybe agents Al for contract yeah maybe yeah um let's all back to B because um he was unlucky at West Ham um disable Luke Williams bought him um and was um was waxing liverpol about how he's gone Maverick again and he was unfortunate not to get return the in that game yeah and but he stands out well here does he 0.23 is xgi up per 90 compared to last season interesting chances created a down 0.62 so he's not really that creative Force yet but shots are up 0.82 so he's being more direct fre game small sample Etc de Bry never going to be a factor I guess foden coming back really puts a shadow over it right did you see that interview he did about his Pace in the news um EA Sports FC game he's he's been given 67 pace and he got his FIFA card he looked and he was like think they must have red me when I was on crutches last season which I thought was was very good I hope so I mean foden is an interesting one isn't he because if Lewis continues in that Central Midfield spot and Walker doesn't come back you know foden I mean it's ridiculous to think the player of the season last year might struggle to find his way back into the team but City have looks so effective in those first few games um that does foden automatically come straight back into the side probably but causes a bit of disruption to the way the way s been playing I mean if if things are as as they are now I think de bruyne is a good option going in from game week seven because the fixures if you go back to the fixures for man city um after that Arsenal man and Newcastle game were out the way you know full and wolf Southampton Bournemouth it's a brilliant run of four games so we might be looking to pair har up with with someone for those and if foden isn't really in the picture then de bruyne is the next best option because you would really trust anyone else yeah I mean I'm looking at that period I mean when I'm going to play my w I'm not sure at the moment I'm thinking maybe between seven and eight which is the next International break and game week eight is when I'm probably GNA have to get on a city player because I can I can maybe Captain Salah or sacka until then um because sack's got saned at home game week seven but you know when harand faces Fulham so maybe I can I can play my sacker against your Harland but certainly after that when Harland goes to wall s Anon B with if I'm not getting Harland surely I've got to get some kind of City attack there um and I need foden to be back otherwise you're right maybe it will be maybe we'll be looking at um at De bruyne and he you know he's showing he's showing a different player so far um but it's it's free matches we'll see if that continues I wanted to mention matoma here as well um because he's he's increased his extra on penalty per 90 by 0.18 um his other factors are all down though touches in the Box are down shots per 90 down as are shots in the Box he's getting some traffic this week because of the fixtures um where' you stand on him well I was I was kind of all in on him before before this week I had my my transfers planned before the I was Ring Watkins in for esack and I was going to ring matoma in for for Gordon I was pretty locked in on that and then I saw what happened with with Salah and I saw what happened with with J Pedro as well getting a getting that goal and getting another 90 and also the fact he wasn't supposed to be going on International Duty and then gets bloody Co up anyway because of because of an injury but we'll talk about him when the forwards come around um it kind of put me off off mat a bit obviously there's M there there as well for for a little bit cheaper but I really do like the matoma pick and I think his I think particularly against IP switch I think he could do really really well in that game because he's got I mean I'm sure most people listening to this have seen matoma play but he's an incredibly like talented and tricky player but he's got one move which just is so effective against weaker oppos opposition which is he gets the ball kind of just outside the area he basically brings it to a complete stop and then he just kicks it really far past the defender and just runs onto it and then just um centers it into the into the penalty area and I'll tell you that is going to cause who who's it going to be a right back Ben Johnson or whoever is playing you'd think Ben Johnson yeah he's gonna he's gonna ruin the right back with that rip switch I just think him against newly promoted teams is is going to be so so effective um because he was getting some Joy um you know in in other games this season not so muchal well exactly against against ashy L absolutely terrorized him so when he's playing against a maybe a less adapt right back he's going to be very effective um the touch in the Box for 90 is a bit concerning minus three um on that but yeah the ex number 90 is a bit higher because I think that's being that's been quite affected all for him um like it's interesting Salah is the only really big hitter here amongst the midfielders you you look up the list and yeah Bruno's up there so he's 8.4 and he has improved 0.27 Improvement on his extra on penalty per 90 which could be of interest could be enough for people to hold him for one more week but salah's in there you know so salah's XG on penalty is up as are his touches in the Box per 90s so and he shots in the Box per 90s so the key performance indicators are shown that Salah he's not in Decline it's going almost the what you make of his um what do you make of his comments after the match because they you know they said to him what's happening with the contract or whatever and he said didn't he um this is my last year at Liverpool and I just want to enjoy it yeah I I don't know whether that is Bluster to see if we what they can offer I don't think it's going to affect him people have said you know do you think he's going to like um simmer down as the season goes on as he's winding down and is he off to Saudi I mean I guess that would be the most likely out come I think I think Liverpool are going to be talking aren't they they're going to be thinking you know he's going to be going I think he's going to continue to prove to be someone who can be elite I don't see him declining as yet and Slot seems to be getting the best out of him so far and he's super fit so he can carry on playing in the Premier League there's no question it's whether or not he there desires of stays there I don't know it's interesting isn't it and you know they' got van dijk on the last year as well and and there was speculation about Trent so yeah yeah so you know is this the end of an era and are Liverpool going to go Full Tilt for the title because of that is it going to be a motivational factor I don't know it is interesting to that I don't think that's gonna impact fbl at the moment though there's no sign of that it's just sometimes when you've got these contracts I look at Tony last last season you know he he just went completely off the boil didn't he um I me was I mean do you remember aubameyang when he signed a new contract and he didn't score for like an entire season as well so you can make as many narratives as you want about it but the fact is there is this thing going on with Salah he said it's his last year and he started the season maybe even better than he started any of the last couple couple of years if you were playing top trumps and and the top Trump category was professionalism and you had Salah aubameyang and Tony who would have professionalism very good very good point yeah yeah so I think it's a different kind of fish isn't it salah's not someone who's gonna I don't know he's he's not gonna let perform think that about aubameyang at the time though wasn't he and he'd been scoring 20ish goals and got the goals in the FA Cup and he was kind of like the Talisman of the the side um I don't know what what really happened with that and now obviously all the stuff happened with Chelsea and at Barcelona his reputation's kind of in the mud but at the time it seemed when when they gave him that they give like a fiveyear deal or something it seemed like that was a really good bit of business yeah I really want people to invent top trumps with professionalism for footballism who' be top who' be top of your professional Harry Kane maybe I don't know is he professional I think he is given how long he stayed at Spurs out winning anything that's true um there's a lots of comments about bourou midfielders um why would you buy too seeno toer we're sleeping on toer um says Neils apples wow lots of the number of B yeah yeah is tavir so I'm having a bad night with pronunciation are yeah um the number of Bourn midfielders that are featuring on this table and the table we're going to go back to is is quite extraordinary Sinister um tavanir seeno uh rutar I got that right see I got all those right can do it when I concentrate so they're all in this table they're all improved on last season um and if we go back to the midfielders table you'll see that they're all there as well they're all up there in the in the top echelons of this table for XG non penalty per 90 Bournemouth as we saw with the attacking date if we go back to that were third I think yeah third 1.95 of the season so what do you put that down to is it I mean the fixures haven't been that easy I mean they're showing red there do you think that um we need to start taking them seriously as a source of value because seeno has been the one that's jumped out so far but maybe he's that it doesn't stop there maybe tavanir could be an option they have played Everton you know that's always a slight boost to to those more I thought I thought they'd struggle more I thought they'd be um I really like I really like Bournemouth as a as a unit um I really like the manager as well and I think he obviously did great things with them I thought losing slanky though would be big adjustment period bigger than we thought but I mean they did have simino who who last season stepped up um you know with with the goals been eight goals to him four assists uh across last season so that that's the difference between him and Taver is Taver never really got anywhere near those numbers I think he got about half or maybe even less of the attacking returns probably like five or six attacking returns last season whereas sea now looks like he's moving up um even more I really really like him at 55 I think he's an option and and I think you know again when we talk about going for H and going for Salah having to play three five fivs I think actually Rogers seeno and Pedro is a pretty decent three who were all all underpriced yeah I was looking at how I could wild C now and get to Salah Harland and it would involve dropping down to a soeno from Sun but I looked at it and thought you know what does that feel like I mean it is a big drop because of the the historical the Legacy that son has got in fbl he's an elite player no question almost almost describable as a heavy hitter he has been in other Seasons but seeno you know when we talked about Diaz as a player who could be exceed in his his value um seeno definitely fits into that bracket as well um and it's it's just how long we we wait before we start going yeah we we really got to take this seriously uh he's definitely he's definitely providing what we hope Rogers would at the moment and I don't know if that's gonna stop and Evan nilson has obviously arrived for Bournemouth but he doesn't strike me as a player who's gonna Cil seeno's attacking um Verve so to speak he's had so many shots he look up for it as well like when just just before it all turned for for Everton you know simenia was involved in a kind of altercation he was he was fired up he wasn't giving up that game despite the fact they were two- two down um so yeah I like that kind of fire about him and the fixures are good I mean Chelsea at home former for would have chance in that they beat them last year didn't they um can't if it was at Sanford BR or if it was if it was at their ground but they definitely they definitely beat quite early in the season but then obviously it's Liverpool then Southampton and Leicester so got that little they B they're Bott of the ticket from game four for 12 so you know out of this run they've got two very strong blue fixtures it's the Southampton Leicester double up that Arsenal have also got um but you know they do have Liverpool Arsenal Villa away City brenford away Brighton at home it's tough it is the toughest run on here so yeah you can be forgiven for ignoring seeno at the moment because of those fixtures but we might be sleeping on him we really might if You' if you've got the ability to bench him in against Liverpool and against Arsenal and then you probably look to take him out after the run but that still gives you three really good fixures I think to make that strategy of going with the the premiums more viable because when you've got Min Smith Rogers um and and him and then Pedro that's five all under six million we have we've never had that before people saying that yeah the move to embo has got to come it has got to come I think he's 15th in his table he's got three goals already in in 269 minutes .63 extra on P think it will stay there he hasn't had a pen yet but that will be did you see did you see the Southampton highlights yes suicide it's exactly what I said at the start of the Season didn't I I said Martin's not going to change and they haven't the thing is they haven't it's like Burnley they don't have the quality to play in that way at this level so I do worry yeah don't get me wrong I think emba is a great pick and I think he's going to be probably a must from from game week six onwards but I just wouldn't take anything from that Southampton game because I they were just it was comical genuinely comical how they were playing the mistakes they were making the invitation for the press against one of the best pressing sides in the league as well why are you messing around passing the ball out from the back like get rid of it I know no one wants to hear people say that I said got Howard Bellis is a good player but Bednar Jack Stevens they're not I mean they're not good strong Premier League Defenders who are good with the ball at their feet I would I mean they're okay they're not you know they're not necessarily really poor Defenders but I wouldn't associate them with being players who are press resistant right so yeah and and and I remember when Martin B Swansea does a city ground we were just catching them and they wouldn't change he just carried on letting us do it and and that's what I fear that could happen to S Anon I hope not because I don't want the promoted scenes to go down but what I saw at brenford was what I thought would happen whether or not Martin does start going a bit more direct he can change because he has done I mean he got the team up by changing the the the approach in the playoffs so we'll see what happens next but yeah they can't do that he he won't have an easier game all season in aumo to get two goals sure it was just ridiculous but he's a quality player there's no question yeah if you're wild card in in six which you you've talked about what are you doing about brenford are you going in bumo you probably have to don't you um the fixtures are so good and he is the best asset from from that side so yeah you probably you probably go at least one Defender and and then bumo um go a Defender would you I think you yeah fleen I mean oh you got youve got vanderberg haven't you we're hoping that he comes in if you got a four million asset with the fixtures they've got that again frees up a bit of money to to do what you want with with other areas he's a good player I think he will get in I think he's too good not to get in that side what who he comes in for would be the question but yeah another player I want to mention just so that we can clip this and say oh look we did mention him I told you uh Jack Gish I think or delete it B I obviously ignore what I'm about to say if he does nothing for the next if he does score next week then yeah it's all down to us want the credit um the numbers suggesting and what we're seeing playing for England as well greish could be turning the tide a bit he's only had 91 minutes and the numbers are up um do you think there's a chance that we could start seeing somewhat the kind of Jack Gish we saw at Villa no you don't see it no because why would he suddenly change the what he's you know he won the treble playing in a certain way which was his best FPL season for City and it wasn't that great it wasn't like we were all I think he was in my team for a bit and he got a couple of returns but he never looked like someone getting 15 20 attacking returns in in that season let's be honest it's not going to get any better than that for him is it that was him playing 90 minutes almost every week for a treble Winning Side this is him barely barely in the side with more competition um n not gonna happen it's interesting I mean talking about Ian right was talking about for England saying that you know to stay in in cary's thinking he's got to be playing for City and and you know he's been he's done the two seasons now he's a he's not a veteran at city but he's certainly a senior player there now um yeah it's staying in that team will he be able to do enough and what role will he continue to play the role where he is he's effectively being the magnet for defense so they can create space which is what he's been there he's not been it's not been about output for greish it's been about sacrificing his own output for the gains of the team um I just wonder whether that's going to change because pep what pep will do which all good managers do is they'll change the way they play they they can't keep playing the same way and they'll they'll reinvent players Within system and so I just wonder whether there's something worth keeping an eye on I'm not saying it's going to turn into output yet but I think it's it's worth certainly when foden is back and we start to see what Pep's gonna do and whether or not he is going to change things up whether greish becomes a different type of greish I'd rather yeah I'd rather pick doco at the moment I think he's just I mean I think even if greish plays we're still not sure he's just going to get the ball recycle it and everything oras at least if you get 45 minutes from do he's going to go we remember we I think was it last season we were like guo's gone out and bought Dau who basically was greish from when he was a villa yeah that kind of tricky tricky Winger yeah we'll see I mean we can't really judge city until they're back to full strength until Rod is there until foden's there and that's that's what we'll see but um yeah I just want to keep an eye on and just thought I'd mention it because it's always nice then go we didn't mention him mention another 10 players and one of them's going to come in surely so uh I's talk about sacka and odard then because sacka has this table 13th 0.72 odard could be out for a while Premier League put this up this is based this is completely ripped off a premier league article but I feel like put format so yeah exactly well I had to do that because it was so blurry and hard to read on their format plus of course they did Miss off shots per 90 even though they mentioned in the article so that was a bit slack of them terrible yeah standards um so I had to put shots for 90 in there now I've highlighted the key stats uh the point points per 90 the Arsenal gain with odard 2.1 um and it's 1.7 without odard so not a major drop but a drop nonetheless uh with odard starting shots per 90 go down from 15.9 to 13.3 and goals per 90 go down from 2.09 to 1.63 so that's the biggest drop the win percentage as well as worth talking about there 66% win rate with odard 52% without him now I look at this think yes there's a drop but then you look below the pink bar there and you look at possession you look at pass the final third passing accuracy passing accuracy opposition's half no difference no difference to that whatsoever so it doesn't really affect their pattern of play without him it does affect their results but that could be down to I mean we're talking about 19 matches with that could purely be down to the opposition right it could be down to so I don't look at this and think oh it's disastrous for Arsenal like many people are saying do you my bigger worry is what we touched on earlier which is having to move havs back and playing a false nine system with with trossard um I think this is this is where you know everyone thought Arsenal would go out and get a striker this time and Jay's had a pretty good preseason I think a lot of trust was was kind of put put in him I'm still I'm still not convinced he's he's the one to be leading the title charge for them for them up front although I did think that about HZ and he's he's obviously stepped up havs is so effective at the moment that taking him away from that role is is what what worries me so it's going to be what hav parte and um who else is going to be in the Midfield H parte and because rice is out guard's out geino gonna come in could do a bit of a a crappy Midfield isn't it they got Sterling right we haven't talked about him is he gonna be a factor yeah I mean he could go he could go up would he go false nine over trossard I'm not going to go I'm not going to start the Sterling false 9 prop my point is that they they're playing Spurs next it's a massive massive game for them spurs will surely be looking at that Midfield and thinking we we can for the first time we can dominate that mids we can dominate that Midfield dominate a big word I think or or or get at them HS parans and um who you who did you you just say georgino yeah yeah I mean georgino is not bad is either but I think I I I really do think that he going to stifle the amount of amount of chances they get in that game and it is Spurs they're going to be leaky but I think they might be relying on more of a from a corner or something like that where Spurs are weak from corners and they've obviously got Gabrielle and and celba I don't know how many open Play Goals or how many chances they're going to create with that with that Midfield um Mr Greg is a regular hello Greg um he's reminded us that Martin and have a sacka trossard they can get some goals I I totally agree so what I mean I'm going to show some more dat let's let's show some more data first this is this is totally ripped off I just rip people off really should put this off an opto analyst I mean I do go to the trouble of finding his stuff and researching and reading the article so thank you very much opter analyst for this stuff this is basically number of involvements in open Play Shot ending sequences which I love as a stat so it's a basically events that are leading to either a chance created a shot on goal or a shot ending uh sequence so he's played a part he's made a pass in a sequence that's ended in a shot he's the top midfielder in the Premier League last season for that so that kind of goes against what I said about two minutes ago where Arsenal miss him so much this would indicate that they would but I will say also look who's third sacka right so they have got someone there who can take that up and and and fill that void to some extent it's not like they're not going to create chances about odard there because they've got an elite player in sacka of course but that is significant you would say um you know there's no question they will miss him deck and rice could arguably be an even bigger Miss so we don't know what we're going to get from Arsenal in this game I'm GNA show you one more graphic again for MTO analyst and this I think if if you if you were to ask Arsenal fans who yeah the one player they would want to not be out of this game obviously it's between rice sacker and and odard but I I think it would be odard I think he's the worst player they could lose for this the captain like the fact the impact has other positions in the team the the way he started the season has been really impressive bad no I'm not I'm not questioning that and then this adds more field to the fire this is the chances created by sacka and um odard as a pairing when they fed each other basically for shots and their combination which I think is yeah 46 chances between them is the biggest of any pairing in the Premier League last season wow didn't know that yeah nicely plagarized mark I know um so you know if if if there's a if there's a narrative to say well sacka would be fine with odard well this kind of suggests that it's a big blow to him because as a pairing they're incredibly effective good news for me as a as a probable seller of sacka this week yeah I mean I I can't I can't really make a strong case for saying it's not GNA have an impact the only thing I would say is that what Arsenal and Man City have in common is they're going to drive each other in every game this season there is no question Arsenal and man city will go into every game and play every minute as if they've got to win that game there are no games that Arsenal or city are going to play where it's one all with five minutes to go where they're not going to go all out to win it now I'm not saying you you would think well that's the case of any team I don't think so I think the intensity in which city and Arsenal play and and fight for every point to the very last minute is higher than any other teams in the league maybe Liverpool will get there this season but the reason why they're top two is because they're driven by managers you will create that Arsenal will go to Spurs regardless of their lineup and they will expect to win and they will fight to win to the final whistle so there's no way that Spurs are going to roll them over two-nil there is no way if Arsenal lose it will be 3-2 4-3 or something ridiculous I don't think Arsenal will lose I think they'll still win the game so I still think Arsenal will score more than one goal possibly two maybe three even without odard and rice because their desire to win every game to win this title and this season they've probably got more chance than any and less OD guards out for ages we'll carry them through I think and therefore if I think Arsenal are going to do that they're going to win the game they're G to score at least two goals I'm not selling sacker yeah I think SPS are goingon to win do you I think Spurs are gonna win it yeah I think again you talk about drive and and all that I think they're going to look at this and think we're not going to get a better chance we're not going to get a better chance in the next few years to to beat AR to beat Arsenal you know the fact it's a home game as well early in the season put a dent in their title charge right now there's no bigger motivation for Spurs they're not as good a team but with the with the missing players for Arsenal it's a lot more even I think that it's be a good game yeah yeah but I just think what I've seen from Arsenal's artetta is they find a way now and I think that they're growing as that kind of Team all the time and I think that yeah these are major blows there's no question and they've got Europe and then they've got City it's a really really tough period for them to lose Declan rice in this one game but also Oar to injury no question I think it is being overplayed in that people are going oh yeah Moreno's out and so on it's like they're not even in the team yet cury is not in the team and you those four names are being mentioned Arsenal are going to be without these four key players hold on a minute two of them haven't even played yet so people want to build this narrative up that they're absolutely crippled by injury they've lost two major key players no question but I still think they're going to win that game and that's why I think that I'm okay holding sacka I wouldn't wouldn't I wouldn't not endorse going sacka to sell out I see the logic in it yeah but I wouldn't be surprised if saaka still comes through and get something out of that game because Arsenal I think will still win it I mean I'm expecting I'm expecting him to get something from from the game um but I don't think it's I I would be a lot more worried when I saw rigar go off I that kind of made my mind up that that sack was going to go I think before that happened I was actually looking at spending the money because I'd already done esack to um to Pedro so you know because I thought there was going to be a double a price drop for for eack and a price rise I got the price rise but obviously not not the price drop um but then I was looking at other things I could spend the money on rather than getting rid of sacka because I thought I can keep him play him against Spurs but once odard got off I thought now that's that's just one that's just an extra incentive now to to take a punt on him not not delivering him next two it just feeds into the narrative though if sck returning that game last season and and if he does you can just see people go yeah but then the odard injury convinced me they'll say oh as Black Box presenting all those numbers partnership yeah true I I mean there need to support selling sacka to go sell and I absolutely see that I mean it's of course it's logical sell's got great fixures sack's in a team without two key players with tough fixures absolutely makes sense the only question I would ask is do you think Arsenal can win at Spurs I think can so if they're going to win at Spurs sack's got a good chance you've done well you've played both sides like a Ab I've nailed my colors to the to the sicker out Mast and here you are genius this is how you get away with this stuff and I don't genius I know years of experience doing this stuff let's talk about forwards um yeah it's a shame about havs because my my tactic ahead of gameweek six is going to be and hopefully still can be Isaac to hav just as you say because I want to get on I really want to go treble Arsenal and if I'm not wild carding then I'll I plan to save two transfers going into six and get inmo and havocs at that point um so if oar's out that could that could dampen my enthusiasm for but he's here he's ninth in the table 0.53 he's got two goals one assist it's been a really good start for um your favorite Sunday League player as yeah yeah he's uh he's started I was definitely put off by the the positional reclassification um a mid moving to to a forward and he needed to basically do what he's been doing and he's been very very effective uh in it um I mean if you've got him you still you still play him don't you I don't think he's a he's a cell he can still do damage from from the eight position that's the position where I wanted to see him last season and I didn't actually think he could make it in that in that nine because we'd seen him at Chelsea playing across all different positions and not really nailing his own he started off from the wing for them didn't he and then sort of moved a bit more Central then dropped back and never really made any position his own well he's definitely made that that nine position his own and yeah I think going into going into those those games against Southampton and Leicester you want sacka you want to pair another attacker really I think for those two it has to be habt especially now OD got out agree yeah um I mean Harlem we don't really need to talk about the only thing I would say about Harland is 71% accuracy 50% conversion that will regress there is no question he can't maintain that whether that means that he's going to have significant regression of XG on penalty I don't know we're expect it to come down somewhat but it'll hover around where it is now 1.05 but he won't get 13.72% 90 so that that will start coming down I hope he had another good chance though that West had four could had four in that game and and I have never when we talk about players going back toback hatrick and regressing I've never been less convinced about regression than I am talking aboutand because brf at home as well it wouldn't be completely out of the Realms of possibility if he got a hat-trick of hat tricks what I can as someone who would go into harand without Harland again is that Frank Thomas Frank is a shrewd tactical manager um brenford are a team who will play fre at the back and they do have physical Presence at the back and I think that I think that they'll do enough to keep him down to maybe one goal that's what I hope um b brenford aren a bad side away from home um they're not going to get skittled three or four nil I don't think and also after International break we often see some drop off yeah clip that not the greish nonsense if I offered you if I offered you a forest one-nil win for a Harland hattrick would you take it yes of course it's a forest one anfield of course I would I'm Forest first fbl second but um yeah be like oh Sal captain Oh three million rank oh be a bit of me like that but you know I I was three million this time last year in the world and didn't there so I'd take it for a one0 forest for sure um yeah I mean Harlem will aggress because that conversion rate that accuracy is not going to continue but like I say you you when you talk about regression you're confident normally but you're not when you're talking about Harland are you at all um wher up there which great to see um I'm not going to propaganda him anymore because being arrogant about having him in my team but Watkins let's talk about Watkins where what are we doing here oh yeah it's an enigma isn't it what's dreon wrong is he's got a niggling injury is he being must must have mustn't he I think it must be like that that salanki injury you know when he was like carrying something but he was kind of still playing and it wasn't bad enough to restr him but um I mean sank game is a bit different to Watkins isn't it Watkins relies more on the pace I'd say to get him behind yeah because slank drops deep and and and slanky can can be involved in in that whereas Watkins needs you know to to hit on the break so it's obviously affecting him more he hasn't been pictured in training has he haven't we haven't seen any training images of him we're talking about Watkins are we talking about neither have neither have as well as it as it stands time stamp Thursday night 11 o' climing 11 o00 but Watkins I mean again before the last episode you and I were esack to Watkins 100% we are not going into Everton at home without Watkins Everton did their best to show us why we shouldn't be going against that because they completely capitulated and Philip definitely gonna get chances against them but another 60-minute Cameo and then not seen or heard of in two weeks I mean they have got Champions League to come right so we know that's that's that's l in and um so that might managing the load is is is something that Emory will have in mind and presumably Watkins is going to be playing Champions League games all of them because of the new format they've got an able Deputy in Duran right so this is always bring that player on and that player is coming on and scoring goals um so it's a worry isn't it we we definitely can't look at Watkins now as an assured asset because we we want more we I mean with the injury time we're not just losing 60 minutes we're losing you know 35 30 minutes we're losing 35 to 40 minutes right and we know that the XG typically in Premier League the XG in in blocks of time is stronger at the end of a game right that's where the greater amount of XG is generated so losing a player consistently for the last 30 minutes is not someone we want so we can't go there yet I I don't think he's ready to play 90 minutes I from what from what I've seen so far I I think it would be more of a surprise if he played 90 against Everton than it would be he either didn't start or played 60 again and because of that playing those odds I don't think you go there he's too much money with so many other good assets around nine 10 million and no penalties which is obviously now going to Morgan Rogers after his was it for the under 21s ringland yeah took it well great Ben yeah great Ben yeah that would be handy it might be the only way he gets us any leeding points well he might get him if Watkins isn't playing because bloody Watkins that keeps messing up his assists it's true Rogers is great I'm keeping him for sure um anyone else you want to pick out here Evan nson good start but only 135 minutes so far Chris Wood is just L does he keep his does he keep his place when's he gonna get dropped yeah um yeah I just don't see Big T Being Fit enough yet um I don't think I I actually think we're going to go Force nine at hfield I don't think Chris Wood will start that that will hurt yell yeah you won't be happy to hear that I I've just got a theory we're going to play James W prows um play Anderson behind Gibbs white and play Sorry have you ever we've done for nine we did a for nine preseason and I think we did it at anfield last season which didn't go well so I I Woods traveling back because he's been in international Duty plus of course I think we need to get James War PR in the team at anfield because with alanga and Hudson adoy win three kicks around the box and you've got you've got someone who can score them right so our best route to goal could be winning three kicks around the box right and we've got players in in Gibbs white Langer and Hudson Andor we've got players who can absolutely do that so I think you know wood would just slow things down and I don't I've got an inkin he won't start um you don't like wood do you I well you can't knock him because uh there's a p because very good because I think it's some like 16 goals isn't it since the since he broke into the team so I think he's scored more open Play Goals than any other any other forward or something ridiculous other than irand so his record is incredible but and he just finds a way but it's the role he plays in our buildup he does slow our attacks down and and he's not I don't know I just think at w anfield the the the graph that we'll get from having Gibbs white in a force n might be the way we go so let's see let's see what happens there's there's a couple more I think we should just cover aware we're reaching the the 2our mark rapidly hav done predictions yet um but I know there's lots of people talking about Welbeck there's lots of people talking about Pedro as obviously he's played 45 minutes for Brazil and he's got the private jet back and all the stuff going around that but I mean which which one of those would you would you go for because I'm I'm seeing this there is a lot of talk about them people are worried about Pedro so they're going for Welbeck yeah I mean shortterm Welbeck but longterm Jiao Pedro I I just I just think herzler likes him he'll get the pens I think it I do think that he'll end up in the nine I mean you know Brighton better than me but I just think he he offers him a bit more than well and well backck you know he's M you got to manage his minutes so you're probably while you're in you know people players like rout are getting up to speed wck starting but I think when when rout is available um we'll see the change and it won't be J Pedro losing his plays I think it'll be world back so I think I can see why we're going world back now because the trip back and you know is is y Pedro going to start I think will I think he will start what do you think I I think he might I think he might come on at halim I saw with matoma last last season um that would be my prediction that he comes on a he comes on at halim but he is the not the fact he's played those 90 minutes in all three games does show The Importance that he's valued at in the side which he wasn't really getting last year so yeah hopefully hopefully starts I mean Welbeck is a good option if you're going to be wild carding in six and there is a part of me that wishes I had gone Welbeck um I went Pedro early because he wasn't supposed to be going to Brazil he was supposed to be staying at home was a shocker wasn't it having a nice little rest um so if I was buying one now and and while cing in six I think I probably would go wellbe you know because I think he's almost certainly gonna start the next next two is he gonna be in the team by game week six yeah he'll start well Beck will start the next two I'm sure he will yeah I just think the longer it goes on and new players bed in M mat R's out so but he's not a factor you've got two you've got two weeks with with Welbeck as as an almost I say guaranteed start because he could miss out in seven um but he's definitely starting this week but yeah Pedro is the much better long-term option yeah and if you've tuned into black box this season you know when as talks about Brighton players you've got to listen oh dear let's talk at our prediction standings um before we get into our predictions and we're we're we're almost neck and neck um in fact we are SC 27 SC I want to talk about hotline at the top or or hottin or whatever you want unbelievable 77% correct outcome I mean that's ridiculous I mean I I know it's only three weeks but even that a 27% correct score as well yeah this is crazy numbers so I yeah we need to tap into what he's doing um because that's crazy I presumably he's a professional gamber and winning a fortune off the boogies every week but that is in I I I sense there might be a bit of a drop off um from from hot you mean it's gonna fall for the floor noran if he continues that over the season then he'd be wishing he played Super six or something rather than just our our stupid our stupid game Shar in hottin I can if you do want to get involved in this uh you can join the blackbox patreon there still time fre game in but you if you want to be winning the the trophy which is is very did you see this oh you've got the trophy we should put a snip of it in shouldn't we next week we'll stick it the trophy now exists it's no longer a figment of our imagination it's been delivered and it was described as very heavy from Richard as well as being very nice of course but there is there is obviously a trophy for the the winner of the patreon blackbox league and a trophy for the winner of the predictions league as well which is currently obviously been one by time I mean it's a heavy trophy but sleeper and manscaper playing for the Post so it's all fine exactly see we do invest back exactly it all goes back into the channel um right predictions now achingly familiar these again aren't they um so ampton man united you've gone two one United I've gone 31 these are very yeah very boring similar aren't they again we don't look at these we just put our scores in and then we only see them when we clip this for the show um okay we're going away we're man united so not too much to talk about there I don't fernandz though yeah come yeah we'll look at the captains in a minute um Brighton it's which both gone 3-0 that be dream me being at the AMX that would be an amazing result Palace leester we've both gone two nil come on mateta get me something the bottom of the forwards list I'm likely to have e more on that in a minute but yes yeah um fham West h both g a draw you've gone to all I've gone one all that might have something to with the fact that Smith row could be going for me so yeah on bench this week you fcy goals do you I found this one probably the hardest one to predict I don't really know I haven't really seen a lot of great stuff from Fulham so far and West Ham obviously were absolutely brilliant against Palace and then awful I mean it is Man City but really really poor against them so I just went with the logical draw I feel enough um and then filam West Ham yeah we've mentioned already Liverpool versus Forest you've gone 3-1 I've G 3-1 31 as well yeah crazy how we go here yeah I think I think we do score I think we do score but then Liverpool kill us off this is different different rather Man City versus brenford I've gone a kind of yeah no bias whatsoever I don't own Harland I've gone two nil you do own Holland You' gone 4-1 hatrick hat tricks Yeah well yeah you see them really giving them a hide in in do you yeah I think so they're just on it at the moment and I mean look at brenford when they play Liverpool they basically rolled over I don't I don't see it I think you know Thomas Frank sides don't do that they they've had some Joy against City in the past as well home and away so I don't know I I don't see it being that I think that City win harand gets something but I've gone two nil uh Villa Everton we're both back in three goals for Villa one for Everton for you I'm going 3-0 though you've gone 3-1 not have contour and I do um it's funny actually I got accused of oh Mark's predictions he only predicts the scores because he's got players his team what a surprise that I predict scores according to my fantasy team of course I do I wouldn't have the players if I didn't think they're G it's crazy some of the things we get accused of you up well you know obviously there is some ages of you haven't seen any of those comments you're not gonna you're not going to not own har and then go oh I think Man City gonna win 7even nil of course you're not you're not going to do that um anyway uh Villa versus Everton we've done bourma versus Chelsea close to being the garden center game but because is an eight o'clock kickoff I don't think we can find a garden center open at that time but you've gone two one I've gone two all yeah I know you fancied him turn them around yeah I can see it because you know Bournemouth started well yeah hav been very impressed with with Chelsea could even beat West Ham um could Palace at home um and I think other than that like mad 15 minutes against wolves um they haven't really been that great I mean they were all right against Man City in the first game um but couldn't really find a way through I like Bournemouth a good team first score we've had first out I know first one yeah terrible home win I've gone a draw next one's this one's different though yeah and this is interesting um and again could be the bias because you're you're selling sacka right and I'm not um what a surprise that it affects our predictions um you've gotten Spurs win and you've told talked about it tonight and you really see this as an opportunity for them 2-1 you're going for yeah it's close um you might be right they might need three maybe to to to do it but yeah I just think I'm gonna I'm gonna back Sam and and say yeah Sam's gonna Inspire them to to a narrow a narrow Victory they'll be delighted would they with a two1 a guitar store at this stage of the season oh yeah I mean they'll only I I reckon they'd wish that it comes at the end of the season and they can you know snatch snatch them from getting the title but it's too early to kill Arsenal's title hopes off but having said that any defeat is going to really hurt when it's Man City you're chasing I think in hope salanki will be back for this well nothing's been seen of him no he was close though they said for the last game against Newcastle I just have an inland he's not gonna turn up again um you know right I mean my my policy has always been with an injury just sell him because I've been on the end of countless man oh he's on his way back and he's oh we think he's back on it you know and it just goes on for weeks and you just never know how much honesty you're getting so I wouldn't be surprised if he's not back you can get Mata like me and get two points every week yeah it's a lot more fun I've gone two on Arsenal I do think Spurs score and I'm probably gonna hold on because I do think this could go you know I think Arsenal win but it could be 3-2 you know there could be a lot of goals here which with the arsal defense you would think no but you're right you're without Declan rice without odard what what are we going to get so it's incredbly difficult game to predict you'd hold it yeah yeah and then the final game which I've identified as the uh as the garden center game it's Sunday 4:30 it's a prime time for garden center really um but we both predicted loads of goals Strang you've gone you've gone 31 Newcastle away win I've gone two all I think it you know I just don't see the defens is standing up here well I'll be back in brunwood watching this with my my parents hopefully my mom's cooking a nice Ro dinner want to play now then don't think he will this would be basically my nightmare result so I've gone the opposite way to you of predicting what would be good for my team because if Newcastle win 3-1 and I've sold esack that is probably going to be maximum pain and I I think isak gets something I really need is I know I'm I'm really not that confident that that sacka and esack is outscored by Salah and Pedro especially if I think Pedro could be benched for 45 I I think it's really really close and using two free transfers on it as well I don't know tempting the fbl gods and we know what they do when we do that I don't I don't feel great but I'm I'm hoping that wolves can find a bit of form at home and Newcastle I've looked a bit labored so far but isach started the season in good form for Sweden obviously scored the goal against against Spurs as well yeah I'm a bit worried you see his comments about FPL managers as well yeah lovely that wasn't it it great and ially said he literally said he was going to score two goals despite me he basically said I love it when people sell me and then I do well yep I mean again it's watching that is horrible isn't it because you can just imagine going oh God and he warned us and there's just so many things that you can see being played back why that game got to be last in the game I could be having a really good game we and it gets to that and then he just goes mad and just ruins me absolutely horrible captains um Isaac features on this table because it's a good fixture of w wolves but we're looking at it's Harem versus Sal isn't it there's no question if you've got both where are you going Harland you are going Harland um he's top of the XJ on penalty 1.05 over sell one um you're going Harland interesting um I I minut before we look at Rob T's data which is always useful we throw it in at this point anyone else you want to pick out here would you be tempted anywh else Bruno Bruno BR after watching Southampton defend last game he's he's the one but I wouldn't trust Manchester United at all um Pedro if we knew Pedro was gonna start he could be a great option but I think we're gonna get mean how many times this season and I guess we need to bring up the Matrix here are we going to be discussing any other player AVN C and Harland I mean I know it's three weeks and they they've top scored and they've really delivered so that will change but you do start to wonder whether the bracket underneath when we're looking at you know the sacka son Bruno de bruyne foden that's the bracket underneath are they going to be able to make a step up because at the moment they haven't yet and and it's about what you talked about sacker earlier the ceiling versus Salah and harland's not the same is it I do hope they do push up but I just it's not happening yet is it we're gonna have those two weeks of Southampton and Leicester where sacka is going to be very very popular yeah um but other than that I think it's going to be Holland and sah but I mean if you're paying 15 million for Holland you kind of need to Captain him every week with the odd exception of a really tough game when someone's got a good one because yeah yeah like five and six okay but you're gonna if you've got harand you're going to Captain him between seven and 10 I imagine yeah there it is in The Matrix you look at that run seven and 10 it's full of at home walls away so home Bournemouth away I mean I really worry about not having him during that per um I can cover it with sacka for game week seven game week eight though where do I go you know where I mean will I will I still have son I don't think so so you know I you go Sal don't you home to Chelsea but yeah yeah yeah you do I mean Salah in a home fixture of course but then Salah goes to Arsenal when harland's at home to santon so I've got to where do I go there I'm not gonna have Watkins or Palmer am I so you know me saying I don't know when I'm gonna wild card I think I think I'm going to be faced with having to unless I've got some City cover then am I going to Captain Fen over Harland maybe but nine Nine's a Savage week nine is a Savage week for if you're going non Harland that is because that that's there's gonna be triple captains out on Harland again that week yeah and you can't go Salah at Arsenal and sacka own to Liverpool really can you I don't know could be a game of goals and you know you probably have to don't you you have to back goals and hope that that Salah will return I mean Watkins doesn't really deserve to be on this list does he at the moment but by then he could he could be more of a factor for us but you're definitely not captaining Watkins at the moment even with Everton at home and we were talking about it again last episode saying Watkins could be a captain opportun for us this week no chance uh let's look at Rob's data Rob T um robt fbl he puts out excellent Graphics like this based on spreadex betting odds and no question City's um 2.95 projected goals 46 percent chance um clean sheet versus Liverpool 2.8 projected goals those two right out in front with Brighton 2.40 yeah so those three teams are the ones expected to get the goals this week no surprise and like you said he does favor it does favor Harland over Salah here not only because the amount of goals projected but also the Monopoly that Harland has on City goals versus Salah yeah um so yes I think if you got both you go Harland if you haven't got Harland you've got a good bet in seller this this game week but that that's going to change as we get later in the season from game week seven onwards we've got a problem so we've got to address that and see what we do capy though I think is pretty cut and dry let's look at our teams in to round up on this is yours as talk us for it for the podcast this is mine so Henderson in goal with home game against Leicester I'm hopeful with some he can build his four points from last week uh it's Trent porro and Robinson in defense I'm happy with that obviously porro has got Arsenal but I'm backing them to win so then there's no way they're going to get a clean sheet but he is still taking up ridiculous positions um it's sacka jotta Gordon and Rogers which was a disappointing Midfield last week sacka is gonna go tonight I think for Salah um saca's very very close oh no sack's close to a price drop it doesn't actually affect me because he's already gone up one so I don't need to make a move tonight but it is probably gonna be sacka to S s's getting a price drop is he really yeah he's gone up to 106 now he's now he's dropping um I think so many people are making that move to to um and then har and Captain Mata who's been really disappointing since I bought him in obviously now has entia uh and and Pedro who who came in very early in the international break and Smith were on the bench so if Pedro does Miss out completely or if har misses out completely because there is some talk about um one of his friends has has sadly passed away he's been yeah they've said that he might be given um compassionate leave um for it which would you know really really rock the boat but he's been training today I don't think that's going to happen but want to monitor make sure your bench is is at least lined up correctly just in case I saw that in the chat and I thought well I better not highlight that comment because I've not heard that and that is like that's Furious speculation that we don't really want to throw in at this stage but yeah right he he has he has trained today though so I think it's unlikely I think he he missed um he missed a bit of time to to to go and kind of uh you know kind of not deal with it but you know yeah yeah yeah yeah deal with it himself um but he's he seems back but maybe he'll be given a bit of time it's unlikely fair enough um what do you expect then Green Arrow um I'm a bit worried about quite a few players josa Gordon Rogers mateta haven't really delivered for me yet this season um obviously Pedro might be benched poo concedes Henderson ConEd somehow much disaster is what you're yeah basically but I mean Mata has got Lester at home so it's not bad Pedro has got IP switch Rogers has got Everton so it could go completely the other way and I will have Sal and Harland so yeah I'm gonna predict about to finish the week about where I am 800 Kish yeah you'll take that right that' be right um this is me um Rya Lewis Trent coner Smith Rose son Salah Captain sacka Rogers isak and xal Pedro I am going to make a transfer and that transfer will be Smith row to E I have the money to do that yeah that's nice um and then the idea will be that I will probably roll next week and then go take true transfers into game week six and go sonto and bumo isach to havs is what I'm potentially looking at although looking at the captaincy coming up there might be grounds for keeping son because he could give me a route for the captaincy if I don't go Harland so I don't know I want in bumo for that run but I do have there so I have some cover of brenford for six this week how will I do like every week it will depend what Harland does so my fate is in his hands basically because I think Salah could EAS I think Salah will return I think Forest will lose I think they'll score two or three goals as I've said in my predictions I think I'll get something from sacka um I probably will get a clean sheet out of Lewis probably I could get a clean sheet from Trent but I do think we score coner could keep a clean she as well I think it's going to be an okay week but yeah if you don't have Holland it's down to that if he blanks you're going to get a green arrow if he scores you're going to get a gray or red it's it it's the way it's going at the moment if you can get both here that's the way to go it really depends on what my Supporting Cast does if if son E sacka Yeah isak in particular me isak could be a key player for me because if he's getting heavily sold then if he returns then he could be a Difference Maker so yeah it's interesting I mean these are scenarios that I'm glad we've got you know there's there's such Variety in the way teams are going and players who could have had that game week it's a it's a wider Pool isn't it than normal and but those Fringe players are so key because if you if you don't have a Palmer and he goes off or you don't have a sack or you don't have a har and you can't have them all obviously yeah you need your Fringe players your Rogers your Matas your Smith Rose whoever to chip in with some points to try and make up that deficit a bit and if you're on the wrong side of the premiums and your Supporting Cast aren't chipping in points you could you could have an absolute you know people can catch up 30 40 points on you really quickly this year there's going to be a lot of big swings for people this year and it's you're not going to get it right every every week but you just need to hope that you've got players in who can who can make up the difference yeah I mean I'm trying not to look at other people's teams and say I'm I'm basically going to logically get do the right move which I think is Smith Ro tza I like that and and then you know I've got to hope that one of son isak or saaka come in for me because if all three of them blank and Harland scores I'm getting red so I've got to get something from sonak and sacka I think one of they they're a good for yeah they they're good players um so I think one of those three will return and they're all going to be pretty significant differentials the way the market has gone because isak and sacka are leaving teams and son isn't in many teams so I think I'll be okay but it's it's the way it's every week I'm like that and I don't mind that I don't mind that I I want to rely on a a broader range of players rather than just the Heavy Hitters which was a lot of last season it was like well if Palmer and Salah and harand come in you're going to do well and and they were doing well every week so it's better it feels better and I mean I'm I'm so hyped about this season the way it's going so far I'm I'm not really concerned you know how well I'm doing I'm more concerned at the moment about the state of fbl and the way it is and it's getting me excited again about playing it which is a good thing which just four players the same this week team and at spells last year for the first time ever we had 11 players the same yeah and it felt horrible didn't it you were like 150 points ahead of me wasn't ideal yeah and you know we're we're more or less neck and neck so it it's I like it I like where we are I like where The Season's at I like the decisions we're having to make I like the dilemmas and you know the fact that people are selling eak and sacka and going I don't feel happy about it that's great that's what the D that's the kind of dilemmas we want playing this game right we don't want decisions to be easy we want to be punished at times and make us think twice that's what playing this game should be about um so we'll see we'll see I'm looking forward to the weekend um that's where we go apart from you've got two wild card teams to have a look at do you want to show them now we got over the two hours and might sck them up what's behind these then this is wild card one this is the Harland only team yeah I just thought I thought there's obviously a lot of people on on wild cards this week so I thought we could at least touch on on something so I just had to go putting together like I said I wrote the article just with a couple different ideas one I totally ignored yeah yeah yeah well until well only when you found out it was M me that's that's fine um but this is using plan FPL this was a while closing up because that's that's with ver bragen and flecken in goal with Trent Lewis and gayy um sber and Greaves on the bench so you've got s that comes in obviously for the great fiction gay week six it's actually son in to Target these two and then you'd look to switch him over to to sacka I prefer son for the next two weeks given I think Spurs are gonna win this game and then Sak um and then e Diaz and M and then Haren Captain I think I would still go for Watkins if I was on a wild card this week um although that's looking each day that passes and he's he's gonna start Everton isn't he unless he is injured yeah I think I would go for him but you could also move to isack and just just take the guaranteed start against against wolves I don't mind that either and then Pedro and then fleen Rogers sleep and Greaves on the bench I think this is a pretty strong team to World card into there's no real weakness there I don't think and you've got the double up on bright the triple up on Brighton for the next two as well the the AR Defender on the bench as well skews the strength of it a little bit and what you've got then I I guess you've done this to show the the um difference between the the teams with with Salo and harand so this is the Salo and harand team yeah and and I don't hate this um so this is Ray in goal with Trent Lewis and gayi so um same back three but Ray is in instead of the um the rotation because it's a bit cheaper to to do that because you haven't got to pay six million for for CBA um Saka e Salah M and Rogers um and then Harland and jel Pedro um up top and then the bench you've got to play you got have two four billion Defenders to have this so Stevens and Greaves are both starting I've managed to get DAP in there as like another option as as a kind of five5 you could put him down to a four five and strengthen the defense somewhere else give yourself a bit of a bench um I don't hate this I mean it's got Ry it's got Trent it's got sacka It's got Salah and Harland the issue is yeah the issue is is that you've got M Rogers and Pedro all under six million that you have to play every week and you can't really move away from them I look at this and go where are my transfers going to be a week you know unless I'm moving e out I'm not going to be touching Trent or Lewis if Lewis stays on the team I'm you know okay I could move four five Defender out in and out but that's that's a lot of fun isn't it so basically my my input into this team for a good period unless there's injuries will be which five five am I gonna move out this week it is do I bring in do I bring in I don't know if I want that game I mean this might well be the an optimal lineup is that a lineup I want to take on and and manage you know I I know okay is it about rank is it about the fun and engagement for me there's still an element of fun and engagement and I like you know the decisions we're making and we talk about it just now with the sacka and eak decisions these are tough decisions there are if they go wrong it's big swings those are the things I like I don't like going all should I go Min us a meno that's that's like doing weeks of that is GNA kill my enjoyment really if I get loads of points but I think it will I think you would look at around seven or eight to think about taking Salah out and redistributing your funds a little bit more um also the other problem with this is Lewis as well at 47 if he suddenly does get dropped you're then looking at Stevens and Greaves um coming in like a law firm doesn't it take Stevens and Greaves so you could you could do Lewis to to dunk or or to or to for defender or something to give you that certainty or maybe you do Stevens to vanderberg yeah it is a bombsite bench absolutely but I love that there's there's not really like I said unless you move the lap down to a four five and then you get in two four five Defenders um there's not there's not really a lot of movement movement here um in the chat trigger's in the chat that's not trigger lips is it talk FBA that I think it could be I think it could yeah um so yeah we welcome we're getting going very well at the moment um well I take it from the the badge that's him as well isn't it with the uh the Aussie reference I know maybe it's not could be and one comment I did want to I starred earlier that I thought was fantastic from Greg fost just in case you're settled on that sacka transfer look at that sacka scored 28 points against Spurs last season the most against any opponent there we go let's let's throw that one in there just to make you feel a little bit worried a bit more about selling fake news fake news fake well done Greg love that propaganda keep that coming um right should we uh should we hit some of the uh should we hit some of the super chats because we might keep going into the night we might be able to hit midnight if we keep going I'm so tired I'm just Delirious so yeah we might as well uh yeah should I should i r through these yeah stick a few on this is from flanny boy 1888 I am wild carding without Harland Team Rated at 95% in FPL planner with be in it and point three in the blank question is should I go for a cheaper City mid and if so so I can get to Harland in week seven still bra not going with him now but obviously wanting to think about how to bring him in a bit later if you didn't wild card harand now would you get him in seven or would you just try and ride it out by way thank you for the very generous Super Chat for yeah I I just don't see the logic in not wild carding him in now um is it because you feel the team will be stronger without him for this period maybe maybe you could create a team stronger without him for this period I'd like to see what it is you mean obviously it's 95% in in Ai and who am I to question the AI but you know um I'm convinced the AI is just slippers answering instant messages by the way every time takes a screenshot or sends it enough one to go yeah send that he's building it he's he's he's the brains behind it absolutely boring there's no computer at work it's just it's just Andy in the slippers um H got I I mean I think we looked at the capy Matrix right and we looked at that run and and you know we'll bring it up again now um if you haven't got Harlem from seven to 10 where are you going with the captaincy yes you've got sacker and seven fine game week eight you've got a problem game week nine you've got a big problem so I think that's what I would fear I think you've GNA if you're not going to Wild Card Harland in now yes you've got to get him in in May certainly by eight um so so if I go for a cheaper City mid I guess it has to be kdb at the moment because foden's not there um some genius about greish earlier maybe that's it there isn't a cheaper City mid is there um I mean rogery is is like six million or 65 but you are Delirious yeah you need not well my point is you're not going to go there so you're getting de bruyne to cover harand essentially I think you you just ride that if if you if you think there's not going to be much in it between them which I don't agree with but if you're going without him now I think you just accept that you're probably not G have him yeah so the same logic applies if you think that harland's not necessary now why do you need him seven I guess that's exactly I would argue you go harand now and then you wait for foden and see what happens and then if you need to move off Harland to spread funds you've got a foden to go to I would rather go to a foden than the kdb myself I would not be War carding about Holland now no nor would I no so that's that's hopefully we've earn at 10 pounds I feel like we have get in touch and we'll pay it back to youny do don't do any of the things that you're you're suggesting copy said David James says I bloody love these pods up the borrow yeah mid the midd fan yeah I don't mind midd they getting on this season W first I haven't looked actually I I I it's criminal actually because I don't look at the championship now long gone it's long on but um yeah I um I don't mind bar and is Carrick still there I think he is isn't should season last b b are seventh okay that's all right the championship is so groeling I mean I don't never want to go back there it's such a hard League really all don't miss it at all uh this is from Jordan nayed hi guys bench one of Gabrielle porro or Lewis Can't bench Lewis no it's it's um porro I would pces porro from open Play I would bench porro i' bench Gabrielle we say it because we're in pain because it's a very difficult decision there not much in it is there I I think there's only one team keeping the clean sheet if there's going to be a clean sheet and that's that's Arsenal um and so you're down to How likely is porro to to get an attack in return and you know he's up against a good defense so cor gab yeah I yeah but then Gabrielle's on Corners in a different I'll go Gabrielle myself over but difference of opinion that's fair enough yeah uh this is from ay thank you for Super Chat do you start Smith row at home to West Ham or Rogers at home to Everton Rogers yeah I'm benching Smith row currently for Rogers so we're on that front I I mean Smith row is not getting the full 90 yet is he still not so it's just expected minutes and um that's a factor plus you know Rogers could be on pens I we joke about it but he could well be um so and I think you know Everton have conceded three goals in every game so far so Everton is if if you're 5050 Everton is the team to Target at the moment at the moment yeah at the moment uh and then finally from Davy's family first um have Trent Robinson Johnson and Barco oh God sorry get the blame for that there's going to be teams of Barco in right to gameweek 38 gut punch you every week basically he's he's got a drop so you know would you do Hall to Pal Torres or wood to Pedro or Rea to Martinez and Hall to Lewis trying to remain in the Clouds of overall rank 13 well done David Family First well done sounds all right don't hate that yeah yeah R wood to Pedro is interesting given my theory about would not start in but I've got the certainly wouldn't get rid of ryer um halter Lewis I would do halter Lewis you can't you can't do halter Lewis yes you can no save some money oh I see I wouldn't do that then right yeah so it's the first one Hal to Pal to pal I think that's just a you're not going to regret that are you although would to would to Pedro that's a good long-term move it depends when you're when you're wild carding if if if you're wild carding in six I think wood to Welbeck wood to Welbeck oh you put well back in there if you're wning in six I'm gonna say Hall toal just so I can say toow used to be one of my favorite bands that's what you get you that's what you pay for with these super chats great advice I'm basing it solely on the fact I used to fancy Carol DEA Hal to Pal m m just text me and said that he just met car vman at the pub oh what a coincidence I've just mentioned a Carol now another famous Carol has come up reminded me where's he met her at this time of night a pub okay I I guess Cal V was allowed to go to a pub did he say I it might be a book signing I think she might have a new book out and she's doing a book signing at the signing books at a pub right okay celebrities these days I don't know yeah she is he just sent me a picture of of her with a a weird picture is itman like a book but on like a still there or if they haven't left who's your favorite Carol mine's Carol Deco every day it's not Carol vman so who's your favorite Carol stick that in chat is that car that was good I should have been too sharp for this time night is it midnight yet not quite we've got 14 minutes to go we're not going to get to midnight thank you very much for the super chats and thank you for everyone who joined us tonight the all that talk of toal has sent the audience down to 1400 but we hit we hit, 1600 at his Peak which is marvelous for a late night stream sorry we were late tonight but if you joined at the start you will know I went through trauma before the start of the stream never want to do that again you were I've seen you worse have you please you weren't great but you weren't you wer meltdown which is that's all right that's okay that's all right yeah fine yeah anyway enough of my stress another another box is done and I really enjoyed that we did two hours 19 minutes FB is back as and I'm pleased about it when's the next International break oh no it's four week it does kill momentum doesn't it this first one's a real problem because it kills momentum but even now I'm looking we've only got four weeks and we got another one they shouldn't have one this early no got change it it's misery for FB managers and content creators but we're back and we're pleased about it thank you very much for your support hit subscribe if you're new around here and hit the like if you enjoyed this stuff there you go very good uh is a good night for me good night everyone oh I've lost my credits there they are good night again [Music] [Music]",27897,good evening everyone for anyone saying the sponsors of blackbox pay us too much money have never had to sit with mark s for 35 minutes while he sorts his camera out thats all im saying my god like people say whats your superpower i think my superpower is i can take any trivial thing and make it stressful four years youve been doing this every week honestly my word right im okay i had to go and have a wii sorry as well right at the end just as we were going to go live on night im gonna have to go now was i was just are you joking but the good thing is a six minute credits mean everyone got to see like the full intro words on the screen there some people won have seen them all so amazing i hope our sound is okay because we havent had time to sound check but i think its all good that we sound good loud and clear says derek nos hello derek thank you for joining us n the karbers sals is camera out is quite the you no honestly it was nigel did you win b mark on the toilet this time i no i went in i used porcelain for sure no one will know what youre talking about there is definitely context needed but im not even gonna say it so no theres 783 watching i think the more technical issues we have the greater the audience way its always been way sorry were 35 minutes late and two hours later than the normal time of 7 were here its fun you got beer as well we are ive got a beer weve got lots to talk about guns out is the title of the show because everyone selling sacker odard injury dean rice is out theres definitely a tide a tial wave of people moving off their arsenal assets and i think im sharing the airways with one here arent i as you doing you are indeed and im im seeing the moves im planning loads of people are making those moves now some people making them for hits i dont feel good about them at all so im surprised so many people are thinking about sacker and isach out im im nervous about it ive already made one of the two moves so no going back now how it goes right in fbl one of the unwritten rules is when a large section of the community go with a particular opinion and that opinion could be a slid ind doors crosss whatever it is what happens next right normally it normally blows up in our face doesnt it any mass decision like this thats gone well i no exactly very rarely does it go called into plan which its disconcerting for me because im going to end up cing sellah so if people who are selling sacka getting sah and that doesnt work out then its still gonna hurt me because im probably end up captain so therell be some pain this side as if it does go wrong flanny boy 1888 thank you so much for the super chat already we will get to super chats at the end well probably be here till 10 to midnight or even later than that but thats all good we do it thats the thing we do right lets lets get on with some stuff shall we but before we do we better have a word from our sponsors and my word we earn those sponsors yes yes well everyone by now will be familiar with sleeper i think a lot of content creators talking about it a lot of people getting involved in the in the pickham league and we had our first winner from that and a playstation 5 well be going to our monthly winner of the of the pickham league me and you mark or you and i should say took part in our first ever blackbox draft it was fun it good i loved it it was like it revived memories of the old days i we were running the team together there was a little bit of two and thr between us you were nay saying my picks but i think in the end we got a team of 15 seven of which are all injured or suspended our team is palmer salanki diaz kuna rea romero aangi and bailey then it starts getting a little bit suspect with rice caori such anderson kadogo cliver honana and alex moreno but everyones in the same boat the first eight or nine picks were fine and then it was a bit it got a bit ropey after that i think were in a pretty good pretty good position against the others i think so once we get k galo play in and califur i cant why have we got why have we got these players i cant pronounce you idiot once we get them back from injury any players it would have limited us we were that was our policy thats absolutely true so im gonna love doing that and im looking forward to it looking forward and the sleeper app was good the interface was good it didnt crash no issues very smooth experience so get involved get involved if you fancy having a that is the message get involved try out the draft use the qr code on the screen give that a scan just give it go let us know what you think of it i thought it was a great i thought it was a great interface and the draft was fun and anyone asking where they can watch it there are im hoping theres going to be more clips like the ones they posted coming soon so if not well publish the whole thing arguments and the bit the bit when gi kept signing injured players and we were like it would you say hes gonna need a good physio like that no i said hes goingon to need jesus christ as a physio to revive them from the dead bailey is injured i know david yes bailey is injured we have picked some injured players as well but we havent got reese james how have we got on and alex moreno all right that be fine right fbl lets get on to that sh we lets look at our game weeks first of all shall we you did all right 73 got some points from henderson finally four points for him trent porro and robinson another assist from robinson hes hes done right in the first in the first few weeks pretty happy that for four five jotter gordon and rogers that was all a bit of a disaster one assist from sacka nothing from the other three attackers despite all all scoring goals nothing from jot is disappointing when des got the brace and salah got what 17p pointer so that was that was annoying harand and isach harand with a hattick captain carrying the team as usual isach with the goal hes been unceremoniously shipped out after his after his first goal of the season and beta whos blanked twice since i bought him in now has massive threat from other signings theyve made and im a bit worried about him and nothing much on the bench it was an okay week but like one player scoring over 10 and that was harlands captain the rest is pretty average what you make it j because we had high expectations when we learn hed start the season down the middle but diaz has been the one of the of the two s5s to come out and hit with big points so far j the right week one but i dont know he does seem to be dropping deeper and letting salah and diaz be the ones that tuck in is that your impression next year i have 08 in that man utd game which isnt ideal but 099 and 065 in the games before and had a goal and assist in though so going into the game against manchest united i was pretty conf he was going to get something and when the score goes to 30 you think hes going to be involved in some capacity but i think its just going to be one of those is i think salahs just going to consistently score points and then the other i put sabosa into that bracket as well probably not as high as diaz and j but i think theyre all just going to have weeks where they score well score weeks where they dont and you can keep trying to chase it and getting diaz but i think you just pick one and stick with them and until jot loses his places ill be ill be sticking with him people requesting to see how ranks ill get i there we go theyre under our names there and while theyre fairly decent well keep them head with noland well more than that in a minute lets get to my team and go through that no harland of course it was ryer two points lewis six trent six coner two smith ow2 son just the three sacka captain which was a big disappoint that in a minute salah 17 rogers two isach nine and wiissa who was my transfer coming in with goal and bonus 69 not great didnt have harland captain the wrong player and i will point out the fact that ive captain in salah only once and got a double figure return in match of the day game week two of captain e gw one and sacka game week three what have they got in common theyre both playing teams at a man sent off so on both occasions when i picked the captain other than salah the teams ive captained a player in have been reduced to 10 men with rightfully 45 minutes to go rightfully sent off come on dear me it was its frustrating because i think saaka sh still should have got more points because he had a chance right at the end and he was heavily involved was he had hint you on toes didnt he in the first 15 20 minutes it was very concerning and then we started to play a bit better for i dont know it was a it was a evish game but arsenal will feel like they should have won that especially towards the end like you say i thought i thought that was in i thought saka was just going to bury that and it was gonna break some hearts great result for brighton arsenal should have won it but brighton good account of themselves again and i was disappointed with son because i did think spurs would get something at newcastle and they played well did okay but newcastle grounded out the result didnt they and spurs again liking game week one at leicester away from home just couldnt convert their play into chances and goals and some hanging on this week i dont know whether hell go it doesnt look like it looks like im going to make another change but more on that at the end but wha was great hoped for turn got one now hes going to be on my bench for a few game weeks until brenford run starts in game week six onwards and thats where hopefully hell come into his own but ive noticed a lot of content creators talking about him now so good to get to him early the original the original and of course we know how it works because i got him first no one else is allowed to have him thats thats exactly the way it works right should want him its like last season so once you get some points from him hes dead to me im never im never getting this now ever good brilliant thats thats thats fine lets look at great and the good and see where we stand in that lets go this is why we have to drink the cams harrys gone top of that harry how does he doing its crazy isnt it because i think hes got salah and harand right like prazz so salah and harand teams have done very well at the start of the season and perhaps the shortcomings of going salah and harland dont reveal themselves over a short spell its going to take longer so thats thats my reasoning as to why i havent got sal but salah pra and harry have done started the season well n 1996 or 196000 for harry pr 2016 216000 rather general just behind them and then fran 584 just above me lukes in between weve got a we got a disabled sandwich between between us as luke is between us disabled just to make that clear he his he his online name good clarification yes and then andy coming up behind you so to speak its all very close all very close i would just say harry hasnt got salah hes hes harland was he not no he is he is harland only he has got the mighty chriswood though which explain will be will be happy with his nine points and e kept to favor of e as well which again just shows patience with players good line numbers eventually theyll theyll come good so its nice were were were not in the bottom the were not in the trenches at the moment both in the top million ill take that qualifying for europe at the moment in the great the good which is fine well keep going on that lets look at start looking at some data then team defense so this is caveat fre game weeks small sample etc were looking for trends were looking for trends that could continue one thing thats unlikely to continue id imagine is noton forest being the second best defense in the premier league but there they are at the top but of course as you see fixture difficulties they had theyve had the best start to the season with their first three fixtures city at the top low and seven chances per 90 conceded the best of any team here and whats interesting is one we expect city to stay in the top two the second point thats interesting is arsenal who have kept three clean sheets and well two clean sheets and were keeping one until brighton scored and they reduced to 10 men down in seventh we have thought arsenal would be in the top two or three defenses but theyre not and theyre conceded in 14 chances per 90 which is quite a lot considering their reputation going into the season as the strongest defense well its not a broken record but they were lucky to not concede to cabia in gw one and they were i dont even what youd call it how they didnt concede toy watkins in game week two and like i said they were in they were in good control of that game limiting brighton to a few chances the red card changed things we had a good spell when just after that red card which its quite natural and then they started coming towards the end but luckily we managed to score in that in that spell where we were dominating a bit more but its its were going to be talking about the ramifications of odard being out havs having to drop back into midfield theyve got lots of defensive options timber came in but califur is he got a knock or is he pushing he got knock an international break i thought so but that doesnt change the makeup of it are they going to adopt a more defensive approach now theyve lost because theyve lost odard and theyve lost their main striker because hav is gonna have to drop back to midfield you see hav dropping back and well no jeesus could return so well need to get our teta team news but the last we heard about jezus is following the international break he might have a chance so he could be back in the frame you see it then as tral out front hav dropping back do you to take od guards plays in midfield probably because who do they bring into midfield if they keep habits up top do they bring two stoppers wouldnt they its part still there he started the season so if they bring him in then thats good news for the defensive but not so good news for zaka presumably mourinhos still out isnt he so they cant they cant bring him in i dont know i think its its one of the reasons its been an up and down international game with the transfers ive been looking to make debating whether to take sacker out or not now ive landed on sacker out and i think this news pushes me into that because i dont think its going to affect their defense but if youve got reyya ca gabrielle youre probably not expecting a clean sheet in the next two games against spurs and city anyway but it has to ive in my predictions ive said that spurs will score i agree with you i think that i dont i dont think in o odard were going to look up ive got some charts and tables on odard later on in the show that well get to i me look at midfielders but i dont think it changes arsenals approach to the game in that they are i think by their very nature defensively sound in every game they go into i dont think they go into any game going all out attack they are first and foremost resolute and then theyve got quality up top to score goals but theyre not going to win games 5 six nil theyve become almost what city have become which is a side that can get results but never takes the handbreak off and manages games out thats what theyve become its a results machine and its no surprise that artet has followed the same path that peps done with city in that respect of the teams at the top that are full on attack youd have to say it was liverpool under clop whether it is liverpool under slot so far youd say yes theyre the team who will go full thr and score goals but that could be changing as well liverpool are third in this table defensively and i dont think its a long stretch even after three games to say that were seeing liverpool change and theyre now a team that are more pragmatic and defensive do you do you feel that theres not many managers is there that have come in and kept free clean sheets in the first in the first three games im ive been impressive ive rewatched the highlights of the liverpool man utd game and theyre just leagues apart in terms of organization everything its going to be its gonna be interesting know what slot does with trent because there are some rumors going around arent there that hes not totally happy with him theres always been question marks around his defensive ability well if slot wants to turn liverpool into a more pragmatic and defensive unit what does that mean for trent because you could argue that hes a bit of a liability defensively but makes up for it with attacking play but i dont think i dont think liverpool are getting turned into a defensive side ill take that back but its more about control its and which is what city and arsenal are about its about controlling the game managing the game and the result being primarily the goal rather than were going to go all out and play like the heavy metal football that klopp used to play i think were seeing the dial move back some notches from that theyre still scoring goals but what we are seeing is suddenly rather than just being arsenal were the only team we can invest in defense for defense suddenly city are reviving it seems maybe its too early to say but maybe city are going to be that strong defensive unit again that we can go to who knows who we end up picking viio or lewis probably but liverpool are now in that bracket as well so far it would say and there are ways that we can tap into it with potentially allison robertsons popular over the break as well ive noticed theres a lot of ai recommendations for robertson going in the difficulty with that is you have to then sacrifice potentially going for assuming trent and salah are in your side youre having to choose between a diaz jota or a or a robertson and i still favor the attack i think with the fixures the way they are but robertson has presented himself as a as an interesting option going forward but its and the other and the other interesting thing is whats going with coner and canate like is canate just starting every week now because then hes an option as well i dont want to get into that because people are buy c conon their drugs and blame me for that but i think when europe starts we know game week four onwards thats going to answer some questions isnt it on that front just wanted to mention and villa defenses here they are fourth and fifth in the table the table is sorted by xg conceded non penalty per 90 and weve got city top 068 forest second 070 then liverpool 079 bit of a gap to villa on 10 and then chelsea 109 i mentioned villa and chelsea because in terms of fixture difficulty theyve had a tougher start in the top three so therefore perhaps and again early days perhaps villa and chelsea could turn into sides that we can look at i think probably in that second tier below city liverpool and arsenal but perhaps villa and chelsea could be the teams we go to for some value in defense the difficulty with vill the champions league is going to start and how theyre going to deal with that with all the games that theyve got to play coner is popular youve got him not k quansa the other one the k coner but people saw the hard part of that and the reason why he got less than 100 points last season despite playing most of the game is just villa concede stupid goals and concede goals and even though the stats are the underlying stats are good i still dont trust them in that area you lose that attacking threat that you get with someone like robinson for example at four five but the fixtures are nice so you are going to want to play him i just id still favor coner to like co will though at four or five i trust chelsea even less the teams just seem to be able to get at them and im surprised to see them at fifth on list they seem to get carved open quite easily but the underlying stats arent supporting that no 1067 chance hes considered p90 the same as villa so far we havent seen that middle in defense emerge were still waiting to see who it is and when were going to get to defenders we can see we know theres value with robinson at fulham and porro at spurs or maybe romero at spurs whats interesting here wolves are 132 with some tough fixtures they might be worth look and theres a name i want to pick out when we get to defenders who could be a target when the fixtures improve brighton middle in defense at the moment in 10th do you expect them to climb that table because i see you as a more defensive side since the zerby left right theres theres more of a plan i think to deal with theres a plan b when things arent going well to drop back and again i think weve got players who have already bought into the system and there seems to be like quite a lot of cohesion in the way we attack and the way we defend the issue is a little bit that dunc is getting on a bit kadogo is going to come in untested in the in the premier league hes got a great reputation people seem to absolutely love him but hasnt played in the premier league yet weve got hinwood playing a left back his stan should come back but hes been a bit suspect defensively i dont know theres theres a bit of like change and a bit of amendments coming to the brighton backline so would i expect immediate improvements on this probably not but i think it will settle down and we will become good value i think the ver bren and like fleen rotation if youre on a wild card just looks so good i was gonna the end of the season lets get to keepers save that chat till keepers es ban mentioning con got not playing fing he did indeed and he went off i think on about 70 minutes didnt look too serious he wasnt going off shaking his head or head in his hands or anything like that so we do have to wait for the presser for memory so we have to see we have to see whether coner is going to be ready for the weekend but you mentioned the fixtures lets just bring up the fixtures for villa this is the long ticker showing game weeks 4 to 12 and villa are four in that but if we look at the shortterm pictures everton at home wolves at home its swit away doesnt get much better than that does it doesnt but at the same time everton were impressive against bournemouth for 88 minutes jack harrison was looking good cal l had a bit about him they were attacking well and to lose that game is one of the biggest like throwaways i can i can remember because i was watching it a match of today and honestly bournemouth didnt have a highlight until 88th minute there wasnt a single attack of not for bournemouth and then there was like six highlights in a row all bournemouth attacks every cross seemed to cause them problems it was absolute capitulation wasnt it compl complete i watched some everton fan pods afterwards cuz i wallowing in other teams misy and they were just saying you could smell it you could smell it in the ground and like the fear in the players the minute they got one goal and its like ive been there with forest ive seen it i remember the sheffield united semi f in the playoffs when they pulled one back and suddenly you could just sense that all the confidence was going it was only a matter of time for more goals to consider and thats how it was in that game five minutes was crazy it was such an undy like end to the match because the balls were coming in and there was players unmarked on the edge of the area like everton had a breakaway and they tried to attack and then bournemouth won the ball back and pushed and everton werent bringing all their men back like hurridly to defend it wasnt like they were defending with 10 men behind the ball there was like massive pockets of space for bournemouth to attack d must have been i was gonna say tearing his hair out he has got much of that but he must its worrying he worrying whats going on at ev thats for sure lets look at some attacking data and some ofam i just going to say quickly theres theres that game and then its wolves and ip switch and although i think those games look amazing from an attacking perspective and youd expect them to score lots of goals i still think from a defensive perspective everton wolves nips switch isnt as easy as it as it might look on paper not when were talking about derby factor and then the nip switch i think are g to get him because i think whats his name up top dap i can never remember daps name dap up top is going to cause them isses lively and in it switch i think of all the promoted sides are the ones that are going to pose the biggest attacking threat we havent seen it yet which brings me to the attacking date we havent seen it yet and it switch bottom of this table for team dat attack xg non penalty per 90 40 the reason why theyre down there though is because theyve had the toughest opening three fixtures i believe i do believe that we will see more from them but having said that 633 shots per 90 is woeful but the fixtures have been against them so i am interested to see what they do now that the fixtures ease up for them somewhat but no surprise to see it switch and leester down the bottom s anonin 14th 116 more favorable but i think of the three promoter sides its which the one im looking at theyve signed some smart players i think and i think theyve got leaf davis someone who i said leaf there a player that could offer an option in defense in terms of attacking returns and i think theyve got a sprinkling of talent including dap like you mentioned so i expect to see halfway line drove and just banged it in great goal not what youd expect from a promoted striker but he was he was in the championship last season on loan part of the city graduates so you expect him to be quality and hes starting to show it but i think its which will climb this table i dont think theyll climb to the heights and at the very top we see liverpool there who are absolutely dominant what the stat that i pick out here although its 237 non penalty per 90 its the big chances over five big chances per game crazy that that is massive and were expecting that to plateau a little bit but the next two fixtures are good two home games forest with good underlying numbers but youd still expect liverpool to to have chances in that game and then bournemouth at home when harlands away and i think thats what taking me into the realms of thinking i want to get salah in because that bournemouth at home game looks great when harlands got that tricky match and then its who do you captain otherwise because if ive just got harland and sacka as my two premiums i dont want to captain either of them in that match so then im either taking a punt on someone else in five but theres no one i trust at the moment or i go for go for sell what were talking about is the liverpool bank of pies which starts now which is a group of four fixtures which we always wanted to target forest bournemouth wolves away and then palace away and the reason why thats of interest is because in the middle of that harland plays arsenal and then goes to newcastle and newcastle away traditionally one of the hardest away games and he might find it difficult there i me all at the moment hes not finding anything too difficult but you got to say if youre comparing harand to c over this next four you would say that salahs got a good chance of outscoring harand right given that hes kept pace of himself so far they got theyve got identical points at the moment 41 points that is that is that is ridiculous i wasnt expecting that the main reason why i didnt go with him i thought i thought the points might be shared a bit more between liverpool and it turns out they were just all getting them except for bloody j apparently trent how trent hasnt got an attack in return yet i dont know because that offside was salah didnt need to touch that did he and then and then trents getting a double digit in that he could have had an assist in the first game lot of what ifs and maybees but i think hes been genuinely unlucky not to not to come away with more points but you look at this st and think with two home games to come and then wolves and then palace that isnt exactly a bad game the way palace have started you want to be trebling up i think on liverpool in some capacity i think we i mentioned that liverpool becoming maybe more pragmatic under slot but its not detracting from their attack and data its been the perfect start three wins no goal was conceded slot looks confident and we maybe questioned some of his methods in handling man management maybe with trent in particular but theres no theres no question hes getting results and liverpool are that fb points machine we needed them to be with harand so dominant it would have been a pretty tedious start to the season if salah haden have kept pace as he has because then we wouldnt be sitting here even deba whether we go harand because he would be absolutely dominating but the fact that salah with a liverpool team that looks like theyre going to be scoring goals regularly sal is a viable option which is what we need and now we need other players to join that we need we need son to step up when he sacker to step up to rival holland otherwise we just dont want that one player dominating things do we im still im still i did an article for sports casting which you can you can see on my twitter which was i was looking if i was going to wild card this week what route would i go down would i go salah only well no cuz i want i dont think ill be wild carding out harland right now would i go harland only or would i go for both and even though im thinking of getting both in my team this week doing that sacker and esack move i dont like the idea of wild carding and having both just because when you look at what it does to the rest of your side youre stuck having to play three five fives every week and okay those five fives are under arent bad because im looking like min rogers and j pedro for example theyre not a bad three but youre locked in to them so what happens if like a saos light emerges and you want to move and you need to find an extra million from somewhere or you want to get robertson or arsenals fixes turns soon you want to get an arsenal defender you want to get sacker its it becomes very inflexible and things change very quickly in the next few weeks so i think i would still go for just harland if i was walk carding this week and its what put me off doing it in this in this pr bas its funny you changed your your profile image on twitter and its thrown me completely because i saw this article on twitter saying do you want to go sal and harand i thought well thats handy ill have a read of that and then i realized it was written by you and i was i havent read it youre about to pay me thats the best no dont dont think there was a compliment coming because i think i think the biggest thing for me when i look at teams that are and this is one of the big topics at the moment is about you forgoing sacka to bring in salah is its the fact that arsenals fixtures although theyre tough over the spell were looking at here from 4 to 12 theyre like third from bottom on the ticker theyve got spurs and city next and thats whats dragging it down but theres also a bad run from gw nine 10 and 11 when they face liverpool at home newcastle away chelsea away now thats a tough run but in between that sandwiched in between that is in game week six leicester at home and in game week seven s an at home those are probably the two best home fixtures you can have and they get them back to back and even without odard there if he isnt back by then youd still back arsenal to score goals get clean sheets and so if youre moving away from arsenal in order to get money for sa for salah youve got that problem of gw six and seven havent you well i think it pretty much locks me into a wild card in six right doing these moves which i dont think is the worst thing in the world because i want to be able to take advantage of that fixure anyway and probably double up triple up on arsenal over that time but i cant be going into at the moment ive got no arsal defender and i probably well i wont have sacker if i take him out for salah so how am i going to move back to those for six im not going to be able to so i think thats thats going to be a wild card in six for me if and when i go ahead with it because im im going to go ahead with it i think i without an arsenal defender i can absolutely see why doing it because youre you not only are you not going to have sacker youve got to get an aral defender as well for that for that run i get it i think if you did have an arsal defender though if you were in that situation would you be thinking twice about selling sacka because you you are committing the wild card arent you if its just one transfer you could in theory do salah back to sacka and would you do that though when salahs salahs going to wolves and palace wolvves w thats it youre going to be selling sal is away at wolves if i wild card though its probably going to be the same boat because like i said im probably not going to go with harand and salah so then i getting rid of salah away at away at wolves and hes hes cap hes probably the best captain option that week isnt he because like you said harlands got newcastle away so maybe its a case of holding off until seven to walk c sell out when he plays palace away which its still a pretty good fixture but its not as you can catch in saaka surely are you not going to do that youre not going to catch inaka to leicester maybe i dont trust zaka as a captain youre not dont know well you you captained him and got six points his ceiling does feel like its lower than harand for sure i get that but hes a consistent points machine like i have no doubt he will get returns in those two games whether hell get double figures thats the big issue isnt it youd expect him to get at least one if he doesnt get one double digit hall against leester and southampton at home like you said theres two best fixtures you can have its going to be interesting period that because youre going to want all three of those players and you can do it but like i said youre youre youre going to be massively low in other areas of your of your team so youre not thinking of wild card into that scenario i will im not ruling it out but would i wild card into salah har and sacka and trent and then have to with all the all the low all the other dr that im going to have to have in my side thats not even take into account palmer for example whos got brighton at home in six and then forest at home in seven two home games for him hes incredible at home last season its a its a real dilemma it is and i think were sitting here in game week three or four and its like are we confident enough that we know the where the value is like we can get to midfielders in a bit and we look at min seeno there are players there that you think well they can at a 55 fulfill the role of enablers to get me to a place where i could get those big hitters in but were only three game weeks in and so like you say someone could yet emerge as a major bandwagon that we want to move to and then youre youre cut off from making that without making multiple transfers so it is it is early well the other option is you dont go for sack and you go for have up top and if youve got isack for example well isack in six has got man city so that feels like a good time to he then immediately goes into everton off the back of that but maybe thats if you cant move for sack because you dont want to lose your c and harland maybe thats the way you attack those two because up to now havs has been outscoring sea so might not happen carry on happening but at the moment you could back you could have a go but not having sacker for leicester and southampton at home is a worry youre going to be especially after what i saw against brian because like you said he could have hold in that he just sometimes finds a way not to get all the points that he deserves but what i will say is were gonna touch on the impact that od guards absence could have on arsenal and sacka later in the show and maybe thats a factor havitz has been playing up front and hes not you dont think hes going to be with odard out its whether or not odard is back for gw six and seven which he could be and we just weve yet to hear the length of the injury were thinking three weeks could be a month right thats what thats what the talk is but not been confirmed as yet well get on to that in a bit lets look at goalkeepers low so i was going to ask you about for buan because were waiting for four or five option to stand out because at the moment the heavy hit of goalkeepers and say that mildy because theyre five5 so its not a big outlay at the moment its still allison and ryer out on top and it looks like if you went and spent the money thats been well spent at the moment but were braced for a four five to break through and when they do that could be where you save and when people wild card in six maybe by then theres enough confidence in a four five to move there it could be fleen with great fixtures for brenford for example but youve also mentioned for buen and youve also mentioned the rotation between the two of them put my neck on the line a little bit last time we one of these when i said the br was going to reclaim that spot from still i didnt expecting him to get a bloody low move but luckily he came straight back into the side i do like for bren i like him as a goalkeeper i like i said i do think brightons defense in the medium to long term will improve the trouble is you want him for the next two because thats when we got two good home fixtures and im not sure what happens in those i think we should keep at least one clean sheet across those but i wouldnt be too surprised if we conceded in both but if you if you go over to the fixtures quickly ver bren and fleen have got just an unbelievable rotation you would bring in ver bran playing this week for i switch and forest and then youd play fleen for west ham and wolves you can also then play him in man utd as well which is an awful brighton got newcastle away and they always find a way to beat us so id probably stick with fleen in that one but then you play for bren with wolves at home and then you move back to fleen and you have full bournemouth and everton so the toughest fixture from now right up until gw 12 is that decision between man utd or newcastle the rest is as good as it gets i think the only thing with that is if youre planning on doing it a bit later you dont need for bren because you can just keep fleen so im im seeing teams wild carded with just fleen f the next two are rough and youre probably not going to get clean sheet either of those but then from then youve saved the0 five and you can just play flicking across the board but if i was doing it right now i think id go with both id counter it as well by saying youre spending 9m on a keeper there youre getting two four fs and you can get for nine five for an extra not five you could get ry or allison right so its like the degrees of savings youre getting then goes down and then youve always got to get the rotation right whereas you can just stick ry and allison in and then forget about it so its whether that not five is going to be worth it and it im im a big advocate of saving money and team value so theres no question it could be at some point i think at the moment again its its too early for us to know which is the best route to go but flecken from six looks very good and he will be the goto for wild cards at that point theres no question just because of the fixtures but also 17 saves made so far he hasnt kept the clean sheet theyve conceded four goals in three games which isnt terrible but 17 saves is by far in away the most saves on show here so flein is what we knew he was some someone who makes saves a lot of saves in a game as a result any bonus yet because whats interesting is no keepers kept no keepers got any bonus without keeping a clean sheet as yet which is what we expected because of the anywh near nowhere near no so youre not fleen might get you save points but dont expect that to be coupled with a bonus point here and there because it doesnt look like its going to happen this season and the flip side of that is that ray has been fortunate in that they have conceded shots hes made 10 saves and in the two clean sheets that hes kept hes got an average of two bonus points so youve got to keep clean sheets to get bonus as a keeper it seems the boat its still cheaper to go with the two four fs than go for ray and a four so youre still saving a bit of money there and you then pair it with a gabrielle or a cba to cover the arsenal defense and you could bench them for the next two if you dont think theyre going to keep if you think theyre going to concede and then bring them in i think allisons at still a nogo though because i still think you want to keep that third liverpool spot available so its ray its ray or well its ray the rotation or just flecken i think theyre your three options i wouldnt be going near anyone else and i think were going to see the movement towards fleen but i dont im not going to sell rare i dont think maybe i might do on the wild card depending on when that comes out but at the moment im going to hold tight and see if a 4 five a strong four five does a m so its questionable whether brenford ed those fixtures it is an incredible run though and so fleen id expect fleen to emerge but well see well see how it turns out pford miserable 24th look at that its just been 10 goals conceded he has made nine saves so he could yet be a four well he could yet be i was goingon to say 4 five hes not he was five million which he stacked against him hes gone down to 49 as a result of the start hes had dont see him being a factor in our season at all grog day isnt it from last season exactly what we said last year they conceded loads of goals in the first few weeks he looked absolutely dreadful people wild carded him out got rid of him and then d got them playing and turn turned around but they theres nothing positive the only thing positive about evon was that they should have been outside they honestly should have been five nil up i think in that game against bournemouth i thought they were brilliant particularly in the first half but then pf pford made a mistake hes i think that might even be the second one hes hes been hes because it was against spurs wasnt it he did the clanger for son just took off his t knocked him another one in this and when youve got one of your star players doing that youve you just ask him for trouble so they need to massively turn it around but i just dont see it for now d has either got well it will turn i d would be gone because he cant keep losing games by this margin so hes got a turn for them i me well see maybe pitford can do what he did last season it should help us yes absolutely hes a key player isnt he defenders trent reigning supreme 067 next y on penalty per 90 ahead of the pack the chasing pack as it stands here are coleman milinkovic and sigar santom its not going to stay like that those three will drop away its just because of the sample size trent wont drop away though trent will be there all season i think do you remember coleman back in the back in the glory days moring i remember going for bain over coleman and it was an absolute disaster that was a debate wasnt it baines over coleman the answer was both i think but i remember coleman out coleman outscored him was toward the end of banes like legacy coleman was a great asset though i loved it but hes not gonna stay hes not gonna stay this list trent is hes hes gonna hit a massive hole soon im sure he is hes gonna hes gonna hit a i dont know 12 13 pointer and i think it could well be in the next two weeks against one of these two teams at home so if youre wild card in six youre keeping trent i cant see unless slot drops him or it looks like hes massively falling out of favor or gets injured i cant see losing trent can you i think hes just hes gonna get close to 200 points for seven million in a defensive slot i see it that way i just i just think that itll take one big hall and then well see huge bandwagon i think it just hasnt arrived as yet british 87 saying is it no its nica saying suara suar suara wont drop he has got a very good that cant be right ita yeaha siga he has got a good reputation going forward and the numbers here may be sustainable the only reason why i think hell drop is because sampton as an attacking team wont allow him to sustain that he has got he has got the goal of course already and maybe there could be potential there as a four five box but i dont know ever play ever gonna play him well unless hes going to emerge as elaf davis threat and because i do see him as being a four five and hes down in 18th in this table with 013 x on p 90 well below sara but i expect i expect davis to climb that table as soon as it richs fixtures soften up so he for me still the one that i would go with if i was going to look for a four five from a promoted team of course romero and porro pretty solid id expect them to remain near this near this area certainly porro were not going to go for spurs for clean sheets all season but porro is a player thats still hanging on in a lot of teams probably will remain in my team for now porro for robertson is what im looking at robertson is 026 somewhat behind trent now do you think theres an argument there do you think the million gap can be bridged what him and trent no i think sometimes youve got to pick your battles when youre trying to cost cut and i just think trents got so much more to his game than robertson than robertson has is robertson six was he six5 hes six isnt he same as same as van d six okay so because it was that van was the cheapest wasnt it and then robinson was like one step up and then trent was the thing so hes id definitely go for him over van dijk but i id find the extra id find the extra million for trent i just i just think trent is nonnegotiable for me he would he would be just be the first player in my in my team i think you could even build a case for not going with harand like you have not going with salah anyone else i just if i see a team without trent i just think youre risking youre risking it here that is that is a seven million asset taking up a spot that you have to play a player in whos gonna hit a massive hole at some point to too much seventh eight nor 027 hes the one that could emerge when the fixtures get better for walls but they dont get better for a long time its newcastle and villa next home villa away then liverpool then brenford away then city its dreadful that not until you cant say brighton away is eas so you got to get to game week 10 you you say and is on even going to be in charge by then i hope so but if they lose every game up until gw 10 then theres going to be questions asked isnt there so eight nory could be someone we look at because these numbers are impressive shots per 9 172 chan cre 129 hes played left wing back now in a back three which i think will be the preferred system while they ride out these tough fixtures so he will he will remain in this top 10 i think and hell be someone well look at should oneal be there and theyre still playing wing backs and then i want to talk about lewis and viio because vs crept in no honestly vs crept he wasnt in this table last week but hes crept in after more attacking display 22 theyre vs the goto if you want security but theyre by far and away the city options arent they at the moment lewis is the interesting one of what you do again if youre on a wild card what you do with that cardio had an xgi of 055 that was mostly from i think one good chance that he that he created hes still not the marauding asset that we that we wanted and when youve got lewis there at 47 hes very attractive you need to have a bench that covers it if youre wild carding i you go safe and you pick like a dunk or mikeno see theres gavves now formul in and face so you can get rid of your ben johnsons and your barcos and not have to worry too much about it but i still want a bit more data on lewis i still want to see a couple games this arsenal games thats coming up is going to be massive because if lewis starts in that then and plays 90 again and then youve got five weeks have been playing 90 and he started the most important game one of the most important games they couldna have all season then clearly hes got that sewn up but walkers lurking foden back in training and lurking around i think i would punt on him but id want to give it a couple more weeks but you must be loving having you got little price rise out of well up to 47 got a couple of them got a couple out of him that was the gamble like i bought him for one game and hoped he would play well enough to keep his place he was impressive for england as well i just y he hasnt put a foot wrong yet so but we know pep like he could let him down but the way hes talking about him i think that hes there now i think i think hell have a place in that side i dont know what that means for walker whether walker gets europe well have to see and thats what we want the answers on and thatll be the case very soon niik williams in 11 seen a few mentions of him in chat the only query there he is far forward shots per 90 233 chances created one per 90 been an impressive starts the season for williams that weve had easy fixtures what i would say is moreno has been bought he could go at left back and ana could then get right back ana for me is a superior defender to williams and i think hes good enough going forward as well so nico not nailed long term so beware if youre thinking of doing that i wouldnt do that and well when we get our draft video out of our of our bickering weve got moreno there you assured me with as much vigor as i did with barco that moreno was gonna ask was gonna ask williams from the side so im expecting moreno to be in very soon and williams to be out or i will be very no i think i think maro will start its a different his quality going forward is strong neither williams or ana can offer that and i think we need that side because it does unlock h ado more to have a natural eff foot or outside him because at the moment we got a problem where we the fullback doesnt go around k h ador and hao wants to come inside so we dont have that threat around to overlap him so moro gives us that so you can see the logic know i think id get moreno i love i love watching moreno play if hes is he nailed down like a moring fullback role for a as weve seen a good defensive side under nuno in terms of the stats he could be an absolute steel at four five if we if we keep the good defensive data going through tougher fixtures so this is a good test for us now we go to liverpool and then weve got an easy game at brighton but after that he does s up youre going youre going to that im going to that looking forward to it but we cant do it again we cannot do the game what are you doing now what you going im in madrid im in madrid and i messed it up i think because when we were thinking of dates i had the forest game in mind but i put forest in the wrong week on the calendar id put it for this week coming forward so im im going to the ip switch game on saturday but i thought that was the forest game i know ab well last year you had already had plans concert want to see pay you cant turn that down they might not be play might not be alive much longer let playing the music so have to go to the city grounds in the new year weve got to do it because we keep threatening to do a vlog while were there as well and will enjoy that we do a live stream after ridiculous we havent got gone but absolutely well talk about ben white just down there in 45th he is aead of anthony robinson whos been the star for many fb teams so far this season but ben white hasnt created a single chance yet nothing from him so expect that to pi to pick up but not justifying the price tag at the moment for ben go cra id still go cra no fair enough lets look at mids h on whoa theres a play where do you want me to go where do you want me to go we have to talk bright defender lucas dean you dont want to go there if youre gonna talk people in the g luca dean you are and you me unless i mention luca dean even if its to say dont go there ive put him on there but if youre gonna chat people up into going luca dean youre asking for trouble after what you did to start the season no im im going to do the complete opposite im going to say that for anyone who might be newer to fantasy football or whoever who isnt quite familiar with lucaon to me he is the number one worst troll in fpl there it is there he is there is no one more of a i remember starting with him a few seasons ago and his underlying stats are good he got like blank and then scored own goal and then they conceded in like in like the 90th minute i think he scored an own goal and that is owning luca de he can be as good as you want he can have all the great stats great fixtures for villa i promise you bring him in youll regret it dont go there thats thats my thats my happ next big hall coming big hall coming for because hes thats what he does when you think hes hes gonna do well he doesnt whenever you think hes gonna do badly hes hilarious because he find he finds different ways each time and they get more bizarre by the minute dont they like hell get booked in the last minute when hes just about to get free bonus he crazy honest never known ive never known a player so consistently troll people who go there its unbelievable darwins getting there but well to be fair darwin is darwin and dean right up there midfielders you have to have one start to appear on this table which is why gacho is right at the top but hes only had 124 minutes a very small sample he exra on penalties is 119 hes right at the top of all midfielders but then like this week we get to the quality sorry was as i like g this week theres no question hes a good player hes not going to be number one for xg on penalty over the season he is going to drop down but i expect him to be there or thereabouts in the 30 for sure salah will probably be top in his table for most of the season hes there one extra non penalty per 90 at the moment and then diaz 094 de br a 093 diaz incredibly high and i want to bring up weve got our key performance indicators so ive got those again i just want to bring them up again because so this table is showing midfielders this season who have improved on their xg non penalty per 90 compared to last season gacho right at the top 079 we go down to diaz though so hes improved his xg non penalty per 90 by 037 but if you look across hes also improved his shots in the box per 90 by 022 n9 and his chances created by 90 by 060 so diaz at the moment even though its a small sample weve got a combination of the ey test and this data to suggest that diaz unders slot is a different player now it is too early we cant jump to conclusions but how much longer do you leave it before you have to start thinking diaz has to be in our teams well again to talk about the draft because that was window into what we were thinking we were we had a brief discussion didnt we about whether to draft jur or diaz because we could have had either i think it was our it our third pick wasnt it we could have had either and in the end we both agreed that diaz was the one to go for and at the start of the season i think we both would have said i went for jotter over diaz js our biggest fan but you were you also whal about diaz but i think we both probably would have picked y but its been a couple of weeks the itest supports diaz as the stats support diaz as well youve got that slight worried about the international minutes this week the fact darwin hasnt traveled anywhere i do wonder if hes going to give him a chance in the team over diaz but the way diaz has been playing be a bit risky wouldnt it to i think diaz starts he might only get an hour but i think he starts i just think hes just won all three games scoring goals diaz is on fire and i watched him i watched him in the in the internationals i watched him play for columbia against argentina he didnt he didnt sparkle to be fair so i was i was just interested to see how he perform in that but he has its just the positions hes taken up for liverpool that he is hitting that narrative that he would get more central he would get more far post and the cross is coming over from trent and salah thats where the creativity is all that side its all right side isnt it right salah their most creative player after trent and then you got soso that side as well so we did say like if the service is going to come in it does seem that js not being that big number nine getting on the end of stuff its diaz coming far post get on the end of it is j gonna become the new firmino who drops back still does all right but its manet and cah who were the ones back then and i think i said before the manchest united game i didnt think diaz has the potential to score as many goals as man did but two well taken goals against man utd two different types of goal as well and the counterattack goal he scored the week before that so hes scoring all different types of goals getting into the right areas like we keep saying stats are good everything you hes hes one to back i think because theres no real reason why that should digine decline youd think if hes still getting the chances hopefully that would improve and hed carry on doing well because hes clearly in the elite talent its just amazing that like gordon was so heavily linked wasnt he with liverpool and i think if gordon had signed i dont know how close they were signing gord if that had gone through i wonder if diaz would even be at the club right now because you presume hes going to play left side right you think so he not gordon coming to take salahs place would he so theyre paying 75m orever it was for gordon that could have been complete nonsense and maybe they were never in for gordon but there was a lot of rumors about it maybe agents al for contract maybe lets all back to b because he was unlucky at west ham disable luke williams bought him and was was waxing liverpol about how hes gone maverick again and he was unfortunate not to get return the in that game and but he stands out well here does he 023 is xgi up per 90 compared to last season interesting chances created a down 062 so hes not that creative force yet but shots are up 082 so hes being more direct fre game small sample etc de bry never going to be a factor foden coming back puts a shadow over it right did you see that interview he did about his pace in the news ea sports fc game hes hes been given 67 pace and he got his fifa card he looked and he was like think they must have red me when i was on crutches last season which i thought was very good i hope so foden is an interesting one isnt he because if lewis continues in that central midfield spot and walker doesnt come back foden its ridiculous to think the player of the season last year might struggle to find his way back into the team but city have looks so effective in those first few games that does foden automatically come straight back into the side probably but causes a bit of disruption to the way the way s been playing if things are as they are now i think de bruyne is a good option going in from game week seven because the fixures if you go back to the fixures for man city after that arsenal man and newcastle game were out the way full and wolf southampton bournemouth its a brilliant run of four games so we might be looking to pair har up with someone for those and if foden isnt in the picture then de bruyne is the next best option because you would trust anyone else im looking at that period when im going to play my w im not sure at the moment im thinking maybe between seven and eight which is the next international break and game week eight is when im probably gna have to get on a city player because i can i can maybe captain salah or sacka until then because sacks got saned at home game week seven when harand faces fulham so maybe i can i can play my sacker against your harland but certainly after that when harland goes to wall s anon b with if im not getting harland surely ive got to get some city attack there and i need foden to be back otherwise youre right maybe it will be maybe well be looking at at de bruyne and he hes showing hes showing a different player so far but its its free matches well see if that continues i wanted to mention matoma here as well because hes hes increased his extra on penalty per 90 by 018 his other factors are all down though touches in the box are down shots per 90 down as are shots in the box hes getting some traffic this week because of the fixtures where you stand on him well i was i was all in on him before this week i had my transfers planned before the i was ring watkins in for esack and i was going to ring matoma in for gordon i was pretty locked in on that and then i saw what happened with salah and i saw what happened with j pedro as well getting a getting that goal and getting another 90 and also the fact he wasnt supposed to be going on international duty and then gets bloody co up anyway because of because of an injury but well talk about him when the forwards come around it put me off mat a bit theres m there as well for a little bit cheaper but i do like the matoma pick and i think his i think particularly against ip switch i think he could do well in that game because hes got im sure most people listening to this have seen matoma play but hes an incredibly like talented and tricky player but hes got one move which just is so effective against weaker oppos opposition which is he gets the ball just outside the area he brings it to a complete stop and then he just kicks it far past the defender and just runs onto it and then just centers it into the into the penalty area and ill tell you that is going to cause whos it going to be a right back ben johnson or whoever is playing youd think ben johnson hes gonna hes gonna ruin the right back with that rip switch i just think him against newly promoted teams is going to be so effective because he was getting some joy in other games this season not so muchal well exactly against ashy l absolutely terrorized him so when hes playing against a maybe a less adapt right back hes going to be very effective the touch in the box for 90 is a bit concerning minus three on that but the ex number 90 is a bit higher because i think thats being thats been quite affected all for him like its interesting salah is the only big hitter here amongst the midfielders you look up the list and brunos up there so hes 84 and he has improved 027 improvement on his extra on penalty per 90 which could be of interest could be enough for people to hold him for one more week but salahs in there so salahs xg on penalty is up as are his touches in the box per 90s so and he shots in the box per 90s so the key performance indicators are shown that salah hes not in decline its going almost the what you make of his what do you make of his comments after the match because they they said to him whats happening with the contract or whatever and he said didnt he this is my last year at liverpool and i just want to enjoy it i dont know whether that is bluster to see if we what they can offer i dont think its going to affect him people have said do you think hes going to like simmer down as the season goes on as hes winding down and is he off to saudi that would be the most likely out come i think i think liverpool are going to be talking arent theyre going to be thinking hes going to be going i think hes going to continue to prove to be someone who can be elite i dont see him declining as yet and slot seems to be getting the best out of him so far and hes super fit so he can carry on playing in the premier league theres no question its whether or not he there desires of stays there i dont know its interesting isnt it and they got van dijk on the last year as well and there was speculation about trent so so is this the end of an era and are liverpool going to go full tilt for the title because of that is it going to be a motivational factor i dont know it is interesting to that i dont think thats gonna impact fbl at the moment though theres no sign of that its just sometimes when youve got these contracts i look at tony last season he just went completely off the boil didnt he i me was do you remember aubameyang when he signed a new contract and he didnt score for like an entire season as well so you can make as many narratives as you want about it but the fact is there is this thing going on with salah he said its his last year and he started the season maybe even better than he started any of the last couple of years if you were playing top trumps and the top trump category was professionalism and you had salah aubameyang and tony who would have professionalism very good very good point so i think its a different fish isnt it salahs not someone whos gonna i dont know hes hes not gonna let perform think that about aubameyang at the time though wasnt he and hed been scoring 20ish goals and got the goals in the fa cup and he was like the talisman of the side i dont know what happened with that and now all the stuff happened with chelsea and at barcelona his reputations in the mud but at the time it seemed when they gave him that they give like a fiveyear deal it seemed like that was a good bit of business i want people to invent top trumps with professionalism for footballism who be top who be top of your professional harry kane maybe i dont know is he professional i think he is given how long he stayed at spurs out winning anything thats true theres a lots of comments about bourou midfielders why would you buy too seeno toer were sleeping on toer says neils apples wow lots of the number of b is tavir so im having a bad night with pronunciation are the number of bourn midfielders that are featuring on this table and the table were going to go back to is quite extraordinary sinister tavanir seeno rutar i got that right see i got all those right can do it when i concentrate so theyre all in this table theyre all improved on last season and if we go back to the midfielders table youll see that theyre all there as well theyre all up there in the in the top echelons of this table for xg non penalty per 90 bournemouth as we saw with the attacking date if we go back to that were third i think third 195 of the season so what do you put that down to is it the fixures havent been that easy theyre showing red there do you think that we need to start taking them seriously as a source of value because seeno has been the one thats jumped out so far but maybe hes that it doesnt stop there maybe tavanir could be an option they have played everton thats always a slight boost to those more i thought i thought theyd struggle more i thought theyd be i like i like bournemouth as a as a unit i like the manager as well and i think he did great things with them i thought losing slanky though would be big adjustment period bigger than we thought but they did have simino who last season stepped up with the goals been eight goals to him four assists across last season so thats the difference between him and taver is taver never got anywhere near those numbers i think he got about half or maybe even less of the attacking returns probably like five or six attacking returns last season whereas sea now looks like hes moving up even more i like him at 55 i think hes an option and i think again when we talk about going for h and going for salah having to play three five fivs i think rogers seeno and pedro is a pretty decent three who were all underpriced i was looking at how i could wild c now and get to salah harland and it would involve dropping down to a soeno from sun but i looked at it and thought what does that feel like it is a big drop because of the historical the legacy that son has got in fbl hes an elite player no question almost describable as a heavy hitter he has been in other seasons but seeno when we talked about diaz as a player who could be exceed in his value seeno definitely fits into that bracket as well and its its just how long we wait before we start going we got to take this seriously hes definitely hes definitely providing what we hope rogers would at the moment and i dont know if thats gonna stop and evan nilson has arrived for bournemouth but he doesnt strike me as a player whos gonna cil seenos attacking verve so to speak hes had so many shots he look up for it as well like when just before it all turned for everton simenia was involved in a altercation he was he was fired up he wasnt giving up that game despite the fact they were two two down so i like that fire about him and the fixures are good chelsea at home former for would have chance in that they beat them last year didnt they cant if it was at sanford br or if it was if it was at their ground but they definitely they definitely beat quite early in the season but then its liverpool then southampton and leicester so got that little they b theyre bott of the ticket from game four for 12 so out of this run theyve got two very strong blue fixtures its the southampton leicester double up that arsenal have also got they do have liverpool arsenal villa away city brenford away brighton at home its tough it is the toughest run on here so you can be forgiven for ignoring seeno at the moment because of those fixtures but we might be sleeping on him we might if you if youve got the ability to bench him in against liverpool and against arsenal and then you probably look to take him out after the run but that still gives you three good fixures i think to make that strategy of going with the premiums more viable because when youve got min smith rogers and him and then pedro thats five all under six million we have weve never had that before people saying that the move to embo has got to come it has got to come i think hes 15th in his table hes got three goals already in 269 minutes 63 extra on p think it will stay there he hasnt had a pen yet but that will be did you see did you see the southampton highlights yes suicide its exactly what i said at the start of the season didnt i said martins not going to change and they havent the thing is they havent its like burnley they dont have the quality to play in that way at this level so i do worry dont get me wrong i think emba is a great pick and i think hes going to be probably a must from game week six onwards but i just wouldnt take anything from that southampton game because i they were just it was comical genuinely comical how they were playing the mistakes they were making the invitation for the press against one of the best pressing sides in the league as well why are you messing around passing the ball out from the back like get rid of it i know no one wants to hear people say that i said got howard bellis is a good player but bednar jack stevens theyre not theyre not good strong premier league defenders who are good with the ball at their feet i would theyre okay theyre not theyre not necessarily poor defenders but i wouldnt associate them with being players who are press resistant right so and i remember when martin b swansea does a city ground we were just catching them and they wouldnt change he just carried on letting us do it and thats what i fear that could happen to s anon i hope not because i dont want the promoted scenes to go down but what i saw at brenford was what i thought would happen whether or not martin does start going a bit more direct he can change because he has done he got the team up by changing the approach in the playoffs so well see what happens next but they cant do that he wont have an easier game all season in aumo to get two goals sure it was just ridiculous but hes a quality player theres no question if youre wild card in six which youve talked about what are you doing about brenford are you going in bumo you probably have to dont you the fixtures are so good and he is the best asset from that side so you probably you probably go at least one defender and then bumo go a defender would you i think you fleen you got youve got vanderberg havent you were hoping that he comes in if you got a four million asset with the fixtures theyve got that again frees up a bit of money to do what you want with other areas hes a good player i think he will get in i think hes too good not to get in that side what who he comes in for would be the question but another player i want to mention just so that we can clip this and say look we did mention him i told you jack gish i think or delete it b i ignore what im about to say if he does nothing for the next if he does score next week then its all down to us want the credit the numbers suggesting and what were seeing playing for england as well greish could be turning the tide a bit hes only had 91 minutes and the numbers are up do you think theres a chance that we could start seeing somewhat the jack gish we saw at villa no you dont see it no because why would he suddenly change the what hes he won the treble playing in a certain way which was his best fpl season for city and it wasnt that great it wasnt like we were all i think he was in my team for a bit and he got a couple of returns but he never looked like someone getting 15 20 attacking returns in that season lets be honest its not going to get any better than that for him is it that was him playing 90 minutes almost every week for a treble winning side this is him barely in the side with more competition n not gonna happen its interesting talking about ian right was talking about for england saying that to stay in carys thinking hes got to be playing for city and hes been hes done the two seasons now hes a hes not a veteran at city but hes certainly a senior player there now its staying in that team will he be able to do enough and what role will he continue to play the role where he is hes effectively being the magnet for defense so they can create space which is what hes been there hes not been its not been about output for greish its been about sacrificing his own output for the gains of the team i just wonder whether thats going to change because pep what pep will do which all good managers do is theyll change the way they play they cant keep playing the same way and theyll theyll reinvent players within system and so i just wonder whether theres something worth keeping an eye on im not saying its going to turn into output yet but i think its its worth certainly when foden is back and we start to see what peps gonna do and whether or not he is going to change things up whether greish becomes a different type of greish id rather id rather pick doco at the moment i think hes just i think even if greish plays were still not sure hes just going to get the ball recycle it and everything oras at least if you get 45 minutes from do hes going to go we remember we i think was it last season we were like guos gone out and bought dau who was greish from when he was a villa that tricky winger well see we cant judge city until theyre back to full strength until rod is there until fodens there and thats thats what well see but i just want to keep an eye on and just thought id mention it because its always nice then go we didnt mention him mention another 10 players and one of thems going to come in surely so is talk about sacka and odard then because sacka has this table 13th 072 odard could be out for a while premier league put this up this is based this is completely ripped off a premier league article but i feel like put format so exactly well i had to do that because it was so blurry and hard to read on their format plus of course they did miss off shots per 90 even though they mentioned in the article so that was a bit slack of them terrible standards so i had to put shots for 90 in there now ive highlighted the key stats the point points per 90 the arsenal gain with odard 21 and its 17 without odard so not a major drop but a drop nonetheless with odard starting shots per 90 go down from 159 to 133 and goals per 90 go down from 209 to 163 so thats the biggest drop the win percentage as well as worth talking about there 66 win rate with odard 52 without him now i look at this think yes theres a drop but then you look below the pink bar there and you look at possession you look at pass the final third passing accuracy passing accuracy oppositions half no difference no difference to that whatsoever so it doesnt affect their pattern of play without him it does affect their results but that could be down to were talking about 19 matches with that could purely be down to the opposition right it could be down to so i dont look at this and think its disastrous for arsenal like many people are saying do you my bigger worry is what we touched on earlier which is having to move havs back and playing a false nine system with trossard i think this is this is where everyone thought arsenal would go out and get a striker this time and jays had a pretty good preseason i think a lot of trust was put in him im still im still not convinced hes hes the one to be leading the title charge for them for them up front although i did think that about hz and hes hes stepped up havs is so effective at the moment that taking him away from that role is what worries me so its going to be what hav parte and who else is going to be in the midfield h parte and because rice is out guards out geino gonna come in could do a bit of a crappy midfield isnt it they got sterling right we havent talked about him is he gonna be a factor he could go he could go up would he go false nine over trossard im not going to go im not going to start the sterling false 9 prop my point is that theyre playing spurs next its a massive game for them spurs will surely be looking at that midfield and thinking we can for the first time we can dominate that mids we can dominate that midfield dominate a big word i think or get at them hs parans and who you who did you just say georgino georgino is not bad is either but i think i do think that he going to stifle the amount of amount of chances they get in that game and it is spurs theyre going to be leaky but i think they might be relying on more of a from a corner like that where spurs are weak from corners and theyve got gabrielle and celba i dont know how many open play goals or how many chances theyre going to create with that with that midfield mr greg is a regular hello greg hes reminded us that martin and have a sacka trossard they can get some goals i totally agree so what im going to show some more dat lets lets show some more data first this is this is totally ripped off i just rip people off should put this off an opto analyst i do go to the trouble of finding his stuff and researching and reading the article so thank you opter analyst for this stuff this is number of involvements in open play shot ending sequences which i love as a stat so its a events that are leading to either a chance created a shot on goal or a shot ending sequence so hes played a part hes made a pass in a sequence thats ended in a shot hes the top midfielder in the premier league last season for that so that goes against what i said about two minutes ago where arsenal miss him so much this would indicate that they would but i will say also look whos third sacka right so they have got someone there who can take that up and fill that void to some extent its not like theyre not going to create chances about odard there because theyve got an elite player in sacka of course but that is significant you would say theres no question they will miss him deck and rice could arguably be an even bigger miss so we dont know what were going to get from arsenal in this game im gna show you one more graphic again for mto analyst and this i think if you if you were to ask arsenal fans who the one player they would want to not be out of this game its between rice sacker and odard but i think it would be odard i think hes the worst player they could lose for this the captain like the fact the impact has other positions in the team the way he started the season has been impressive bad no im not im not questioning that and then this adds more field to the fire this is the chances created by sacka and odard as a pairing when they fed each other for shots and their combination which i think is 46 chances between them is the biggest of any pairing in the premier league last season wow didnt know that nicely plagarized mark i know so if theres a if theres a narrative to say well sacka would be fine with odard well this suggests that its a big blow to him because as a pairing theyre incredibly effective good news for me as a as a probable seller of sacka this week i cant i cant make a strong case for saying its not gna have an impact the only thing i would say is that what arsenal and man city have in common is theyre going to drive each other in every game this season there is no question arsenal and man city will go into every game and play every minute as if theyve got to win that game there are no games that arsenal or city are going to play where its one all with five minutes to go where theyre not going to go all out to win it now im not saying you would think well thats the case of any team i dont think so i think the intensity in which city and arsenal play and fight for every point to the very last minute is higher than any other teams in the league maybe liverpool will get there this season but the reason why theyre top two is because theyre driven by managers you will create that arsenal will go to spurs regardless of their lineup and they will expect to win and they will fight to win to the final whistle so theres no way that spurs are going to roll them over twonil there is no way if arsenal lose it will be 32 43 ridiculous i dont think arsenal will lose i think theyll still win the game so i still think arsenal will score more than one goal possibly two maybe three even without odard and rice because their desire to win every game to win this title and this season theyve probably got more chance than any and less od guards out for ages well carry them through i think and therefore if i think arsenal are going to do that theyre going to win the game theyre g to score at least two goals im not selling sacker i think sps are goingon to win do you i think spurs are gonna win it i think again you talk about drive and all that i think theyre going to look at this and think were not going to get a better chance were not going to get a better chance in the next few years to beat ar to beat arsenal the fact its a home game as well early in the season put a dent in their title charge right now theres no bigger motivation for spurs theyre not as good a team but with the with the missing players for arsenal its a lot more even i think that its be a good game but i just think what ive seen from arsenals artetta is they find a way now and i think that theyre growing as that team all the time and i think that these are major blows theres no question and theyve got europe and then theyve got city its a tough period for them to lose declan rice in this one game but also oar to injury no question i think it is being overplayed in that people are going morenos out and so on its like theyre not even in the team yet cury is not in the team and you those four names are being mentioned arsenal are going to be without these four key players hold on a minute two of them havent even played yet so people want to build this narrative up that theyre absolutely crippled by injury theyve lost two major key players no question but i still think theyre going to win that game and thats why i think that im okay holding sacka i wouldnt wouldnt i wouldnt not endorse going sacka to sell out i see the logic in it but i wouldnt be surprised if saaka still comes through and get something out of that game because arsenal i think will still win it im expecting im expecting him to get something from the game but i dont think its i would be a lot more worried when i saw rigar go off i that made my mind up that sack was going to go i think before that happened i was looking at spending the money because id already done esack to to pedro so because i thought there was going to be a double a price drop for eack and a price rise i got the price rise but not the price drop but then i was looking at other things i could spend the money on rather than getting rid of sacka because i thought i can keep him play him against spurs but once odard got off i thought now thats thats just one thats just an extra incentive now to take a punt on him not delivering him next two it just feeds into the narrative though if sck returning that game last season and if he does you can just see people go but then the odard injury convinced me theyll say as black box presenting all those numbers partnership true i there need to support selling sacka to go sell and i absolutely see that its of course its logical sells got great fixures sacks in a team without two key players with tough fixures absolutely makes sense the only question i would ask is do you think arsenal can win at spurs i think can so if theyre going to win at spurs sacks got a good chance youve done well youve played both sides like a ab ive nailed my colors to the to the sicker out mast and here you are genius this is how you get away with this stuff and i dont genius i know years of experience doing this stuff lets talk about forwards its a shame about havs because my tactic ahead of gw six is going to be and hopefully still can be isaac to hav just as you say because i want to get on i want to go treble arsenal and if im not wild carding then ill i plan to save two transfers going into six and get inmo and havocs at that point so if oars out that could that could dampen my enthusiasm for but hes here hes ninth in the table 053 hes got two goals one assist its been a good start for your favorite sunday league player as hes hes started i was definitely put off by the positional reclassification a mid moving to a forward and he needed to do what hes been doing and hes been very effective in it if youve got him you still you still play him dont you i dont think hes a hes a cell he can still do damage from the eight position thats the position where i wanted to see him last season and i didnt think he could make it in that in that nine because wed seen him at chelsea playing across all different positions and not nailing his own he started off from the wing for them didnt he and then moved a bit more central then dropped back and never made any position his own well hes definitely made that nine position his own and i think going into going into those games against southampton and leicester you want sacka you want to pair another attacker i think for those two it has to be habt especially now od got out agree harlem we dont need to talk about the only thing i would say about harland is 71 accuracy 50 conversion that will regress there is no question he cant maintain that whether that means that hes going to have significant regression of xg on penalty i dont know were expect it to come down somewhat but itll hover around where it is now 105 but he wont get 1372 90 so that will start coming down i hope he had another good chance though that west had four could had four in that game and i have never when we talk about players going back toback hatrick and regressing ive never been less convinced about regression than i am talking aboutand because brf at home as well it wouldnt be completely out of the realms of possibility if he got a hattrick of hat tricks what i can as someone who would go into harand without harland again is that frank thomas frank is a shrewd tactical manager brenford are a team who will play fre at the back and they do have physical presence at the back and i think that i think that theyll do enough to keep him down to maybe one goal thats what i hope b brenford aren a bad side away from home theyre not going to get skittled three or four nil i dont think and also after international break we often see some drop off clip that not the greish nonsense if i offered you if i offered you a forest onenil win for a harland hattrick would you take it yes of course its a forest one anfield of course i would im forest first fbl second but be like sal captain three million rank be a bit of me like that i was three million this time last year in the world and didnt there so id take it for a one0 forest for sure harlem will aggress because that conversion rate that accuracy is not going to continue but like i say you when you talk about regression youre confident normally but youre not when youre talking about harland are you at all wher up there which great to see im not going to propaganda him anymore because being arrogant about having him in my team but watkins lets talk about watkins where what are we doing here its an enigma isnt it whats dreon wrong is hes got a niggling injury is he being must have mustnt he i think it must be like that salanki injury when he was like carrying something but he was still playing and it wasnt bad enough to restr him but sank game is a bit different to watkins isnt it watkins relies more on the pace id say to get him behind because slank drops deep and slanky can be involved in that whereas watkins needs to hit on the break so its affecting him more he hasnt been pictured in training has he havent we havent seen any training images of him were talking about watkins are we talking about neither have neither have as well as it as it stands time stamp thursday night 11 o climing 11 o00 but watkins again before the last episode you and i were esack to watkins 100 we are not going into everton at home without watkins everton did their best to show us why we shouldnt be going against that because they completely capitulated and philip definitely gonna get chances against them but another 60minute cameo and then not seen or heard of in two weeks they have got champions league to come right so we know thats thats thats l in and so that might managing the load is something that emory will have in mind and presumably watkins is going to be playing champions league games all of them because of the new format theyve got an able deputy in duran right so this is always bring that player on and that player is coming on and scoring goals so its a worry isnt it we definitely cant look at watkins now as an assured asset because we want more we with the injury time were not just losing 60 minutes were losing 35 30 minutes were losing 35 to 40 minutes right and we know that the xg typically in premier league the xg in blocks of time is stronger at the end of a game right thats where the greater amount of xg is generated so losing a player consistently for the last 30 minutes is not someone we want so we cant go there yet i dont think hes ready to play 90 minutes i from what from what ive seen so far i think it would be more of a surprise if he played 90 against everton than it would be he either didnt start or played 60 again and because of that playing those odds i dont think you go there hes too much money with so many other good assets around nine 10m and no penalties which is now going to morgan rogers after his was it for the under 21s ringland took it well great ben great ben that would be handy it might be the only way he gets us any leeding points well he might get him if watkins isnt playing because bloody watkins that keeps messing up his assists its true rogers is great im keeping him for sure anyone else you want to pick out here evan nson good start but only 135 minutes so far chris wood is just l does he keep his does he keep his place whens he gonna get dropped i just dont see big t being fit enough yet i dont think i think were going to go force nine at hfield i dont think chris wood will start that will hurt yell you wont be happy to hear that ive just got a theory were going to play james w prows play anderson behind gibbs white and play sorry have you ever weve done for nine we did a for nine preseason and i think we did it at anfield last season which didnt go well so i woods traveling back because hes been in international duty plus of course i think we need to get james war pr in the team at anfield because with alanga and hudson adoy win three kicks around the box and youve got youve got someone who can score them right so our best route to goal could be winning three kicks around the box right and weve got players in gibbs white langer and hudson andor weve got players who can absolutely do that so i think wood would just slow things down and i dont ive got an inkin he wont start you dont like wood do you i well you cant knock him because theres a p because very good because i think its some like 16 goals isnt it since the since he broke into the team so i think hes scored more open play goals than any other any other forward ridiculous other than irand so his record is incredible but and he just finds a way but its the role he plays in our buildup he does slow our attacks down and hes not i dont know i just think at w anfield the graph that well get from having gibbs white in a force n might be the way we go so lets see lets see what happens theres theres a couple more i think we should just cover aware were reaching the 2our mark rapidly hav done predictions yet but i know theres lots of people talking about welbeck theres lots of people talking about pedro as hes played 45 minutes for brazil and hes got the private jet back and all the stuff going around that but which one of those would you would you go for because im im seeing this there is a lot of talk about them people are worried about pedro so theyre going for welbeck shortterm welbeck but longterm jiao pedro i just i just think herzler likes him hell get the pens i think it i do think that hell end up in the nine brighton better than me but i just think he offers him a bit more than well and well backck hes m you got to manage his minutes so youre probably while youre in people players like rout are getting up to speed wck starting but i think when rout is available well see the change and it wont be j pedro losing his plays i think itll be world back so i think i can see why were going world back now because the trip back and is y pedro going to start i think will i think he will start what do you think i think he might i think he might come on at halim i saw with matoma last season that would be my prediction that he comes on a he comes on at halim but he is the not the fact hes played those 90 minutes in all three games does show the importance that hes valued at in the side which he wasnt getting last year so hopefully starts welbeck is a good option if youre going to be wild carding in six and there is a part of me that wishes i had gone welbeck i went pedro early because he wasnt supposed to be going to brazil he was supposed to be staying at home was a shocker wasnt it having a nice little rest so if i was buying one now and while cing in six i think i probably would go wellbe because i think hes almost certainly gonna start the next two is he gonna be in the team by game week six hell start well beck will start the next two im sure he will i just think the longer it goes on and new players bed in m mat rs out so but hes not a factor youve got two youve got two weeks with welbeck as an almost i say guaranteed start because he could miss out in seven but hes definitely starting this week but pedro is the much better longterm option and if youve tuned into black box this season when as talks about brighton players youve got to listen dear lets talk at our prediction standings before we get into our predictions and were were were almost neck and neck in fact we are sc 27 sc i want to talk about hotline at the top or hottin or whatever you want unbelievable 77 correct outcome thats ridiculous i know its only three weeks but even that a 27 correct score as well this is crazy numbers so i we need to tap into what hes doing because thats crazy i presumably hes a professional gamber and winning a fortune off the boogies every week but that is in i sense there might be a bit of a drop off from hot you mean its gonna fall for the floor noran if he continues that over the season then hed be wishing he played super six rather than just our stupid our stupid game shar in hottin i can if you do want to get involved in this you can join the blackbox patreon there still time fre game in but you if you want to be winning the trophy which is very did you see this youve got the trophy we should put a snip of it in shouldnt we next week well stick it the trophy now exists its no longer a figment of our imagination its been delivered and it was described as very heavy from richard as well as being very nice of course but there is there is a trophy for the winner of the patreon blackbox league and a trophy for the winner of the predictions league as well which is currently been one by time its a heavy trophy but sleeper and manscaper playing for the post so its all fine exactly see we do invest back exactly it all goes back into the channel right predictions now achingly familiar these again arent they so ampton man united youve gone two one united ive gone 31 these are very very boring similar arent they again we dont look at these we just put our scores in and then we only see them when we clip this for the show okay were going away were man united so not too much to talk about there i dont fernandz though come well look at the captains in a minute brighton its which both gone 30 that be dream me being at the amx that would be an amazing result palace leester weve both gone two nil come on mateta get me something the bottom of the forwards list im likely to have e more on that in a minute but yes fham west h both g a draw youve gone to all ive gone one all that might have something to with the fact that smith row could be going for me so on bench this week you fcy goals do you i found this one probably the hardest one to predict i dont know i havent seen a lot of great stuff from fulham so far and west ham were absolutely brilliant against palace and then awful it is man city but poor against them so i just went with the logical draw i feel enough and then filam west ham weve mentioned already liverpool versus forest youve gone 31 ive g 31 31 as well crazy how we go here i think i think we do score i think we do score but then liverpool kill us off this is different rather man city versus brenford ive gone a no bias whatsoever i dont own harland ive gone two nil you do own holland you gone 41 hatrick hat tricks well you see them giving them a hide in do you i think so theyre just on it at the moment and look at brenford when they play liverpool they rolled over i dont i dont see it i think thomas frank sides dont do that theyve had some joy against city in the past as well home and away so i dont know i dont see it being that i think that city win harand gets something but ive gone two nil villa everton were both back in three goals for villa one for everton for you im going 30 though youve gone 31 not have contour and i do its funny i got accused of marks predictions he only predicts the scores because hes got players his team what a surprise that i predict scores according to my fantasy team of course i do i wouldnt have the players if i didnt think theyre g its crazy some of the things we get accused of you up well there is some ages of you havent seen any of those comments youre not gonna youre not going to not own har and then go i think man city gonna win 7even nil of course youre not youre not going to do that anyway villa versus everton weve done bourma versus chelsea close to being the garden center game but because is an eight oclock kickoff i dont think we can find a garden center open at that time but youve gone two one ive gone two all i know you fancied him turn them around i can see it because bournemouth started well hav been very impressed with chelsea could even beat west ham could palace at home and i think other than that like mad 15 minutes against wolves they havent been that great they were all right against man city in the first game but couldnt find a way through i like bournemouth a good team first score weve had first out i know first one terrible home win ive gone a draw next ones this ones different though and this is interesting and again could be the bias because youre youre selling sacka right and im not what a surprise that it affects our predictions youve gotten spurs win and youve told talked about it tonight and you see this as an opportunity for them 21 youre going for its close you might be right they might need three maybe to do it but i just think im gonna im gonna back sam and say sams gonna inspire them to a narrow a narrow victory theyll be delighted would they with a two1 a guitar store at this stage of the season theyll only i reckon theyd wish that it comes at the end of the season and they can snatch them from getting the title but its too early to kill arsenals title hopes off but having said that any defeat is going to hurt when its man city youre chasing i think in hope salanki will be back for this well nothings been seen of him no he was close though they said for the last game against newcastle i just have an inland hes not gonna turn up again right my policy has always been with an injury just sell him because ive been on the end of countless man hes on his way back and hes we think hes back on it and it just goes on for weeks and you just never know how much honesty youre getting so i wouldnt be surprised if hes not back you can get mata like me and get two points every week its a lot more fun ive gone two on arsenal i do think spurs score and im probably gonna hold on because i do think this could go i think arsenal win but it could be 32 there could be a lot of goals here which with the arsal defense you would think no but youre right youre without declan rice without odard what are we going to get so its incredbly difficult game to predict youd hold it and then the final game which ive identified as the as the garden center game its sunday 430 its a prime time for garden center but we both predicted loads of goals strang youve gone youve gone 31 newcastle away win ive gone two all i think it i just dont see the defens is standing up here well ill be back in brunwood watching this with my parents hopefully my moms cooking a nice ro dinner want to play now then dont think he will this would be my nightmare result so ive gone the opposite way to you of predicting what would be good for my team because if newcastle win 31 and ive sold esack that is probably going to be maximum pain and i think isak gets something i need is i know im im not that confident that sacka and esack is outscored by salah and pedro especially if i think pedro could be benched for 45 i think its close and using two free transfers on it as well i dont know tempting the fbl gods and we know what they do when we do that i dont i dont feel great but im im hoping that wolves can find a bit of form at home and newcastle ive looked a bit labored so far but isach started the season in good form for sweden scored the goal against spurs as well im a bit worried you see his comments about fpl managers as well lovely that wasnt it great and ially said he said he was going to score two goals despite me he said i love it when people sell me and then i do well yep again its watching that is horrible isnt it because you can just imagine going god and he warned us and theres just so many things that you can see being played back why that game got to be last in the game i could be having a good game we and it gets to that and then he just goes mad and just ruins me absolutely horrible captains isaac features on this table because its a good fixture of w wolves but were looking at its harem versus sal isnt it theres no question if youve got both where are you going harland you are going harland hes top of the xj on penalty 105 over sell one youre going harland interesting i minut before we look at rob ts data which is always useful we throw it in at this point anyone else you want to pick out here would you be tempted anywh else bruno br after watching southampton defend last game hes hes the one but i wouldnt trust man utd at all pedro if we knew pedro was gonna start he could be a great option but i think were gonna get mean how many times this season and we need to bring up the matrix here are we going to be discussing any other player avn c and harland i know its three weeks and theyve top scored and theyve delivered so that will change but you do start to wonder whether the bracket underneath when were looking at the sacka son bruno de bruyne foden thats the bracket underneath are they going to be able to make a step up because at the moment they havent yet and its about what you talked about sacker earlier the ceiling versus salah and harlands not the same is it i do hope they do push up but i just its not happening yet is it were gonna have those two weeks of southampton and leicester where sacka is going to be very popular but other than that i think its going to be holland and sah but if youre paying 15m for holland you need to captain him every week with the odd exception of a tough game when someones got a good one because like five and six okay but youre gonna if youve got harand youre going to captain him between seven and 10 i imagine there it is in the matrix you look at that run seven and 10 its full of at home walls away so home bournemouth away i worry about not having him during that per i can cover it with sacka for game week seven game week eight though where do i go where will i will i still have son i dont think so i you go sal dont you home to chelsea but you do salah in a home fixture of course but then salah goes to arsenal when harlands at home to santon so ive got to where do i go there im not gonna have watkins or palmer am i so me saying i dont know when im gonna wild card i think i think im going to be faced with having to unless ive got some city cover then am i going to captain fen over harland maybe but nines a savage week nine is a savage week for if youre going non harland that is because thats theres gonna be triple captains out on harland again that week and you cant go salah at arsenal and sacka own to liverpool can you i dont know could be a game of goals and you probably have to dont you have to back goals and hope that salah will return watkins doesnt deserve to be on this list does he at the moment but by then he could he could be more of a factor for us but youre definitely not captaining watkins at the moment even with everton at home and we were talking about it again last episode saying watkins could be a captain opportun for us this week no chance lets look at robs data rob t robt fbl he puts out excellent graphics like this based on spreadex betting odds and no question citys 295 projected goals 46 percent chance clean sheet versus liverpool 28 projected goals those two right out in front with brighton 240 so those three teams are the ones expected to get the goals this week no surprise and like you said he does favor it does favor harland over salah here not only because the amount of goals projected but also the monopoly that harland has on city goals versus salah so yes i think if you got both you go harland if you havent got harland youve got a good bet in seller this game week but thats going to change as we get later in the season from game week seven onwards weve got a problem so weve got to address that and see what we do capy though i think is pretty cut and dry lets look at our teams in to round up on this is yours as talk us for it for the podcast this is mine so henderson in goal with home game against leicester im hopeful with some he can build his four points from last week its trent porro and robinson in defense im happy with that porro has got arsenal but im backing them to win so then theres no way theyre going to get a clean sheet but he is still taking up ridiculous positions its sacka jotta gordon and rogers which was a disappointing midfield last week sacka is gonna go tonight i think for salah sacas very close no sacks close to a price drop it doesnt affect me because hes already gone up one so i dont need to make a move tonight but it is probably gonna be sacka to ss getting a price drop is he hes gone up to 106 now hes now hes dropping i think so many people are making that move to and then har and captain mata whos been disappointing since i bought him in now has entia and pedro who came in very early in the international break and smith were on the bench so if pedro does miss out completely or if har misses out completely because there is some talk about one of his friends has sadly passed away hes been theyve said that he might be given compassionate leave for it which would rock the boat but hes been training today i dont think thats going to happen but want to monitor make sure your bench is at least lined up correctly just in case i saw that in the chat and i thought well i better not highlight that comment because ive not heard that and that is like thats furious speculation that we dont want to throw in at this stage but right he has he has trained today though so i think its unlikely i think he missed he missed a bit of time to go and not deal with it deal with it himself but hes he seems back but maybe hell be given a bit of time its unlikely fair enough what do you expect then green arrow im a bit worried about quite a few players josa gordon rogers mateta havent delivered for me yet this season pedro might be benched poo concedes henderson coned somehow much disaster is what youre but mata has got lester at home so its not bad pedro has got ip switch rogers has got everton so it could go completely the other way and i will have sal and harland so im gonna predict about to finish the week about where i am 800 kish youll take that right that be right this is me rya lewis trent coner smith rose son salah captain sacka rogers isak and xal pedro i am going to make a transfer and that transfer will be smith row to e i have the money to do that thats nice and then the idea will be that i will probably roll next week and then go take true transfers into game week six and go sonto and bumo isach to havs is what im potentially looking at although looking at the captaincy coming up there might be grounds for keeping son because he could give me a route for the captaincy if i dont go harland so i dont know i want in bumo for that run but i do have there so i have some cover of brenford for six this week how will i do like every week it will depend what harland does so my fate is in his hands because i think salah could eas i think salah will return i think forest will lose i think theyll score two or three goals as ive said in my predictions i think ill get something from sacka i probably will get a clean sheet out of lewis probably i could get a clean sheet from trent but i do think we score coner could keep a clean she as well i think its going to be an okay week but if you dont have holland its down to that if he blanks youre going to get a green arrow if he scores youre going to get a gray or red its its the way its going at the moment if you can get both here thats the way to go it depends on what my supporting cast does if son e sacka isak in particular me isak could be a key player for me because if hes getting heavily sold then if he returns then he could be a difference maker so its interesting these are scenarios that im glad weve got theres theres such variety in the way teams are going and players who could have had that game week its a its a wider pool isnt it than normal and but those fringe players are so key because if you if you dont have a palmer and he goes off or you dont have a sack or you dont have a har and you cant have them all you need your fringe players your rogers your matas your smith rose whoever to chip in with some points to try and make up that deficit a bit and if youre on the wrong side of the premiums and your supporting cast arent chipping in points you could you could have an absolute people can catch up 30 40 points on you quickly this year theres going to be a lot of big swings for people this year and its youre not going to get it right every week but you just need to hope that youve got players in who can who can make up the difference im trying not to look at other peoples teams and say im im going to logically get do the right move which i think is smith ro tza i like that and then ive got to hope that one of son isak or saaka come in for me because if all three of them blank and harland scores im getting red so ive got to get something from sonak and sacka i think one of theyre a good for theyre good players so i think one of those three will return and theyre all going to be pretty significant differentials the way the market has gone because isak and sacka are leaving teams and son isnt in many teams so i think ill be okay but its its the way its every week im like that and i dont mind that i dont mind that i want to rely on a broader range of players rather than just the heavy hitters which was a lot of last season it was like well if palmer and salah and harand come in youre going to do well and they were doing well every week so its better it feels better and im im so hyped about this season the way its going so far im im not concerned how well im doing im more concerned at the moment about the state of fbl and the way it is and its getting me excited again about playing it which is a good thing which just four players the same this week team and at spells last year for the first time ever we had 11 players the same and it felt horrible didnt it you were like 150 points ahead of me wasnt ideal and were were more or less neck and neck so its i like it i like where we are i like where the seasons at i like the decisions were having to make i like the dilemmas and the fact that people are selling eak and sacka and going i dont feel happy about it thats great thats what the d thats the dilemmas we want playing this game right we dont want decisions to be easy we want to be punished at times and make us think twice thats what playing this game should be about so well see well see im looking forward to the weekend thats where we go apart from youve got two wild card teams to have a look at do you want to show them now we got over the two hours and might sck them up whats behind these then this is wild card one this is the harland only team i just thought i thought theres a lot of people on wild cards this week so i thought we could at least touch on something so i just had to go putting together like i said i wrote the article just with a couple different ideas one i totally ignored well until well only when you found out it was m me thats thats fine but this is using plan fpl this was a while closing up because thats thats with ver bragen and flecken in goal with trent lewis and gayy sber and greaves on the bench so youve got s that comes in for the great fiction gay week six its son in to target these two and then youd look to switch him over to sacka i prefer son for the next two weeks given i think spurs are gonna win this game and then sak and then e diaz and m and then haren captain i think i would still go for watkins if i was on a wild card this week although thats looking each day that passes and hes hes gonna start everton isnt he unless he is injured i think i would go for him but you could also move to isack and just take the guaranteed start against wolves i dont mind that either and then pedro and then fleen rogers sleep and greaves on the bench i think this is a pretty strong team to world card into theres no real weakness there i dont think and youve got the double up on bright the triple up on brighton for the next two as well the ar defender on the bench as well skews the strength of it a little bit and what youve got then i youve done this to show the difference between the teams with salo and harand so this is the salo and harand team and i dont hate this so this is ray in goal with trent lewis and gayi so same back three but ray is in instead of the the rotation because its a bit cheaper to do that because you havent got to pay six million for cba saka e salah m and rogers and then harland and jel pedro up top and then the bench youve got to play you got have two four billion defenders to have this so stevens and greaves are both starting ive managed to get dap in there as like another option as a five5 you could put him down to a four five and strengthen the defense somewhere else give yourself a bit of a bench i dont hate this its got ry its got trent its got sacka its got salah and harland the issue is the issue is that youve got m rogers and pedro all under six million that you have to play every week and you cant move away from them i look at this and go where are my transfers going to be a week unless im moving e out im not going to be touching trent or lewis if lewis stays on the team im okay i could move four five defender out in and out but thats thats a lot of fun isnt it so my input into this team for a good period unless theres injuries will be which five am i gonna move out this week it is do i bring in do i bring in i dont know if i want that game this might well be the an optimal lineup is that a lineup i want to take on and manage i know okay is it about rank is it about the fun and engagement for me theres still an element of fun and engagement and i like the decisions were making and we talk about it just now with the sacka and eak decisions these are tough decisions there are if they go wrong its big swings those are the things i like i dont like going all should i go min us a meno thats thats like doing weeks of that is gna kill my enjoyment if i get loads of points but i think it will i think you would look at around seven or eight to think about taking salah out and redistributing your funds a little bit more also the other problem with this is lewis as well at 47 if he suddenly does get dropped youre then looking at stevens and greaves coming in like a law firm doesnt it take stevens and greaves so you could you could do lewis to dunk or to or to for defender to give you that certainty or maybe you do stevens to vanderberg it is a bombsite bench absolutely but i love that theres theres not like i said unless you move the lap down to a four five and then you get in two four five defenders theres not theres not a lot of movement here in the chat triggers in the chat thats not trigger lips is it talk fba that i think it could be i think it could so we welcome were getting going very well at the moment well i take it from the badge thats him as well isnt it with the the aussie reference i know maybe its not could be and one comment i did want to i starred earlier that i thought was fantastic from greg fost just in case youre settled on that sacka transfer look at that sacka scored 28 points against spurs last season the most against any opponent there we go lets lets throw that one in there just to make you feel a little bit worried a bit more about selling fake news fake news fake well done greg love that propaganda keep that coming right should we should we hit some of the should we hit some of the super chats because we might keep going into the night we might be able to hit midnight if we keep going im so tired im just delirious so we might as well should i should i r through these stick a few on this is from flanny boy 1888 i am wild carding without harland team rated at 95 in fpl planner with be in it and point three in the blank question is should i go for a cheaper city mid and if so i can get to harland in week seven still bra not going with him now but wanting to think about how to bring him in a bit later if you didnt wild card harand now would you get him in seven or would you just try and ride it out by way thank you for the very generous super chat for i just dont see the logic in not wild carding him in now is it because you feel the team will be stronger without him for this period maybe you could create a team stronger without him for this period id like to see what it is you mean its 95 in ai and who am i to question the ai im convinced the ai is just slippers answering instant messages by the way every time takes a screenshot or sends it enough one to go send that hes building it hes hes hes the brains behind it absolutely boring theres no computer at work its just its just andy in the slippers h got i i think we looked at the capy matrix right and we looked at that run and well bring it up again now if you havent got harlem from seven to 10 where are you going with the captaincy yes youve got sacker and seven fine game week eight youve got a problem game week nine youve got a big problem so i think thats what i would fear i think youve gna if youre not going to wild card harland in now yes youve got to get him in may certainly by eight so if i go for a cheaper city mid it has to be kdb at the moment because fodens not there some genius about greish earlier maybe thats it there isnt a cheaper city mid is there rogery is like six million or 65 but you are delirious you need not well my point is youre not going to go there so youre getting de bruyne to cover harand essentially i think you just ride that if you if you think theres not going to be much in it between them which i dont agree with but if youre going without him now i think you just accept that youre probably not g have him so the same logic applies if you think that harlands not necessary now why do you need him seven thats exactly i would argue you go harand now and then you wait for foden and see what happens and then if you need to move off harland to spread funds youve got a foden to go to i would rather go to a foden than the kdb myself i would not be war carding about holland now no nor would i no so thats thats hopefully weve earn at 10 pounds i feel like we have get in touch and well pay it back to youny do dont do any of the things that youre youre suggesting copy said david james says i bloody love these pods up the borrow mid the midd fan i dont mind midd they getting on this season w first i havent looked i its criminal because i dont look at the championship now long gone its long on but i i dont mind bar and is carrick still there i think he is isnt should season last b are seventh okay thats all right the championship is so groeling i dont never want to go back there its such a hard league all dont miss it at all this is from jordan nayed hi guys bench one of gabrielle porro or lewis cant bench lewis no its its porro i would pces porro from open play i would bench porro i bench gabrielle we say it because were in pain because its a very difficult decision there not much in it is there i think theres only one team keeping the clean sheet if theres going to be a clean sheet and thats thats arsenal and so youre down to how likely is porro to get an attack in return and hes up against a good defense so cor gab i but then gabrielles on corners in a different ill go gabrielle myself over but difference of opinion thats fair enough this is from ay thank you for super chat do you start smith row at home to west ham or rogers at home to everton rogers im benching smith row currently for rogers so were on that front i smith row is not getting the full 90 yet is he still not so its just expected minutes and thats a factor plus rogers could be on pens i we joke about it but he could well be so and i think everton have conceded three goals in every game so far so everton is if youre 5050 everton is the team to target at the moment at the moment at the moment and then finally from davys family first have trent robinson johnson and barco god sorry get the blame for that theres going to be teams of barco in right to gw 38 gut punch you every week hes hes got a drop so would you do hall to pal torres or wood to pedro or rea to martinez and hall to lewis trying to remain in the clouds of overall rank 13 well done david family first well done sounds all right dont hate that r wood to pedro is interesting given my theory about would not start in but ive got the certainly wouldnt get rid of ryer halter lewis i would do halter lewis you cant you cant do halter lewis yes you can no save some money i see i wouldnt do that then right so its the first one hal to pal to pal i think thats just a youre not going to regret that are you although would to would to pedro thats a good longterm move it depends when youre when youre wild carding if youre wild carding in six i think wood to welbeck wood to welbeck you put well back in there if youre wning in six im gonna say hall toal just so i can say toow used to be one of my favorite bands thats what you get you thats what you pay for with these super chats great advice im basing it solely on the

37,FPLBlackBox,l0oClUyq9nk,FPL Wildcard? | GW4,2024-09-08T21:18:52Z,[Music] [Music] right game week three it's uh Sunday morning I'm at the end of the road Festival bit of a strange game week for me to try and kind of keep an eye on things while that music festival I've got to say um I've had about 3 hours sleep because we're camping next to what appears to be an Olympic snorer who turns in at 10: p.m. every every night um so I'm a bit delirious and um yeah I'm starting to wonder whether the sheen of music festivals is wearing off a bit I've got heartburn from the food tinitus from the music um and for I think I paid 14 quid for a duck rrap yesterday and I've been pooing in a bin for 3 Days um yeah I should qualify that the bit the toilets here are kind of like cubicles with bins below them I haven't literally been looking around for bins to put in although to be fair after the uh second hattick from Highland I did PR feel pretty feral that was a blow I've got to say I've tried not to let it affect my mood whilst being here um managed to see some of it on Match of the day last night um oh yeah I'll keep my hand in even while here and uh yeah prob excruciating but I've got I've got son and Salah today and you know one or two returns from them and everything will be all right and yeah I'm not thinking of getting him oh no no no no you know it's only regression from here surely so um maybe that's the uh lack of sleep and uh the lack of medication speaking but no not for me so yeah I'm going to be um returning home tomorrow and I'll catch up on the game then start doing the video look at some stats watch some of the matches back then so I'll I'll see you then I'm going to um go and look for another big see you a bit later so I'm back in the Civilized world back home um but that was almost a week ago in fact was a week ago and I haven't been able to film anything since because of uh the weather's been so bloody awful in fact it's pretty bad today it's damp very muddy underfoot could slip over at any moment but I thought I'd do a a quick video a bit different really because the game week review has kind of been and gone now so I thought I'd um get on camera and talk about PS my team and some of the common issues that people have got in their FBO lineups going into game week four over the international break so yeah I'm I'm still smarting from the Harland hatrick the second one of course but of course on that day Salah matched him with another 17p pointer and he's matched in 41 points to this to this stage after three game week it's quite extraordinary how the players have kind of just fitted into their brackets and scored points called only Sal and harand top tier 41 points and you've got sacka Palmer sa all kind of doing their job in their price bracket um it's probably the likes of Diaz who's kind of broken out and exceeded expectations in terms of his value more than him in a bit I'm sure so what I do about Honda am I panicking not yet the way I look at it is you know he's obviously got back toback hat tricks but sellers kept paay so that's been good my problem hasn't been not only in Harlem my problem has been the captain SE because game week one our captain Dak got Salah 10 points game week two then Captain sacka last game week and of course that's been a bit unfortunate most of the managers around me have either gone Harland or Salah the reason why it's unfortunate is because isak and sacker of opening in teams that have been reduced to 10 men with almost well more than 45 minutes to go in some cases so I've got to look at it philosophically and think that if they' have kept 11 men on the pitch both Newcastle and Arsenal could have scored more goals isak and sacka would have done better and therefore the gap between myself my team and teams with Harland captain in all three games would have been smaller so I don't think there's too much wrong on my lineup and Harland has of course been you know he's not going to keep this this hatrick a game up is he so I've got to think there's got to be some aggression we're entering a phase now where I think Salah and sacka that combo which I've got could do better than harand given the fixtur so right now yeah no Panic with Holland from [Music] me yeah so the plan will be to Captain Salo and sacka up until game week eight um I think harlander has fullham at home in game week seven which is a great fixture obviously but but sakur s Anon at home so I feel okay with that but then from game week 8 City's fixtures really look very strong and I don't know if I want to go forward without Harland at that point so that between seven and eight is where I'm looking to play the wild card and that of course is another International break so that kind of plays into the hands there so if you're not playing it between this period game week three and four game between game week 7 8 looks the next next best period because you go into a City Spring of fixtures now don't get me wrong I have looked to see if I can play it over this break obviously we're we're weak in now so I probably left it too late anyway but when I looked at it it the lineup I could get with Harland and Salah and sacka cuz I do think that's necessary more on that I'll try and cover that in a bit but I do think holding sacker is necessary that kind of wild card would give me a 4 five keeper it' give me two four five Defenders and a four million Defender and cruet it give me a 4 five attacker as my third attacker so for me I would be I'd have a very weak bench I'll be over dependent on Rogers in Midfield and I'd have to be playing a 4 five Defender and have a four million Defender as backup some weeks it's it's just too skinny for me I just don't like it so I'm going to I'm going to resist that with a view that I've got to obviously keep an eye on budget I've got to manage that very carefully but that's what I do anyway and then look to look to potentially play that wild card between game week seven and eight I will roll transfers so the way I'm thinking is it's going to one transfer this week I'll probably get e in this week then I'll hold for gameweek five make two transfers in gameweek six cuz I want to get on the brenford and Arsenal swing so I'm looking at mumo and Havoc at that point then I'll roll on game we seven and then take two into game week eight now I'll have a decision to make at that point whether I have to play the Wild Card going into game week eight in order to get on City or whether two transfers will be enough I could take a hit will I want Harland at that point or will folen be a factor fod Mar I don't know I mean there's something going on there but hopefully by going we gate foden might be in our thinking and could won't cover Harland but it give us some City cover for that good run that's the plan at the moment um but we'll see I'm certainly going to get through this break without the wild card [Music] anyway but should you wild card well it's I guess if you're leaking team value that that is going to be really annoying if you're sitting on Quan you're sitting on and kungu in particular then then perhaps it is time to make the move particularly if you don't have Trent if you don't have Robertson and you don't have a means to cover that Liverpool attack presumably a lot of you have gone Harland or Salah um obviously if you don't if you have Harland and you're trying to get to Liverpool tack you could get to Trent you could get to Robertson you could go Diaz although the intern National break could be a a worry there but obviously a lot of people are looking at selling sacka and getting to sell that way now there is Merit in that for a couple of game weeks because obviously Saka has Spurs and then he has Man City so I get it I get why people are looking at that but from game week six you're going to want to get on Arsenal there's a big Arsenal swing at that point along with a prolonged swing towards brenford to so if you're wild carding and you're losing sacka for Salah or you're forgoing any brenford assets which I imagine you will have to if you're going to try and get Harland and Salah then you've got to have a plan I think for game week six you've got to you got to be able to navigate back to some Arsenal cover and maybe get yourself a brenford asset as well because if you don't you'll be up against managers with perhaps sacka with havit as a double up ryer in goal or an ARA Defender and perhaps against managers who got in Boomer and witer that's what I plan to do that's what I'm going to move towards for game week six so if you're wild carding in this period for game week 4 and you're going Harland and Sal I get it but just think about that swing from game week six [Music] on so just round off this video a few questions that perhaps you're going to be asking yourself over this uh very International break period um first of all should you worry about players coming back from Long Haul flights etc mean obviously You' got a worry about injury that might happen whilst out International duty but traveling back is also a factor and we've seen J Pedro be a late call up to the Brazil squad weren't expecting that so that's obviously concerned because he's well owned and goes into a plummet switch fixure that we wanton him for I'll be starting him um and you know Diaz is similar very popular player playing with Columbia so he has a lot Long Haul flight I think with both those players and others traveling back what we should do is basically monitor what news we get from the clubs cuz journalists will ask about it clubs will make special you know process to try and get their players back on time to play for Saturday so I don't think it's too much for concern we do tend to overplay this kind of stuff so I wouldn't be worried yet but I certainly wouldn't move towards those players I would certainly wait and see and try and get as much information as you can [Music] what about Watkins um he's a player that I add on my long-term watch list and around about this time I was going to bring him in but obviously what we've seen so far over the three game weeks there's been lots of Mis chances but early substitutions in all three games and you know the former Jan is a concern cuz Emory knows he's got a very effective option on the bench to to take him off and rest him and and obviously there could be it seems some kind of issue here with Watkins whether it's fatigue from the Euros it's not clear um but I think we need more time before we can make a decision to bring Watkins in even though Villa's fixures are so appealing so I'm not going to move towards him if You' got him you hold him no question I think he starts whether he gets more than an hour remains to be seen so not a move to Watkins not a player I'd bring on the wild card not a player i' bring him with a transfer but certainly a whole what about Palmer another mystery around him because he hasn't been included in Chelsea's Europa conference League Squad of course which was a strange one presumably that you know it's just managing the load is is the factor behind that not on International Duty as well which I thought was a bit stranger because Lee carsley knows Palmer well he's a player that he'd want to establish in his team and Palmer obviously would want to stay St a claim for a starting roll on the carsle so that that worries me a bit more I mean both of those things for me are making me think that yeah I can afford to look elsewhere right now and that Palmer although he's incredibly attractive as an fbl asset with decent fixtures to come the urgency to move towards him isn't quite enough yet I'm sitting on son and for me I think I need to go son to e rather than son up to Palmer because e has that less fixure he has United at home and then he goes to Everton and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to keep one eye on Pala don't get me wrong but I just think there's a lot of noise around him that is W me a little bit and I need more time as I've said time and time again I need more time to assess what this moresa Chelsea is going to play like and what will come Palmer's way in terms of [Music] points so that's it for me a shorten video this week not the usual ual material so sorry about that but I had to have that time off between the festival and and now so I couldn't really look back on the game it didn't seem relevant so I thought I'd hit you a few topics there just to tide us over on this incredibly dull International break I do hate them it's absolutely awful um just a week to go before we kick off on FPL again and I can't wait for that um so we've got black box next week um so just a time stamp this this is Sunday Sunday afternoon so in a few days time we'll be prepping for the next episode of blackbox we'll be looking forward to game week four we'll have obviously we'll go into depth from some of the things I spoke about in this video but that's it for me now um I'll see you soon see you on blackbox in the week don't forget to subscribe to the channel and hit the like if you enjoy this video see you next [Music] [Music] time oh jesz,2607,right game week three its sunday morning im at the end of the road festival bit of a strange game week for me to try and keep an eye on things while that music festival ive got to say ive had about 3 hours sleep because were camping next to what appears to be an olympic snorer who turns in at 10 pm every night so im a bit delirious and im starting to wonder whether the sheen of music festivals is wearing off a bit ive got heartburn from the food tinitus from the music and for i think i paid 14 quid for a duck rrap yesterday and ive been pooing in a bin for 3 days i should qualify that the bit the toilets here are like cubicles with bins below them i havent been looking around for bins to put in although to be fair after the second hattick from highland i did pr feel pretty feral that was a blow ive got to say ive tried not to let it affect my mood whilst being here managed to see some of it on match of the day last night ill keep my hand in even while here and prob excruciating but ive got ive got son and salah today and one or two returns from them and everything will be all right and im not thinking of getting him no its only regression from here surely so maybe thats the lack of sleep and the lack of medication speaking but no not for me so im going to be returning home tomorrow and ill catch up on the game then start doing the video look at some stats watch some of the matches back then so ill ill see you then im going to go and look for another big see you a bit later so im back in the civilized world back home but that was almost a
