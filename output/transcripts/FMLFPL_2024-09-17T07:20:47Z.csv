support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay were going to von this walsh how we doing much more somber watch this episode but we i sm moving along im always smiling its just its sm i either smile cuz its smile or im smile to hold back the tears this is one of those but i was thinking about our both of us on fat reds and i was just like this is the week were getting tested like this is can we hold our nerve can we keep our good players like yada y yada or are you you got im on 200k i didnt expect it to be honest but i think its just like my scattered onep pointers isach off at half nico didnt start and hendo just the actual worst pick in the game worst player in the league i would have thought for you at 51 would have just treaded water because of how poor everyone else did besides captain holland but i thought so everyones also still at this early stage so bunched up point total wise that every few points is like a huge amount of i bet you im like 10 points away from like 150k crazy like that well how many 10 points is a lot 40 no im i know your week was bad your overall points 300 301 i know so 301 so youre 11 or 12 higher than me and youre probably what 300000 places im 180k youre 35000 places ahead of me 10 points is a huge amount of points so 51 bad job by me after mentioned dean hendo this guy 2141 palace defense complete mess disaster every game yep onep pointer por0 2 nico doesnt start i had i had 10 men ian how nico played 10 minutes so thats the equivalent of 10 men for me every point counted this week you had 10 men but i had like the one pointers got the pen didnt take it did he get the pen didnt get that gordon blank mo the eso situation i was running a sausage fest in the park no ones going to know what the im talking about but i was running orders i checked my phone walsh just like eso subed at half like what the vision blurred hes probably concuss i dont even know the bloody nose doesnt make your vision blurry but it was bad the real worry for me now is i transferred in j pedro hes knocked herzler is a fraud were not going to know anything unless he plays in the cup game esos heard eddies a fraud were not going to know anything barcos not in the premier league and sunar is hurt and im sitting here have two frees i was planning on completely chilling until my wild card in six now its like i havent popped anything i havent touched a thing can never tell with you no and sometimes you sometimes you throw it on me on the pod like its happened before thats true its happened happen before im trying to find pod boys wheres the pod boys leag we need to spend some time looking at your your team thatll be more a thursday thing but well it cant be a thursday thing if youre wild carding you got to do it thats got to be a now thing its true i already missed two rounds of price changes but who cares i certainly dont unless if youre avoiding drops like which i dont know maybe you did have a drop but double price like thats not a thing anymore like double triple price risers like that just doesnt happen they diddle it too hard and they have their finger on the scale too hard its its still like you cant possibly lead you cant point to anything other than salani to indicate how fraudulent this game is right what he went down once or not even he has not price changed he got hes had like 2m sales and he hasnt price changed they just mispriced him because or they mispriced him conceivably if he was on spurs so theyre just like were just not going to price change were not going to change his price gaming two thats what it is 855000 transfers out gaming 3 800000 transfers out g mc four 350000 transfers out no price change no price change so thats why they dont tell us the formula cuz there isnt one and they just do whatever they want and they make a mistake accurate so team walshire not good not a good week not good another week without holland tough i it was nothing if not a mistake to take holland out of my team i think we 100 know yet until this game and next game where theyre the only two weeks of the season where he maybe wont be the number one cat thats a zero percenter because hes already on he has more goals than any team in the league the last two weeks hes on 60 points cuz its double cap on both weeks and its so its i got away max absolute max punish i got away with it last week because i happened to get points elsewhere and mo equal him but didnt happen this week not by a long shot mo was invisible washed version of himself he was and everyone was terrible the only returns i got were olly and rya everyone else was a one a triple onep pointer in defense with trent lewis and robo and then i had just blanks everywhere else it was just unbelievable carnage and yet youre still 180k its just the thing where it feels so bad is that i used all my chips and then and i talked a few moments ago that everyones bunched up but it just feels so bad to like give it all back right away almost like this week thats what it feels like you thats why i said at the beginning like this is the week thats going to test us the next two weeks like i have your team is still good holland is not the best cap and well see how it goes but thats where it is for me is like this week the best can hope for is going back to where i was last week so like thats how im my sights are angled as like the best case scenar and thats just bad like thats a bad job so you had an 8m gaming crank its not high not high not high but i think overall things are mostly fine the right did right i think im going to have to defer the league updates cuz didnt do them it all right dude game week five onto game week five but what are we talking about from last week where do you want i want to start i think e is the biggest talking point god dude that how disgusting was that it was i was so el gut punch i was just so elated for me like 75 seconds between the pen and then watching bald huge tuck in shirt i transferred in pedro and e and im like ah pedro doesnt not even in the squad hurz fraud blah as a saves the day here it comes max bones easy me us so mish said do we hold as an hope heim said is mata stri does he make it into the three best forwards on the wild card over watkins or kai jb is muno is an immediate cell hes wild carding six but still maybe immediate cell and fering said our palace now just a large garbage barge that should be fire sold well there are mean these are all palace question but where do you stand with as we didnt know ahead of the game but glasner said we have mata and as two pen takers and then he lets them sorted on the field where do you stand more annoying that he said that way more annoying i agree gives us more one theyll take turns the trepidation of saka odard handing each other pens because theyre friends like that situation but its hard to its hard to like rank how much of a downgrade it is if what like all i know is its a big downgrade cuz he just got from saturday till now he just got minus five goals on the season you just subtract five random 10point hauls from the season and thats bad that makes him from a great auto pick to hes an okay pick the fixtures arent good home man united away everton might be good but who knows when bran is coming back home liverpool at forest home spurs i its just not good you this is not a player that you would bring in for this fixture run if you knew ahead of time he wasnt on pence and now we have him and were just like im not even sure this is a good pick so thats where im at hes never going to be a bad pick because hes still a good player but hes a bad pick hes just not best pick like in what universe would you buy him from this point forward there isnt one i think it would have to be a real good fixture on thats what i was trying to say maybe 10 through 14 at wolves home fulham at villa home newcastle at ips switch or 18 through 25 whatever point stands you would never buy him for the run that hes currently on and yet here we are with him its it feels horrible dude its terrible i wait it feels like i just lit a free transfer well two free transfers on absolute fire also that he had the goal gami one rolled out cuz of the ref thing y and then this one like youre looking at he could be on 40 30 to whatever 30 something points top four mid in the game he could be it could be mo diad saka as right now easily and its like these are just hes just a beta and thats what were seeing before our eyes i know put fo down thats whats going on here so i dont want him i feel like im going to get rid of him as soon as i possibly can im going to keep him this week because im im saving for sure but he still has avenues hes still hes still classy he still shoots a lot but this is just the power of pens where its like we have a bizarre layout of our fixtures where we dont have a good fixture window at any point this season which happens to some teams sometimes like there isnt think the run i laid out is good enough i dont i dont i dont agree cuz youre looking at some tough ways and f are always a tough game if switches it but then youre looking a five i dont think fulhams good i think villas pretty poor newcastle we dont know what theyre going to look like in november regardless a team like us like a good fix run youre looking at you want in a six game five or six game week window like multiple home games with home in way of the promoted sides and like we just dont have that maybe things will change but just looking at it now and when you dont have that the pens are the things that buoy him to be feeling like in your head as like an elevated pick where okay well theres a bad one theres a good one theres a medium one theres a good one theres a medium one doesnt matter we went a pen ne all neckti was doing the whole game was diving like were going to win probably seven pens this year between e and him and like thats what were going to do and maybe two maybe hell take two so youre subtracting 40 points from his total so hes going from knocking on 190 to being like 150 and thats just not a pick i think a lot of people listening to this probably are thinking like were overreacting hes still good p but heres another way to put it imagine a world where bumo is not on pens what are we talking about no ones transferring him in i hes on the 15th best team at best in the league and theyre they barely score and all they do is set piece and throw in play like im good easy pass on bumo and yet im sitting here its ging five theyre at spurs and im like i cant believe i dont have buma on my team like im a idiot for not having boomo on my team especially with the way the bonus points are this year it seems like if you score a goal youre at least get an a bonus point if not all of them so as its just its just unfortunate very unfortunate i have a note a little note in my phone going this week and after that moment i had to start it in my this is how i get my frustration out i was like who takes every box because e just got removed from that list and the list is very short players its bumo its bruno palmer i dont i dont think brunos on the list honestly his open play threat is too low for me decreased so saka bumo palmer and then the one cheap guy that no one talks about except for me and pre mgw no yes no every box is ticked hes also like just he doesnt shoot he shoots sometimes he shoots enough maybe once a game no he shoot he shoots more than that but im not with you on mg i feel like weve reversed roles with mgw where i had him on wolves before they transferred him to like the flamp and he was like removing im good at that i do that every year youve done that multiple times but he plays deep he doesnt shoot hes not on set pieces anymore hes not on set pieces anymore so hes youre right youre right we dont also we dont know he depends like you could show me wood taking the next like this could bea they only won one pen they only won one pen last year because theyre wolves and he took it but wood wasnt on the pitch okay im moving him so its sakaba palmer thats it from the midfielders from anyone any forward midfielder defender everyone in the game those are the only players who take every box i think its a little bit unfair to compare that i think like the set piece situation just because strikers dont take set pieces like i think they have to be removed in that okay but its a its a box for me though thats why midfielders are better and score more points thats son hes almost definitely on pens i dont think he takes corners doing mats doing it and some idiot you could argue for that but also were not 100 trees on pens also thats true it could be dom right youre saying could be dom it hes a the season okay so hes off corners which is probably good to conserve his energy cuz there was a time when he was i remember he was like taking a lot of corners and he was he getting some cheeky assist he took 150 corners in 21 season but i think its those three guys are the only ones who tick every box and that means like open play goal threat open play assist threat set pieces pens corners mos not on set pieces ind indirect right its just that avenues i was talking about the avenues last pod right or maybe that was the thursday half the corners but its corners is pretty good about like trent right like you dont consider clean sheets an avenue but he would be on zero points if clean sheets werent an avenue right and he got three clean even though everyone missed his chances so its just its just something i was looking at removed as he off hes off its such a nightmare maybe it should just be not you have to be on corners or you have to be on set pieces but combined like you take enough dead balls that its like a it should be like a number i can easily make this like a chart where its like you have to pass these thresholds well its also like ranking the value of the set pieces direct fre direct free kicks are the most valuable indirect set pieces from like elbow range and then corners last so those are probably similar like the corner crosses to sorry corner cross to like an elbow cross im sure theyre like not that different but what its just something interesting so definitely but what about mata is he now just like a this equally makes him a much better pick because he just added five goals right so thats alarming in a good way right hes a pick hes a pick for sure he was already flirting with pick status and now look weve had a tumultuous couple months here and now that we have the squad that we have i feel like glar is going to be able to get and we have lowkey had a lot of changes like a lot of changes last year so many changes its in the engine room its at center back its its at wing its like almost every area of the team has been bad job that it all happened in the last week of the window except alis like it just its this team does not know each other it happened its done with and now here we are today so i do think that we will continue to improve if the season progresses and mateta 75 just good ne ti is good we have good players were going to keep playing better and i think that were going to be in good shape in about a month or so also i just i dont know what the hell gay hes up to but watching those highlights and hes been sniffing glue i think hes huffing nitrous before every game as a warmup and its like he just looks like hes 45 years old cant turn cant run all his touches are bad im like what is this guy is so good and now hes bad i dont know whats happening he looks like he needs a few weeks off honestly which i also no its not coming i also think that theres a lot more responsibility on his shoulders with anderson gone like i think anderson was more like ar like like van d like telling everyone where the theyre supposed to be and now i think thats falling gay like set the line and do all that and hes playing with fuing seltzer on his and kle on his right and its like what the is this if you have to compensate for playing with kleene anyones going to look bad playing next to klein behind pressure so weve got and like munoz right mentioning earlier its the defense is just not there at all so you just shouldnt you shouldnt have the defenders lroy just came in and its its going to take some time y okay speaking of palmer because we did get two palmer questions and mishka said deep analysis of the chelsea game what did you learn should expectations for what should expectations for palmer be and then he lists all his stats which were bad and then elon said any concerns about palmer im thinking of using him as a cash cow next week so what is he a couple weeks removed from a 50p pointer and he had a 17p pointer six pointer one blank and now everyones selling whats happening its its an overreaction but i think there are some mning signs that are worth taking note they hes just peripheral in a lot of a lot of as was in that game and its wolves i think are well come on to wolves when we talk about wolves later but outside of that like it seems like the enemy is just okay lets mark him and take him out of the game and then well deal with the rest and hes not getting into threatening position so much and hes doing a lot of his work around the edges and in peripheral areas of the pitch and its he has a lot of avenues as you mentioned previously with the pens and the all the other all the other bits there hes expensive and when they make three attacking subs every game and its three strangers for three strangers and they play on thursday all year its like what does this team jelling look like and when it does gel whos taking the shots its its probably not going to be palmer that much its almost to me i feel like hes going to turn into like oil where hes like look last year he got 10 penalty goals and he did score a lot of beautiful goals and im im probably going a little too hyperbolic in terms of like decreasing palmers goal output or potential but last year he scored 22 that will be his career high i feel like i would bet any amount of money that he will never score more than 22 league goals in his career no one gets 10 pens a game like it happens one time ever and his shot his just his shot out outputs not there to level what you need an open play period so what where do his points come from the assists are nice but the change of the bonus system deflates the value of those there arent 6 point assist goal scorers getting six point assists arent a thing anymore so where does he land probably still hit somewhere in the 180 200 range but is he just like a hold forever im not sure i know last week were looking at it and saying okay hes just underpriced still and he still might be but im just trying to look at it a little bit more like how does it go wrong and i can see how thats it like thats where i where what i was watching on the bournemouth game right for me the biggest takeaway from that game wasnt necessarily like palmer might be a bad pick its bournemouth is just not a great fixture b they everything up they press you to death they up your buildup they win a lot of their battles aial monsters they win their battles theyre physical they they just kick the out of palmer thats what they did you want to progress the bot of palmer were going to foul him every single time and or two men in front of him and he cant like he just couldnt get the ball from that like right space to the center and he couldnt find space couldnt find any space ever and like you said well get to them later i think that like the cap this week maybe thats where we should go next but and weve seen a bunch of bournemouth games now and they have not had good fixtures right like evertons good but like now we think more highly of nfo home newcastles not easy to completely shut them down and they completely battered the out of the better they were better than them by a l they were better than chelsea too they miss a pen lose one nil but they were just better so that was my bigger takeaway i was looking at like some of their stats and stuff their third lowest buildup percentage against first by a very large margin in league in high turnover they missed the pen thats what im saying so theres going to be teams that are like the top best buildup teams in the league like we would think of like desery brighton hes not there anymore city arsenal dont know if liverpool are like big tbd they havent played like a great pressing team at all yet so well see if they can bust through but im with you right now if i had oly i would be captaining oly but circling back im with im agree with you completely on the bouth standpoint we have to we have to update our how we look at them completely and comprehensively i think going back to the polymer situation its you hes again with the a hes never going to be a bad pick like hes hes going to get returns hes going to get points hes too good but i definitely think that if you need money you can look there like i dont think thats egregious and hes not in hes not in that many teams and like do i want polymer in medium fixtures when i could have saka in good fixtures no not close do i want to have saka and bad fixtures when palmer has good fixtures no i probably want to go back to palmer like the way that season has shaped so far is like theres one mustone and his names holland and then like between mo saka palmer maybe even sun well see were going to rotate like its hard to say now its only been five game four games but it seems like were going to rotate these guys based on fixtures which seems right to me right now but i wouldnt be worried with him like you said never a bad pick has all the avenues one of three players who ticks every box hes gonna get pen theyre not gonna get no pens and the one nice thing too with him compared to the other premium assets is hes not even in the europe squad so while they play its going its going to affect their preparation and the cohesiveness and the rhythm of the squad because he plays four new player every game is ridiculous but this international break players injured thats fine but it just it does feel that way that it will be disjointed throughout the season but for palmer hes going to play 90 every game in the league so thats also a huge boon to his value which we cant say about even mo we cant say that about everyone none of the pre premiums well i assume spurs are not in europe right theyre in something arent they are they i dont even know man let me are they in conference league or whatever i think so europa league europa league all right so they have thursday carag so even son i dont know maybe hell rest them but well we teased the captaincy i me we havent individually talked about liverpool or villa yet but we could start with cap and then go to either one of them but big daddy said toala still the best captain this week or weve seen enough against forest to second guess aie is there anyone you like for captain at all if you dont have mo and then benett jitterbug also discussing mo versus oyap all the same its hard to answer this before the midweeks because like what would you need to see well like what would change your mind do you think because for me i dont think the midweeks matter that much play mo doesnt play allie plays doesnt so worst case is like ali starts mo doesnt start mm then what oe its like they both play on tuesday like they both have like ample time off before the game like i just dont think it matters ali this maybe is going to be a recurring thing with him his slow starts he missed every chance imaginable in the first three games then he blows up with 13p pointer maybe hes going to be good for the rest of the season like he was last season but we know his fitness is like once hes fit hes a beast like ive never seen him not sprinting so im not that worried about that i wonder what was bothering him there was an emory thing that said like he came back with like a little niggle but what niggle would one have that they would still start and play an hour like what is that its so confusing could be anything it could be his should like i it could be anything just little pain here like whatever its it would be it doesnt matter than midweek its to me it is definitely oi because bournemouth are legitimately a good team and wolves are a joke like i think wolves are second to sorry southampton to best attacking fixture in the league based on how theyre playing this year thats just how i see it thats how ive seen them play all season and they dont have the personnel to do anything different like they cant park a bus they have such bad defenders and they have no midfield like mario lamina i dont even know if hes a defensive midfield i dont know what he is but they just dont have any like no i love him but im just saying they dont have like dms to play like he seems like hes just doing this thing and hes going to be doing it all year no matter what and theyre just so open theyre just so open am i crazy or like were they not playing three at the back for like large majority of last season and just got three dudes in there who headed out they played like at least by fb ref which isnt perfect they from november on played three at the back in every game thats when they were playing three at the with like eight nor was playing wing like those games and but this year theyre just playing for the back just expensive thats going to be good neither of them can do anything theyre bad tomato and anori defensively are not good well tomatos pretty good defensively i think but fast but no thats what im saying its just theyre just playing this open theres so much space on the pitch every game ive seen them play this year and its their i me i think this is like theyre very exploitable i think its a lot the gambling people were on them as like theyre the team that could get dragged into a relegation race like there were good odds on them like they compared to the odds because everyone just has all the promoted sides straight back down i wish they had saw in that i will say that but saw potenti for sure and johnson stole some points from me as a eso gordon owner there was like a eso played murphy and clean through johnson save there were a couple other like could got something there so hell do that but im born with are just good mo i think i think the fixture is not close enough which is also aggravating because i dont if i didnt go the main reason why i wanted to get mo on wild card was for this week and im like ah just whatever its fine thats f thats what thats why i have those stats like ready to go for bournemouth because i watched the match and then like today i watch highlights of all the matches and whatever and i was just like dude what and then i was trying to just like put numbers to it i was like what are they like doing like why is this working highlights will never show you any of this but they just they just break everything up they just are a pest and ariel good they also just have so many high energy like chrisy like all of their guys just run an insane amount taver seeno they all fullback also never go forward they challenge you and stick to you and valou you and then they just go long thats the other thing when they attack theyre not southampton theres no opportunity to like win the ball and get a chance they just go long to their huge guys to s meno he win every du its just like go deal with him off its nowhere near our goal ever the one other i we also didnt know sancho looked unbelievable there could be something there could there could be something there look netto good player doesnt fit what they do at all i so i dont know what how thats going to end its not going to go well for him is how im imagining plan of this team everyone knows is ridiculous there is no plan buto might just be banished already like i would not be surprised enzo said like he doesnt care about the other guys he likes keeping a small team like it might just be or he just plays on thursday i just mean like from prem but sancho is interesting especially from a palmer standpoint where he just never wants to shoot all he wants to do is facilitate so i like that i like that he could potentially take a step forward and get in the team well s is the same which is weird and funny right its just like you get saner the ball let him dribble a little bit hell create he also doesnt cu youre saying thats what palmers like too i feel like palmer likes to shoot though he shoots he likes to shoot but maybe hes insted not to sancho keep an eye on him man utd could use him they could they should buy someone like thatd be good so olly more questions about olly and just other forwards i just group these all together people with c and isach do we kneejerk to mata and oly or play it cool bolter said in previous seasons i would punt on oli transfer sock out even though im wild carding in six which is something we talked about on the last sp of just like the interesting decision that we have now with the five transfers and rolling the freeze i we can just start there the other ones are about other forwards where do you see that like using a free lets just say use bol as example use a free es to ali even though im wild carding and get in6 so youre like burning a free for one punt one weak punt but youre going to wild card and have one or two or three free well its not a onewe punt its a two we punt because youre captaining him so you get double so i think i like that thinking i like that thinking i would definitely do that definitely cap bali bring him in for sure any other thing you tell me i would not say sign off on that one we move but what this is like touching on both of our team where are you at with eso and also not having ali like how do you see this cookie crumbling or it just feels ridiculously stupid to not have olli right now is it just for this week cuz its wolves and the holland thing or is it just like for the next its wolves ip switch its like the next two and that was i had like a plan at some point that like im gonna get oli but i got scared off it because he played 60 minutes every game and was missing every chance he finally came good so good for everyone who has but if isach wasnt hur lets just say newcastle still win that game isach probably gets a return if hes on the pitch i would probably just suck it up and just be like ah just going to stick with it hold my free like its sets me up better long term but with eso hurt probably can cuss im no doctor but again the vision blurry thing is a little concerning it seems worth it does it matter to how many freeze the persons on because i do think thats a factor you have three or one or whatever because if you have one and you make this one move and you wild card then youre just going to have one after wild card and you better have done a lot of your picks right cuz if not like thats a little youre in the normal season like scary i think in terms of doing the move it doesnt matter cuz i think having oi captain compared to mo or anybody else is enough of a edge i think where it comes around is how aggressively can you plan your transfers with your wild card if you have one versus three or four right because like were going into this the bad city and arsenal so how many of them do you have to stash like probably more so you might have to go a little thin on the edges on your wild card and or wait no cuz if youre doing it now you dont have it for this week right no its for this week g in six we have wild card up so i dont think it matter im mixed up im thinking if youre doing it now youre good i dont think it matters i think because when you do it in six youre getting the arsenal players youre doing the things like its easier to make a six team than it is to make a five team but the only part that makes it weird and its hard to talk about specific teams because everyones in a different situation but like with andy on our live stream right it came down to like dude you should just rip wild card on the last day of an intern naal break to save your transfers which is where i am and the fact that i might have to wild card is like if i dont get any ja pedro update no eso update theyre both fraudulent managers who arent going to say anything anyway but im sitting here with a team with like two maybe not players nico who might not start barcos not the league soar i could use my two freeze right i could like double change get alli cap oy whatever but then im on no freeze versus i could just wildc card have two frees afterwards and im in probably a better spot yep so i dont know i dont know what people should do with that information its like maybe if you can just use one you do it but if its more wild card early its the contextual nature matters here but i think some of the same processing of how should i be looking at this applies its its tough its tough call its an interesting call when were we keep talking about this how much more fun the game is with this rule change just adds so much more complexity and so much more thought behind its not just dead end cuz you lose it or whatever it just makes the game a lot more interesting because this would be in a previous season this would not even be a decision of course use your free before your wild card you have to or you burn it free you just do its like almost a m youre automaton so what about dcl great p ever since we declared the error hes come back with the vengeance with his bullet 12 last two all i was saying on lr pot is dcs a pick mcneels a pick look at that hall i cant believe they went up two again and blew it again though cant you absolute house team but i think theyre picks theyre still picks mcneils 54 ds 59 hard to find guys in that price range who are better look we talk about d celia pens and why is mcneel a pick just run this through again for me because hes never been a pick since hes been in the league which has been for seven years i think its just more a long run of good pictures and mcneel is this rare weird who theres probably others in the league maybe like kevin falls into this category but probably not because of like doku and b and whatever but if theres a chance hes assisting it he creates every chance imaginable for their team and theres theres just not its like the talisman but for assists because all their chances are like get the ball to mcneel cross set piece mcneel cross free kick mcne cross and he sometimes shoots and scores world e and whatever but like its just are they going to score goals are everton going to be fine i still think theyre gna be completely fine once they get guys fit so do i dice just too good and like so i still theyre going to score goal they just scored two against villa theyre going to score goals in this run of easy fixtures and hes gonna rack on the assist in this stretch thats it and hes 54 its its just free real estate sisers bournemouth who we just aformentioned best team in the league bournemouth we just talked about and then he halls as for villa easy and now he has a whats the run atlas or home palace home at ep home fham at south at west home brenford at m united home wolves before ar its insane im sure theyre knocked out of every cup already it they dont they dont have a lot of other things to focus mcneil they dont even have the luxury of focusing on anything else because theyll get relegated if they do they have to win games so go back over to dcl where is dcl le frogging ladro here cuz he is to me a million times yes is not even plan the run is not even its night and day hes a legit good pick the problem is we only have three forward slots and theres him theres kai theres ali theres holland theres dom theres theres other guys who will emerge too but he is a good pick i think that like i havent played with the wild card team for now but like theres a good chance yet but theres a good chance that like if i need an enabler 59 good nail 90 every game depends the only thing he cant do is being a oneonone but thats okay well get well get over that could be i dont know other forwards though people are asking aie said what are your thoughts on kai after this next game we easy hold or do we try and get saka instead and mish said is it dom time salani time again lot of forward action im uninterested in salanki should we talk about spurs arsenal now sure theyre theyre doing the same thing that they did last year and its just nothings changed and he just showed up so they have thursday they have a pretty good run of fixtures but its a good time for them if i if i were a wild card now its like i could they have one bad fixture until christmas at city in november 20 third gaming 12 every other fixture is pretty its a crazy run its a kind it is a crazy run but i think the p like this is similar to e its like the pens are just such a huge deal to look at him well i just feel like im operating under the assumption that the captain and player who has not missed pens for them over the last couple years will take pens still and its son i agree hes probably like one of their highest ever goal scorers also like hes the guy me operating under this pretext that hes not on pens its just i dont see him beating out these other players that were mentioning for a spot like i just dont see how hes shouldering past any of them in the pecking order if he had pens i think hed be in hed be in hed be in the top three but as it stands i think hes just on the outside looking in and it is its interest im like so sun just cooks my head so much all the time cuz ive had such an up and down relationship with him fpl wise over the years like some years its amazing and some years its awful and i was pretty like out on him at the end of last year just like this player is not good anymore and still i look at the run and i just think like hes playing he a couple braces right like thats all it is its like hes going to blank and then he just pops up with a brace and its like son classic 10 isnt a good price and the brace had against everton was very fortuitous i think it was pretty lucky but and then hes been invisible for the other three games and hes going to play as long as hes fit hes starting every hes just going to keep starting they dont have the team is like its his team so im im a little bit interested in sun i dont know if i would pull the trigger and put him in my team but he thats like a wild card pick potentially not like someone youre necessarily transferring right it feels like you use your transfer on like higher impact like people want mo this week people want saka next week or oli this week whatever like guys you might captain and stuff oli sun just feels like if i wild card i could find a way that hes in my team and like i feel like no one has him like theres no way any has him youd have to be insane to have him hes he looks like a terrible pick hes been playing badly and like the team is per owned and theres millions of koreans in the world so you have to factor that in hes negative per owned if you fact that they dont all look the same though as his teammate will bon core who played through it with the cor he played through that a difficult take of his but jesus christ spurs ah man they are so frustrating to watch and theyre just like theyre southampton on steroids like theyre just like were going to dominate the game but also never create a good chance ever like i was i was talk i think i was at the end of last stream i was talking with jack lad about bruno and how there was that one did you listen to the anfield rap when neil did the solo show the trends he was by himself i dont think ive ever heard it was that like this week it was a couple weeks ago okay definitely didnt hear that then so it was like a solo show was just him talking it was like a half an hour and he went app like he left his body talking about man united and bruno not bruno just talking about man united and just how long theyve been so b like how bad theyve been for how long not only based on like the public perception but also just the numbers like how bad theyve been genuinely how bad theyve been and it got me thinking i always listen with the fpl lens on about bruno just like hes 85 and hes bad like if bumo was 85 wed be wed be like like okay like its i would still immediately get him but like its just like thinking about where is bruno at compared to the other midfielders like hes not 85 he should be he should be seven like he should be the same price as buo like their attack is the same as brenham and he doesnt even play striker hes living off this previous reputation of his first year or two under ol and where they were attacking out of control they got a couple extra pens than they typically do and like he banged in these huge years but but its similar to me thinking about spurs where its like why is there all this price inflation on a team that to me when i watch them just feels mid like their attack looks midt like it looks just as good as all the midt teams it doesnt look top four it doesnt look top six like why would i spend 10m on anyone on their team like they dont perform to that level at all and like its back with sun is like living on previous reputation i know he just had 200 points last year but i think theres a lot of m striker though thats a different yes double dig of his goals were at striker and play striker no other comps like a lot over as xg as he normally does you still have to mention that and so i just look at this team and im like theres so many more reasons why i against son than for him and but i still like a moth to flame im like son like same honestly if man united had nine good fixtures in a row i would be the i would also in a world where im like maybe wild card id be like maybe i just hold bruno for nine and hope he gets two pens and two assists and one open play goal and im like thats good that would be amazing if you got thats too bad they already played southampton so they got their free win out of the way but all that to say that game was just like i dont know what game it was a noname nothing happened arsenal were very happy with nothing happening and then saka one of three players who takes every box ticked one of his boxes and gets a assist he scored a corner im starting to get a little bit i know that with arsenal were looking at them having some injuries so things are a little bit difficult there but missing a lot they played four games theyve scored six goals not a lot of goals im starting to look back at is this just going to be the most conservative pep team weve ever seen and they set out to keep it nil as long as possible thinking theyre going to just fall into the off the set piece or thea moment of brilliance because they dont commit men they dont gamble they dont do much of anything they just stay in control and command and should we be like were looking at like kai saka like home ler home southampton do you think its been because its been the start of the season this little first three game we thing and then injuries and theyre going to score five and six sometimes or is this going to be they play every three games hard to say the schedules been hard hard home wolves they were not great but they scored two and just killed the game a away villa they were bad and scored two goals and killed the game brighton they piled on the most attack ive seen from them all season i feel like they created like many good chances even in the first half at 11v 11 and then down to man they kept racking up even more chances on the break with ken saka so that was almost the most encouraging attacking performance but then no rice no ode but also i think like and this is like a larger point that i had in my notes is just like everyone played bad after the international break every team that was favored by a goal or more you either lost that bet or push that bet they all city could have been down 30 they come back and win 21 on weird goals liverpool lose to forest palace were one of them they 22 bright were one of them they nil they lost nil villa are the only one that pushed every other bet lost villa were down two nil and theyre the only one that pushed well man united but but they were not they were not favored by that much because theyre united and they also could have been down one nil and that should have been down one n everyone just came back sleepy and theyre missing rice and theyre missing odard i dont know i feel like it was almost just him being like well first of all like this is maybe practice for etad like we just need to sit on it take our chances play smart play control nil prepare for the nil but then also i just think home luster home southampton its like they cant not score i just think theyre going to be parked in the attacking third the entire game in both of those thats fair but its not been encouraging and we havent even talked about liverpool lose one nil dont even reach one xg at home another just like flat performance of all these teams after the international break and its just like what do you do i grouped newcastle and liverpool separately from the others because both of them were liverpools the best attack in the league last year newcastle were fifth best by the numbers last year they both like liverpool gets zero goals newcastle somehow get two goals right its like a sh worldy deflection barnes worldy they had a couple other chances but it what didnt feel like a two goal game and yet im like they had like liverpool specifically they were just in the final third the whole game all day in transition whole game huge chance missplay pass huge cutback chance missplay pass so its hard to quantify it because its like either you believe nfo is not this good in their defense isnt this good or you believe liverpool arent that good and the first three games were like an anomaly or what am i led to believe here i think liverpool we both think theyll be on track theyll be fine it was a weird bad game newcastle have been weird bad start to the season but again like space everywhere all the time just missing on the execution post missing things and its it was a bad day in the office for liverpool and bad days in the office typically happen when youre away from your colleagues for two weeks and youre working another job with new colleagues for two weeks its like thats what it is its up and all of the things can be true right nfl could have played well and gotten a little lucky a little rub of the green and limited the things and but i think the infrastructure and the way liverpool have looked the first three give us a little bit more than just thinking that theres something broken here im not there with newcastle though i think its more of like im still panicking about them i think that they look i was we were i think you were off but in discord just look like theyre fourth place theyve been probably the worst team in every single of their four games they played actual like they were definitely in the first one down to 10 men definitely i thought they were i thought they were better they had some counter dominated in the way that to do they did the thing and but like wolves could have beaten them 40 and i would been like thats what i watched i didnt watch that match and i was i was stunned when i looked at the numbers and watch the highlights cuz you were texting me like wolves had a million chances could have been 40 but like in the numbers and the highlights it just was not bad they had like they had the one tap in that was great and other than that it was like just a couple like mid tier chances so surpris what you were seeing you need to watch it like i dont know the numbers are the numbers but there were so many times where there was like a good move where there was some type of lopsided situation going on and then one of their bad players which is like nine of them like did something stupid or strand whatever it is but by and large like they were just winning every oneonone like it was just are just lets go one on lets go one verse one everywhere on the pitch and they just beat them everywhere on the pitch pretty much the whole game you dont need to talk me out of newcastle defense ive been so selling on them for like six months and i feel like this game just like reemphasize that point but where its hard with newcastle attack again its like i feel like im like making excuses for their attack every week but its also not wrong right its like gorans still creating chances still hitting the post still look ey test good esos like creating some chances bub gets concussed okay like me bad luck or whatever they created some big chances late in the game when it was even more open tanali and barnes had big chances and i think the manager is terrible been on that record for years and hes just playing long staff they have a couple of players that are so they have a couple of players that are completely incompetent that ruin everything and like even to the point where i look at the defense and im like why the actual his trips not starting again like we couldnt sell him the turkey like comes in for 30 minutes creates chances go back to the thing that worked like put all the tall guys in the back three and let him play wing and do that and the field and you love to talk about a stench we have not mentioned this eddie how and the tind director of football not tindle do about that they like dont they dont they like weeks like the whatever is it mitchell or some like hes like the transfers have all been bad and then eddie has to like come out to the press and defend the play i like all the players we brought in its like what the is going on they need the evil robot saudi woman well shes gone i know that they need it there is it doesnt sound or smell good and and its also right hes this is what the criticism ive had of edward for years is like he picks the worst players like he picks the worst possible team with the squad he has available almost all the time he finally starts playing barnes and then he drops him and then he start starts playing hall and then he has to drop hall for kelly puts i cant play barnes and hall i cant play barnes and hall its just so stupid like hes so stupid and bad and dumb and he does such dumb every week i cannot handle the person and the teams a mess theyve won three and drawn one and yet it still feels like hes on the ropes cuz mitchells mitchells got a hard on to get rid of them he cant wait to fire him hell fire him the first notice he gets that hes allowed to fire him hes going a fire him i know and i know i think they need to fire him how far are they going with theyve already hit the heights with edward it was a couple years ago theres no upside here like this is they could i did forget to bring this up when you were talking about spurs and how theyre just like midtable i was thinking about it earlier i was like whos the fourth best team cuz i think that is very not obvious cuz it could be spurs could be chelsea could be newcastle could be villa are there i think i think villa i think its villa theyre okay im not like buying stock and them finishing fourth at all i would i would buy bright no thats come on thats insane i would buy i think its crazy i would buy the villa stock i think chelsea are also reasonable just because of the she the sheer quality of players that they have at every position is like you and i could comanage like edward tindall style and i think we would do pretty well with chelsea we do pretty well with this chelsea squad like its just they have 100 play 100 pound players and 50m pound player backups at like every spot onam play mostly well the win against bournemouth was scam but like they beat the out of palace which ended 11 and they scored six goals against wolves and they played okay against city for enzzos first match they played fine the thing with villa look europe could destroy them i do hope that that eings is able to manage the squad and players like barkley and are going to be advantageous for them in that regard bia andan and i just the biggest thing with me for them is duran like having another striker that can clearly score goals is something that all of these teams in the fourth place conversation that were discussing dont have and you can make maybe the ar spurs but chelsea and maybe spurs to some extent with rich but hes never available so i dont know if that even counts not the argument for spurs would be like its dom and then move sua striker is like the backup chelsea have goal scores and and so do villa villa also has the winner this week in cuckoo he subs on subs on he looks great and they have a lot of depth there its its more of like thats a basket case with a lot of new going on so how is that going to go consistently but phil its just like a lot of steady stable with a couple of tweaks around the edges in the in the periphery with a couple like rogers coming into the fold and the defense well see how the defense settles when they get mings back diego carlos back like all of a sudden youre looking and like okay like they could they could they could fight two they could fight on two front so ifting them off but im just saying like to me theyre just another team in the group its not clearly im totally with you the group is theres a few teams and like if i was betting i would bet on villa i do wonder what the betting ons are i have no idea but lets i think we have can just throw a rogue thing in there i still think that theres something with west ham this year like i just think theres something there they win the late the late point iny i just i feel like lope tegui like after a couple months is gone the first 11 is as good as any team in the league like talk about fourth place that first 11 can finish in fourth place im im very certain of that with pack and fullest krw kudus bowen well full krw has to play before he has to like not go to germany again alvarez somerville like they have too when he start kilman like 1b they have theyre theyre good i think theyre going to be good theyve been pretty bad so far but theyve had difficult fixtures it wouldnt surprise me when theyre playing once a week and everyones back and he can ride them and get them into the patterns of play that he wants that they could go on a big run and be a tough out for the top teams like i agree with the tough out part its its just hard when theyre sitting here with one win one draw two losses already theyre going to have to le teams no youre thats fair thats it would it would take a lot but i feel like theyre one of the more theyre one of the more roger teams i just i like that i like the way the squad look so well see and bournemouth i like too i dont think theyre fourth but like theyre going to cause a lot of problems c cver on pens now pick is he definitely because ev so bad at pens should be tav is also like two for two in his career tav but it was the same as glasner but he said he was like its the two of them so they chose and they picked they rolled the wrong choice i should have that also is insane to me that managers dont set that initially like theyre too py theyre so to say its you and not you because they want to like massage both of them like its a democracy on the field when theyre emotional and football thing that we will never understand there is american sport in a flagrant foul and its like you five decide who takes the free throw inad of feeling that its like no our best free throw ridiculous hes the only one that ever takes it and everyone knows its insane and if hes not in the pitch its this guy this guy this guy this guy in that order its crazy its its bizarre were jumping around theres one more topic i want to touch on and then get to questions and everything else will just move until friday my life thursday pod but so wia is just out for months shots my guy heyo benj said is shot straight in with a whist out for months i love the match up for spurs in the river of green pictures seems great x50 with wia and thiago out and bredford having great running fixures is shot a pick am i crazy or is shota just like an incredible pick how does he stack up against your other incredible pick friend mcneel theyre the two best picks in the game no if shota is the striker hes the better pick strike striker hes playing up top with bumo up top well its not that obvious though because i was thinking about it earlier you think it could be kp and car and car or what carvalo it could be carvalo you think it could be car well theyre going to play three all look all these fixtures the spurs is a little bit but from that they have a run where theyre playing three forward so its between it seems like when they play a back three which is not relevant but im just talking it out loud but be for this weekend it will be for this weekend when they play it back three it seems like kp is left wing back wing back and then they play two forwards and so we think itll be shaab bumo but it could be carvalo buma and then in games where theyre favored whatever theres three i dont know i just think that the two with carve wont work hes just not an outlet like how is he going to be in the game if its just him and bumo the thing hes a weird player and i havent watched him that much because hes always been on loan but i do know he scored nine goals at whole last year he b he played forward in like half the games he wasnt playing like hes not a wide man hes like a number 10 or a nine and a half weiro so like if youre going to ask me let me put it this way if both of them get 2000 forward minutes like that who scores more goals i think its carvalo for sure score goals better and like hell assist more and hell win pens and hes just good but like i dont know it depends what he values i think no im im with you on shot i think hes a good pick i do think that hes going to be ahead of car on the packing order me too that would both this weekend and moving forward i feel like its going to be more like carve and kp maybe fight and like damgard they just dont have they dont have any dard anymore no i know well he plays them periodically but they just dont have anybody so youre looking at bumo sha and carve like when they play three up thats what it has to be and hell probably play kp at or hes just not going to play in those games or maybe its also kp cuz he doesnt want to play so love sh dude i was shouting shot in preseason like 5 five hes and i was saying like it will take multiple injuries for that to be a thing and here we are multiple injuries multiple in i think like he played so few top level minutes but in those minutes hes does good so and its its difficult because him and mcneel both have a very similar very long very good run and you look if youre on wild card you could build a team with both no problem and put money elsewhere you could do some funky because theres and were not even talking about seeno but all of a sudden you sorry had the assist i dont think hes a pick but all of a sudden were looking at like multiple sub six million midfielders that look good so you could dude an esr under the radar i know he gets subbed every game but hes been huge for me points in four weeks the assist was just everything and the goal sick assist and he gets he gets a bone and then the 10 pointer in the other game i cant ask for more no and he could also just be someone that you just hold forever like hes just going to be doing this like all year and just trickling in with points and the t just like weve talked about f every year with mil is like they play to the level of their opposition theyre fine theyre always going to be fine theyre always going to finish in 12th or whatever listen if im if i wild guard hes probably not making the team he not hes not jumping these other guys but its at least another name in that price bracket that if you set your team up in this way youve got seeno esr shota dwight these are four guys that are under six that if you build your team and rogers we havent even mentioned who just i dont even own him and im still offended by what happened fine i own him starting every week i think i was just rooting for you so hard that it was just too disgusting to even like comment on like there are so many guys in this price bracket that maybe that is the best way to build the team cuz where there are not players are in the price bracket between six and seven and a half or six and like 10 honestly like theres not that many kai aside if were just talking about like midfielders well hes a forward but hes a forward so im saying like forget about him theres like kev and foden which are just like i dont know theyre going to get some points but like i dont know then theres bruno odard diaz jota who are now both rotation ris both getting subbed early mat bowens pick shout out to bowen shout out to walshs bowen not a three returns of four good gordon theres very few guys e gets a downgrade marnelli is bad rashford ra maybe razzle emerges the best pick in the actual i was also looking at kevin how insane it is that hes played n 90 minutes all year and hes at two returns its just impossible hes he is a pick in game week seven if or like even game week six wild cards i think that theres a possibility that like you have holland saka and kev like can that be a team like i think i think it can be a team like when is he cant play 4000 minutes though like is he just gonna is he gonna him because hes leaving all i know is hes fit now and hes playing now and hes still the second best player on the team and i dont know they need to win some game so i dont know this pod could easily go on for another two hours is what im sensing so lets jump to questions bang some out move on we you also have fantasy champions league you have to navigate im good i have my teams set benett ben has any fuckle fantasy champions league shouts i dont have any i dont even know lot of shot like who are the i dont have my team open whos the best pick in the game in that game let me open my team there are 15 of them and theyre all on my team let put it that way theres too many i opened the thing theres too many teams im not participating in this i will very happily enjoy it from afar this is going to take my computer 10 minutes open so ccle back well we just talked about all these glue guys but big dunks and jaia are asking us to like rank the glue guys seeno mcneil esr rogers boomo bone i dont think bumo and bone qualify for glue necessarily do they bumo does so i bumo is the best of all of them for sure seeno just keeps putting up numbers and theyre theyre at anfield this week but then its home they just have such mixed fixtures dont want to play them this week dont want to play them in eight dont want to play them in 10 which is annoying and hard to navigate but if youre wild card you can navigate that the issue with seeno is as good as he looks every game i watch him is just the he has no avenues like his literal only aven is open play and when youre looking at the picks around the game its hard for that to trump players that have more than just the singular avenue and its not like bournemouth have been good but its not like they create a million chances and theyre so attacking its like not the case at all thats been the case it could change when they have better fixtures and they dont have better fixtures for a while so were looking at the next five six they have the southampton leer game and they have bad fixtures in and around those theyre good fixture run starts in game m 11 where they have a wide birth but i think its interesting like seeno to shot for example and shot is going to be playing forward so seeno plays forward like a little bit more wind and a little bit wider those are those are close calls so id rather have shot its its also the fixtures matter like maybe you want shot for the next five or six and then you get seeno but i might with seeno is he has to have good fixtures like youre not playing this in bad fixtures and that is the same for all of these five5 mids like all of them seo mcneil esr rogers shota if they have bad fixtures you dont want to play them mean the main difference where its like jiao pedros interesting or dcl is interesting is that doesnt matter because they have pens they have pens so where youre putting your five picks with its mid or the third forward or what all of this adds up to which one fits best in your team just to look at it in those ways right totally agree all right i got my fuckle team up okay back to fuckle what are we looking at here so we got few mill in the bank because we dont need that much money in this game no big deals i dont know i love hearing about it then we have tan and d gregorio in goal hes the uve goalie classic defense is chan my god a legend i love beston so much cambiaso whos some uve defender whos like forward and cambiaso classic cen cambiaso a classic hakeim is in there love them of course pongs in there love him midfield we have pulik american has to have american representation raph in easy in wartz didnt have him in europe euros so we put him in here m cuz its my god m alis cuz well how could i not have alis that was the first name i put in my team by easily captain and then the easy captain i knew i know you i know my dude thats the first thing thats the first thing its like and they play the first time why you play its like just to be able to do that and then ive got fahashi up top celtic genius okay gores he scores a million goals right for aashi hell keep it up korus on sporting forward okay genius that guy is everyone talking about that guy and then adm benfica back to his roots its because youre watching the documentary you got d maria thats right love that love it great team those are they answer the question previous those are all the best picks in the game josh b said keeper talk is ria worth a free transfer if i hendo lets compare their points and see how thats played out so far rya got more points this week than hendo has had all year combined rys on 29 and hendos on eight and if we do the math from earlier where youre third 12 points higher than me and youre 350000 places higher than me okay let me do a little math here i think id be like top 5k if i had goalkeeper matters a lot well especially if what you were talking about in discord is true and riot just keeps farming bones on every clean because theyre going to keep a lot of cleans especially when they play like that so far so true he kept more saves than he typically would but even i think even if he had a couple less saves i think he still would have been clear of let me have a look over here what are we doing he was still eight ahead of saka he could have had two or three less saves and still been in two or one bonus look the next closest bps was white on 23 and rya got 33 thats a huge gap five saves is a lot say he made save is worth two bps so if he made two or three its only six or eight less hes still hes still pretty comfortably clear and on bones over the defenders youba cba got a card so he would have been up to 25 if he didnt its getting closer but again its back to it just its close and when you get it he gets two more dude hes ridiculous like its ridiculous i think like people who wild card this week people who wild card next week it just seems like everyone is just waiting to wild card to like make that move and if you can make the move without having to wild card thats even better but this everyone that was wild carding this week didnt get him because the city i dont know they got for buan or they listen to me lrod we were saying like hes the only guy to get we dont get any of the defenders get him me too i weve been saying this for the whole last two weeks but rya dude its just its so painfully obvious and its like who was that im sorry to call out friends from discord but who is the absolute savage psycho who wildcarded into hendo keeper remember that moment this weekend hes like who can i get the actual worst pick in his position this is my guy for the next 20 weeks that guy needs to re wild he got hacked email official f you got hacked and hes just using a transfer there but rya its just so obvious its just free real estate guy said four weeks in i still feel like we dont have a strong sense of which teams are good outside the usual suspects filla and newcastle are up in the top five but feel unconvincing is its still too early to know we talked about that already and were going to start looking at a whole new game now that europes starting were gna have to start taking close notes on how managers are rotating and how theyre using their squad so well see there i also i wanted to ask you also about rico cuz got the halftime sub that was x50 is next thing he said its it time to start panicking about rico like youre youre not onlooker how do you see this with him arsenal next europe starting kyle played you still just start him every week i think halftime sub is very unp to me and that its it was also warranted because that game was completely out of control and they were lucky to not be down 20 or 30 as pep also said in the in the postmatch so i think it was just a weird situation theyre still integrating roger back in and as soon as rogery came back in the game was over so i still think like any time rico starts hes the best four five you have he should start and in games when he doesnt start youre just praying he stays on the bench i still think the same rules apply especially now that rs back im with you thats how i was looking at it people were pretty frantic and panicking about it theres nothing like its just i dont know theres so many complications to fpl but if everyone was flying this week everyone in discord was flying this week and that happened to rico they would just be like love rico whatever it matter wont happen all the disasters its just like and rico like i have to know just relax the concern with rico is he starts midweek which that would be bad for but also i dont even know if it would be bad for him well i think because say it is but then but no i understand but then you look at that and you think okay well that means hes playing three center backs and kyle against arsenal prob play i dont think hell play versus arsenal which also as youve said is not bad thats fine even though thats probably going to be a nil so like do you should i start him or well talk about it after the midweeks well talk about it after the midweeks but it would be nice i think to figure it out now before we get biased from the midweeks to me what are other options well i have po just chilling po wolves too its i i dont know about but to me i imagine that ricos going to start midweek and not start against arsenal like thats how this going that would be logical but i just think pep is like very illogical and sometimes he does stuff that we dont think about so its not even worth trying to think about it i dont think that like this means that i think its much more complex than that so its just if i have him i need to just dont even think or look at if hes fit just start him i think so okay if hes not fit you can just him too hell still get autoed fine with that im fine with that i think thats where i come down okay lets see i dont know we could probably push all these i think to well theres a couple lifestyle ones maybe we do those and then wrap it up and push everything else to thursday sounds good fl doom said why do you support your specific new york teams why mets not yankees why jets and giants and not giants jets family reasons geographical reasons or other reasons you start off with this one i can start my dad is from brooklyn and was a huge brooklyn dodgers fan aka yankees enemy number one he despises everything to do with the yankees and i was raised that way and i also despise them and why jets i think its just my brothers its just like the team that we always rooted for i dont even there was no point in my life when i decided it was just like im a jet fan i dont know so thats it it was more it was more circuitous for me because my parents didnt watch sports or know anything about sports their whole lives so my moms from queens and like thats whatever but for me it was more just like my friends and it took me like a few different teams to get to like any of to the mets like i was like i like this team or that team or i like i like allen iverson so like that team but like i think as i got older into like more middle school age and i half my friends are giants fans half for jets fans half for mets fans half for yankees fans i just got to like pick the ones that resonated more with me at the time and for me it just fell into mets and giants so thats how it went for me thats how it is i will say as a jets fan still one of the alltime great sports moments i think in both of our lives was at youre visiting me with a bunch of other friends at marty were all blacked out insanity i didnt black out until after we no until after what just trying to represent the chaos around us and then giants beat the in the super bowl outside insane and then the other lifestyle question is mc marman he said does your love of fpl in sports general ever create friction with your partner or is it just me wow well youre newly partnered how are you doing over there with shars theres a little friction here and there not gonna lie ngls not going to lie when it comes to footy its easier for two reasons one i its my job and so im like i got to watch this shout out to fml hey its an income source and the other reason is its early not as early as it is on the west coast but its like i can reason be like ill be done by noon some week some days ill be done by two some days whatever and we can still do during the day do at night when it comes to nfl though its a hard its like when i was single same with you when youre single you cant do the 1 pm to 1100 pm im watching football that is not acceptable so you just got to suck it up and thats just not reality anymore if youre an a real intense sports fan like we are it is in inevitably fr frictitious fractious has to be with your wife its just it has to be because its all you want to do and they dont give a about its like they could not care they could not give a they couldnt tell you one player and one league thing so but its you and i have that little cheat card where its like were making money on this so we have to in air quotes have to do it which is partially true but also we could we could get by watching games in other times and this and that but its fun to watch it live and we look forward to it so we want to do it but exactly its all bargaining like its all about whats reasonable what are my responsibilities i have a kid you dont like so that changes things and you have to look at the equation and prioritize like if i were single the amount of sports i watch would probably be 400 more than what i if not higher than what i watch now when you factor in baseball its every night when hours every night when laurens not here all i do is sports are on all the time its not its not ever off like people have hobbies like they go play golf like i just like watching sports like thats all i want to do like im happy so happy to watch sports like i could do it every day all day i just love watching sports and thinking about it and all the things so like when laurens not here for a couple days like i have dam so thats a bit like i just i would just watch sports like i would just watch sports nonstop and the one edge i have and its i have to pat myself on the back here because im good at getting people into and sharon is just in on nfl she just loves the drama of football loves watching loves like the pace of it she couldnt give a about baseball unless were there soccer whatever loves nfl so theres we do some errands we do some stuff on sundays but then its like all right well im gonna come back put the game on shes like put it on put it on im like yes im gonna sit here for the next eight hours hopefully thats how it goes thats how it goes but you have like you cant like watch sports over your relationship thats insane so you just have to mature and figure out like you have to mature and realize whats important or start a podcast and start earning money and both exactly s of i think the biggest cheat code would be if you had a successful gambling podcast because then you could spend anything is like no i got it i gotta watch i put 20k on this is a huge match for the blah but you already put 20k so does it matter if you watched it it matters so much i got to talk about it i have got the guy on tuesday all right well push all the other questions i think to thursday let me slap asses we havent ped in a while so
