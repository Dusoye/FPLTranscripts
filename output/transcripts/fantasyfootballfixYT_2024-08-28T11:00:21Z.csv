yes guys welcome back to another fancy football fix youtube video my name is fp nao and in todays video we are looking at the top transfers going into game week 3 we need to talk about some of the most bought players going into your teams in particular those budget midfielders and those chelsea midfielders is one of those is certainly going to be fpl gold so if youre looking for todays video make sure you do drop a and of course smash that subscribe button enough waffling lets get into todays video so first up we have to talk about some budget forwards that are be in a lot of peoples teams come game week three and one of the most bought players is going to be danny welbeck were back to back goals in game week one and two managers feel this is the one to go for 56m now the numbers are good 104 xg over the course of those two games five shots not the best shot volume but still decent especially for somebody danny welbeck and 1486 expected fpl points yes he is overperforming with 21 overall fpl points but still really solid underlying numbers and i believe he second best for expected fpl points only to earling hland of course now the big thing about wellbe right now is naturally a lot of managers were tempted to go to xiao pedro at 55m i think we all know that he was the goto fpl player especially esecially thinking that he was going to be on penalties but welbeck is the one that has emerged as the better option at the time of recording you can see here is xg 043 nowhere near that of danny welbecks the shot volume very similar and in terms of actual fpl output only 10 points compared to danny welbecks 21 now the reason why im a little bit hesitant to bring in any brighton player come gw three is because that really tricky fixture away against arsenal of course the international break begin between gw 3 and gw 4 i feel if you can postpone those brighton players for one more game we and look to buy them in gw four with ip switch at home followed by noton and forest at home and even chelsea away i dont think is a terrible fixure for brighton i think just gaining one more game wes worth of information is the best route to go there because rutter being signed from leads is going to be a rotation risk were seeing ferguson back on the bench for brighton in their midweek cup game that is going to be minutes risks all of these assets and even though danny welbeck looks a great pick i think we wait one more game week reassess the brighton team and then decide what direction to go for let me know your thoughts in the comments but for me game week 3 is not the right time to be brian a bright and forward and if i was to pick between the two i actually feel longer term xiao pedro is the one thats going to get more minutes therefore i prefer going for him at the slightly cheaper price of 55m so those are the budget forwards right now lets take a look at some of those budget midfielders for your teams so similar to the brighton forwards there are a lot of budget midfielders that we need to consider especially for those fpl managers that are looking at in kungu replacements and need to free up some funds to invest elsewhere in their team the three players that were looking at right now is going to be rogers of aston villa fulham smith row and bournemouth seeno all of these very differing ownerships right now seeno being the least owned at around 25 but you can see his numbers here hes putting up some of the best numbers of all midfielders regardless of price 114 xg is fantastic and 162 expected assist he is offering an allround package right now and really stepping up to the plate as a bit of a slanky replacement in this bournemouth team and 12 shots as well is ridiculous for a 55m midfield especially when we compare that to the other two options who are actually getting a lot more traction coming into gw three both smith thr and rogers are being bought by a lot more managers than that of seeno only five shots of rogers two shots for smith row so based on the underline numbers seeno is actually the one to go for however fixtures are also important to consider you can see here for bournemouth everton away to be fair everton have been poor this season so it isnt a terrible fixture but i always think at goodson park you are always in for a tough game then they have chelsea at home now on paper that sounds difficult and i would expect bournemouth to be in for a tough game but defensively chelsea are all over the place right now so i actually dont think these fixures are as bad as what they first look yes liverpool way in the following fixure is not great but then southampton at home i think even though seenos fixtures are the toughest of the three i still think we can buy him and not be completely put off by those fixtures but when we look at rogers fixtures for example the numbers are decent 029 xg 068 expected assists and anybody thats been watching these aston villa games will know that rogers has been the standout option playing 90 minutes and both playing very central influencing the game in the right areas could have easily picked up assist in one of the games as well and coming into some fantastic fixtures lester away everton at home wolves at home and i switch away the major concern about aston villa in general is the introduction of the champions league around game week four game week five this could be a problem for aston villa as a team as theyre going to be putting their best 11 out midweek every time they have the champions league and that is going to include morgan rogers so could we see a little bit of rotation with rogers on the weekend games potentially that is my only downside for rogers because right now i do think he is the standout budget midfielder now the alternative is going to be smith row i think he has good numbers 045 xg decent f pictures ips switch west ham newcastle forest and i do think this game time is only going to improve as we progress down the game weeks the money that fulham has spent on smith row i expect him to have decent game time now while early substitutions still will remain the theme for him so in terms of budget midfielders if youre looking for the form player it is sano and i wouldnt be put off by the fixtures but based on everything that weve seen the numbers the it test and the fixtures i think rightly so rogers is the best pick at 5m hes a brilliant downgrade from in kunu if you want to free up the funds otherwise i think id go sano take the pun on those fixtures just because the underlying numbers have been so fantastic for him in the opening two game weeks now finally in terms of inu replacements we got to look at chelsea because the fixtures for chelsea are good crystal palace at home in gw three bournemouth away in gw four west ham away maybe a little bit more different than we first thought then brighton at home in the following game week it really does feel this chelsea attack are exciting but getting the right asset is the big problem for managers now we know right now in kungu is being sold by a lot of managers and mad is one of the most bought players going into gw 3 off the back of that hattrick in gw two now very difficult right now to understand mad as an option didnt get picked in gw one now suddenly a must own player in all of our fpl teams i personally think there is a little bit of a kneejerk reaction bringing mad into the team 098 xg in gw 2 is fantastic but is this going to be sustainable numbers him putting up this xg and delivering hattricks no we definitely do need to reduce our expectations of this chelsea winger but on that right hand side i only think its mad or pedro netto for that side i really do think theyre going to view co palmer as either a number 10 or potentially on that right hand side in certain fixtures so i do think for the next few game weeks m could be a viable option but im going to be honest with you i also could see an in kungu 20 situation where he becomes a minutes risk and we see rotation each and every game week i do think if you want the 65m he probably is the best of the bunch but it does beg the question do we maybe just buy one of the best options in the game in co palmer at 105 yes he is a lot more expensive but whether he plays in the 10 false 9 or off the right he is going to have the most minutes of all of these midfielders in the game now looking at the underline numbers he has played two games as opposed to mads one but 28 xg 96 expected assists we really did see the cole palmer of last season in the game against wolves and i really do think if youre looking to restructure your team i would ignore all of the 65m midfielders and just get yourself the best of the bunch in cole palmer especially with teams arsenal having a tricky run of fixtures maybe the move of sacka to co palmer in gw four could actually be a brilliant move and if youre looking to bring him in gw three that is a fantastic differential captaincy pick for your fpl teams at home against palace so to conclude if you have to go for a 65m midfielder i do think at chelsey is mad but i do think you are going to get problems later down the line otherwise cole palmer is the man to own so last that we need to take a look at maybe the captaincy options for our teams based on the fantasy football fix predicted points so here we have the gw 3 predicted points top 10 leading the line is going to be of course erland hen with 67 predicted points a way against west ham i actually do think is quite a tricky fixture with the recruitment that theyve done the west ham that we saw in gw 2 i actually think it is a gw where we can consider going somewhere different with our captaincy especially when were seeing someone sacka 64 predicted points a good home game against brighton sacka ticking over really nicely and of course with midfielders getting an additional point for a goal and a clean sheet i think there definitely is an argument this game week to maybe lean towards sacka hs looking really good on the predicted points but i wouldnt feel confident going havocs over someone an erling hland and of course most salah away against man united is not a terrible fixture at all we have seen him do the damage in the past at old trafford so i would lean towards probably going for erin hland over mosalah based on the predicted points but if you want to go for a bit of a differential this game week and you own cole palmer i really do think that is the play to go for this week 51 predicted points but at home against a crystal palace team that are struggling defensively i do think that is a brilliant option for your fbo teams its just whether you have kmer in your team outside of that rey predicted to 47 been one of the standout goalkeepers this season gordon at 46 and odard at 46 as well i really do think if you own go gordon and isach you do keep for the spurs game as spurs even though they were very good in gw 2 do give the opposition chances and i think in the counterattack newcastle have the players available to hurt them in transition so those are the game week through predicted points i still think harland is a stand out pick but if you have palmer id be very tempted to go for him as a differential captain and thats going to wrap up todays video thank you so much for tuning in this of course was the top transfers going into game week 3 if you think there are any other players that should have been included in the video please do put them in the comment section well be sure to
