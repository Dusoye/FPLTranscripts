my word i dont know where to begin it was a horrible saturday for fbl and certainly for my fbl team and we got to start with the sacka situation from my perspective i was i was away all week in bulgaria thats why i didnt do the blackbox stream and so i was i had limited time to soak up information and team news and so on i caught some friday night got back that evening land looked at my team on saturday and i was going to roll my transfer u where i stood on saturday i was i was 80 certain that he would start because as we know hes had knocks in the past and the comments from carsle artetta were were positive lets face it so i thought he was i was certainly 8020 thinking he was going to start at bournemouth then i rolled the transfer but i almost wavered so 15 minutes before deadline i saw a tweet from what i thought was a reliable source charles watts which turned out to be boer if you dont know booner account on twitter who posts a troll post to misleading team news as a joke a joke it can be funny to be fair and this was one of his tweets and i fell for it so i put that tweet in the godfather tier chat to try and help people in there that this tweet was out there its public just in case you aint seen it 15 minutes ago sacas not playing i then went to my desk went to take sacker out put son in because it was it was looking like he was going to start he was he was back to fitness and it was a risk worth taking with the fixtures that spurs had and then i looked at whatsapp and there it was as was saying among others that was a boa post and it was fake so i didnt make the transfer cuz i was back to thinking 8020 sacka would start turns out that as saw my post thought it was weird as well made the transfer then realized too late it was a fake one i dont know crazy and then of course didnt turn up and i didnt get son and well talk about son and the assisted a bit but the rest his history of course sacker didnt turn up and then it turns out a load of content creators made last minute changes which im not surprised about im particularly not surprised about because then after the deadline i watched the arsenal fan tv video in which they one of the content creators on there if you can call them that said that sack was a major doubt and wouldnt play now had i seen that before deadline that for me would have made me 5050 no smoke without fire and then i would have made the transfer to song cuz 5050 would be enough for me but i didnt see it i didnt know that but what i can say is if i was among the content creators or other people who saw that in advance of deadline then i would have made that s transfer so i think its fair enough so all these people accusing content creators having secret information i think its pretty unfair because i can only go on what i know i didnt get any secret information and had i seen that arsenal fan tv id have been 5050 and id have made the transfer the song cuz logically it makes sense with this with the fixtures so i can only stand up for that view that it was all open and above board and a logical decision and of course youre going to make the decision late because youre going to wait till the final moment in case you do get a leak in case you do get public information thats going to sway you like sacker scene at the ground so its all understandable but i didnt benefit from it i didnt make the change because i thought he was going to start and i didnt see that arsenal fan tv clip which for me that would have been enough cuz it suggested that there was an itk out there who had information and it would have just tipped me 5050 and i would have made that transfer but anyway i hope i hope thats not a slid indoors moment for my season it has been a terrible game week i went into the arsenal bournemouth game with sacka with cba and with gabrielle celba got the red card sacka didnt turn up and arsenal lost the game 20 celba red card means hes out against liverpool which is a major blow to them in that game and it means that ill probably have to sell celba now with the two tree transfers ive got ahead of the next game week as for bournemouth you mean seeno was a stand out against six shots one chance created hes now had 37 shots 10 more than any other m fielder and in the end they won the game with a training ground set piece played ar at their own game a very good corner and a penalty its now four out clean sheet for arsenal and its liverpool newcastle and chelsea in the next three i think that i dont think im holding sacka its a hamstring injury could he could miss that game i think im going to be moving him out and its going to be ca going as well so with those fixtures and with a dip in form and confidence im definitely moving away from arsenal and then theres the son assist so the way i see it is the error here is on the tributing the own goal to arola because i think once you recognize that its an arola own goal rather than a tbo own goal you recognize that final touch that arola had and then that means that son shot has the initial save from arola ricochet back off to theo then the final touch from marola which was pivotal enough to be cited as a means to give him the own goal so thats three touches the rul say that for an assist to be awarded from an own goal the player awarded the assist has to directly force the own goal now i dont think in this case you can say that because by giving it to aras known goal were recognizing that his touch is a significant one presumably toos touch back towards goal wasnt on target and it was aras final touch that b it to b it to be a goal so therefore sunshot didnt directly lead to that go it was toos touch back the ricochet off too from the save the initial save mariola which was what forced the own goal the finals hch from marola therefore for me its no assist now had it been a tobo own goal id be more sympathetic i think it would be an assist then because for me the sun shop would force to save the ricochet off to debo and in but because theyve said arola a goal theyve recognize that third touch i dont think we can say son directly cost it therefore its no assist for me and there is presidents here if you go back to 2022 first game of the season man utd ball comes off the back of dow towards the bright and goal sanchez saves it onto mallister but mallister knocks the ball in for an own goal to mallister no assist was given to dow even though dows touch was sending the ball goldw and it was sanchez who saved it onto mall but no assist was given to dow he didnt benefit because presumably they felt that dows touch didnt force the own goal cuz mallister got the own goal and it was sanchezs save which forced the own goal but its the same here its tobos touch back the ricochet back to arola that forces the own goal therefore to be consistent with that incident in 2022 its no assist now whats crazy is it was no assist and then at 900 for some reason an assist was added and a tweet went out the tweet was later removed because there was a lot of negative reaction to it i stayed out of that but i just dont see it can be awarded assist if youre going to be consistent with what was gone before theres another incident the gapbo incident from last year against west ham arola own goal again ironically he had a shot that was off target but that doesnt matter the shot came off of ogbon onto such on the line and off of arola for an own goal arola own goal then as well nothing was given to gpo because his shot didnt directly forc the own goal from mariola if anything it was suchs touch on the line which forced the own goal so its the same again son shot didnt directly force the own goal because it was a touch back the ricochet off tobo that made arola score the own goal because it was credited to him now i dont think it should have been credited to him i think thats the mistake and in that case it would have been an assist in my book but arola and goal no assist for me as for the game itself son came out with a goal and assist came out with 047 xgi five shots two chances created a decent game you look good in spells but it was johnson who came out with a top xgi 93 overall five shots all in the box again looked to threet and its just that shot volume in the box that intrigues me hes had 26 shots this season all of them in the penalty area and in the end that volume thats got to offer value going forward madison has been a consideration but he won off at halim tactical decision by an to bring sa on and that was the trigger for the turnaround in the second half and spurs just blew west ham away so johnson continues to catch the eye i may go him over son of a bit more time this week if i if it is sacka who does make way ahead of liverpool game depending of whether sacka turns up for midweek european game of course the other player to talk about here sanky concerning just one shot one chance created had a look at the average position maps he was the deepest of all the spurs attacker so ahead so with madison kuresi johnson and son all four of them ahead of salanki in terms of the touches the average touches that they had on the pitch and you can see it with the it test he was coming deep he was linking play runners getting beyond him he wasnt getting the end of things that as i said one shot one chance thats not enough 012 xgi is a concern im already thinking that despite the fixtures i dont know if hes going to deliver the volume of points that i need from him and moveing havs after arsenals fixtures soften up a bit might be the way to go i think as for west ham i know two more players i want to is porro and a doggy went forward and pouring forward loads porro in particular scares me not having him he had for shots and two chances created on the day a doggy three chances created and got the assist but porro for me is the eye catcher 16 shots now the top amongst defenders this season that volume has got to pay off even without clean sheets i think hes a player that we need to keep on our adars and i think with the fixtures that spurs have got i may well be moving cba down to him depending on how the budget goes for me west ham now kudos got the goal well taken but then got the red card so hes out for three games and thats painful for west h because their fixtures are better now but theyre going to miss kudos who is is a big outlet for them bowen could have got the assist his cross to kudos did take a def flection and it did look as though it was intended for antonio i can see why it wasnt given harsh low for boeing owners those brave enough to go for the differential missing out on points again and we kidos out i just think that bo and ro remain a very lowly owned differential so everton won 2n at portman road a big fixture for it which they i found wanting i starting to fear for them i did have some good feelings about the liks of the lap and davis going into a better fixture run but 389 now is their xg for the season its the lowest in the division by quite a margin davis came out with three chances created and he does have 20 chances created for the season more than any other defender but i just see them scoring enough goals for him to convert that into assists dap has got four goals and he came out with a couple of shots in this game but i think it 018 his xg and davis was 023 just too low and everton had too much for him in midfield and they cope well of them at the back and in the end ran out at a caner for them calvin le was the stand out in terms of xgi 132 he had five shots in the game big frustration for calv l owners that he came out of a blank he had a couple of oneon ones which m did well with but cav l should have profited m neil got an assist now created 25 chances for the season second only to sacker amongst midfielders so he continues to offer value kean got the other goal he could be an option at the back but bran freight is near in fitness mikeno would be the better option he came back in to the side at left back did play deep didnt get forward too much but at 43 hes got to be worth a look now that everton fixes continued to be decent pford low backtoback clean sheets is e the answer for those who dont have ryar or for those who are giving up on ry after asked on conceding goals certainly its a good its a good couple of game weeks for pford and everton and suddenly theyre starting to look like they could be a source of value to us as well andai got the goal but it was some an error hes another one we could keep an eye on as a cheap forward option and again just going back to itwi they did make errors nine errors now for the season the most of any team its level with sampton and those defensive errors coupled with the fact they cant score goals could take them down half fought victory for villa at craen cottage rogers came in with his third goal in the season could have had more mr sitter before half time and came out with three shots 88 xgi which the pass watkins 41 he got his goal over and just two shots smartly taken header from matans corner and then v villa sealed it with an own goal as for fulham jenez was a standout again hes now returned in five successive games got the goal here four goals and one assist now in the last five for him could have had an assist as well if it wasnt for pereiras miss penalty because jnez forced the hand ball could be significant that because it was such a badly taken penalty from andes pereira that himz could step in now and take them to ad to his appeal even more 57 fulham have still got good fixtures he looks like hes going a new lease of life which is great to see a for fpl legend at walls born again at fulham definitely a consideration with the fixures that fulham have got and the confidence theyre playing with i dont think this defeat dilla will be a major setback are we finally going to get to look at some man united attackers maybe it was a good showing from the front three against brenford run out two one winners rashford gacho and hland all starting to click maybe or hinting at something hland came into the side and did impress he had three shots not 43 one chance created as well got his well taken goal from a lovely bruno assist only a second return of the season for bruno owners there gacha was a stand out load 10 shot creation involvements in the game week more than any other player thats eight shots and two chances created only 43 xgo it shows you that perhaps the quality of the chance wasnt great but theres potential here we know about garnacho hland needs games and needs consistency but maybe just first shoots of some progress that means we can start to consider united in the future theres five good fixes to come as well so who knows maybe not for me at the moment but one to monitor thats for sure as for brenford they capitalized on delit off the pitch to score from a corner that set piece thre is always there pinnick second goal of the season nothing too much more to talk about and bumo was kept quiet vandenberg started it right back again in the four and looks like it could be an option and visa was back on the bench got 30 minutes at the end good fixure still the next three it s fman bouth visa at 59 could it be al budget forward option i meant to say fleen got nine saves in that game now hes made more saves 42 than any other keeper hanson of leicester is second and he was involved in a ridiculous game at st mars where leicester run out 32 winners having been twonil down at halim great result for steve cooper side of course disaster for russell martins in this game its brian nut again who stood out five shots three chances created 145 xgi the highest in the game week he started out playing out on the on the right flank then when fatu came on everything changed for two did make an impact very lively in 31 minutes 51 xgi two shots and one chance created he had his pace frightened s anon and helped turn the game around bonan went to a central role number 10 got the first goal back and played a part those two played a part in the comeback and well its just tragic for sa anon theyve as i said made nine errors now six leading to goals the most in the division look suspect at set plays as well i think its 56 xg conceded at set plays the highest in the league and they got caught right at the end again rell martin seems to have a trouble on these corners he piles men into the box but leaves the edge of the box free and thats what lester did and they scored the equalizer assa the winner r iu to go three to up before that archer got his second in successive games and well could maybe another budget option if you would need to go down to 5m an intered manning 43 defender appeared to play left wing so they had dibling on one flank manning on the other so he was played out of position but mean while s hun look as brle as they do even on outter position defender playing up front is not going to tempt us is it super one nil win for brighton at newcastle wellber with his fifth goal of the season second now only a harland amongst forwards but did pick up a back injury so thats one to monitor if youre eying out well back for your forward lines a great a great victory for brighton they did it without matoma who started on the bench after international duty thats one to look for herzler looks to give players a rest after interal break so thats worth noting matoma came on though and hes still the standout player amongst that brighton team for me as for newcastle well they had plenty of chances they dominated the first half isach had nine shot involvements alog together seven shots two chances created for 088 xgi similarly golden four shots three chances created for 07 xgi those two we need to come into form again to give us those options but theyve typified newcastle this season just so erratic no consistency flat deceive and eak needs to find these shooting boots 83 it would be quite something if him and gordon could come alive again so thats all of saturdays games covered ive got four players today foden harland captain and lewis against wolves and then trent playing chelsea later i need some points ive only got 14 i think it is with seeno coming off the bench for sacka at the moment so it looks like a miserable game week and a red arrow for me but im not alone low scores everywhere its one of those game weeks i think you did well if you had broken 20 points from saturdays games as has of course but i dont want to talk about that then weve got forest palace on monday night so i might have to do that one from the shed to get this out in time so look out for that but thats all from me now and ill see you in the morning good morning so harem blanks for third successive game the first time hes ever done that in his man city career not only that he had very few touches no shots at all no chances created its only the third time in his career that hes had a game with zero shots when starting the last time was game we against arsenal last season so thats its a long time ago big regression hes had zero big chances in those three blanks where he had 10 big chances in the in the five games before that shows the aggression for those who wild carded him in and that includes me of course man city overall just struggled to break walls down i thought they lacked any penetration from out wide despite playing doku and savio greish and foden came off the bench to pep it up a little bit but they were they were devoid of ideas got the win of course foden got the assist from the corner from a from the stones header which was perhaps a bit fortuitous given the v check but overall city just huffed and puffed were a bit ploty a bit predictable and struggled but what do we do weve got to hold fodm weve got to hold harland we got to hold lewis weve got to hold gardio ahead of southampton in game week nine that is such a plum fixure the way that sa an are playing of course and varol got second goal of the season 28 touches in the box now i think hes just behind a doggy and lewis for that he continues to be a goal threat and that compensates for the lack of clean sheets that city get in but i dont know i think ive got to wait until deyne comes back to assess what i do with my man city assets i think foden if hes not going to be a reliable starter and sunday showed that i might have to think again on him and he might be the one to make way if im looking at palmer liverpool got the victory very difficult game against chelsea thought chelsea did very well but liverpool got the win in the end salah with the hall double figure return decimated our ranks that did only had the two shots two chances created 014 ex non penalty but of course got the penalty i think hes first of the season and then the assist for the curtis jones goal overall i think the major news elsewhere was diaz was benched perhaps expected after the international break thats something we got to look for that slot will do and it puts another question mark over him as a potential asset and then in the game j got injured after half an hour and got replaced by darwin so hes got an injury now so all of a sudden our options in that liverpool attack a cut back to maybe just s but we going there with palmer and harland and sacka on the list as well son of course so foden i havent but theres so many heavy hitters now demanding of our of those midfield slots and our money that sal has slipped off the ownership and thats why hes hold did so much damage to us elsewhere trent is a concern as well maybe hes someone whos going to give way as we look to pursue those heavy hitters no chances created in this game hes only created three chances over the last three games had four shots so no xgi from trent in this game and so you cant blame now people to waiver on him its arsenal next which is a difficult game are we going to get anything from trent then the fixtures do improve after that but given his price and his output at the moment you cant blame people for looking elsewhere as for chelsea parba was kept fairly quiet by curtis jones i thought he came out with four shots three in the box 56 xgi and he is top now for midfielders for xgi non penalty so hes still got to remain a target despite this being a difficult game for him as i said curtis jones did a good job on him in midfield and jackson came out of his fifth goal the season he 57 extra non penalty over the season now second only to harland amongst forwards there could be potential in this chelsea side beon palmer but hes got to remain the key target surely just ended at the city ground forest win one nil good performance and chris wood with the winner and lets lets talk about chriswood unbelievable hes now been involved in 62 of forest goals with on the pitch 7 8 shot accuracy 11 of his 16 shots been on target conversion rate of 31 its just incredible he continues to deliver why dont i have him in my team its it just seems crazy doesnt it a one nil win looks like sals is going to come out with a maximum bonus though i think he made six saves on the night including two worldies one from eay one from schook did well and a clean sheet again i think thats our third clean sheet cheat of the season happy with that result and from a forest point of view its wood and ss who the standouts minkovich and millo clean sheets again ana any of the back four look options but cs is beginning to look like potentially the four or five keeper to go for which you at one point i thought he wouldnt keep his place but hes put in performances out the bag now and all credit to him and then chris wood up front as you said elsewhere without gives white not a lot in midfield anderson played well won a lot of jewels but not a lot of nothing not fancy potential and e i think he had five shots again only one from inside the box hes had 32 shots now second only to cenia among midfielders but he just hes denied by a couple of sayes but again its just its just not working for palace is it nothing is going in for e and keto was poor in the first half mata apparently hes not fit although i dont know how they get ineta and mateta in the same team no theyre in trouble theyre too good to go down surely but theyre certainly in a fight now so a good final game forest good final game for me from a game week thats been terrible 26 points looks like im going down to 25m although there is going to be a change in points because the premier league today announced that theyre going to remove sons assist i think that will drop into one bonus as well so maybe thatll affect my rank as well good decision by the premier league and important that theyve gone back and corrected that if youve watched the video youve seen that i i did think that was a wrong decision and theyve come to that conclusion and corrected it and thats big for the game because it means that we can get decisions now that go wrong earlier corrected later in the game week right up until the end of end of the game week an hour after the game week on a monday night in this occasion so thats good for the future of the game good that theyve done that right decision i think for the reasons i said still think its a mistake me not getting son though i still think i made an eror there because i would have got some points instead of someo off the bench for only a couple and i think im going to end up looking at son for this game week because sacka doesnt look like he was in training today for the european tie against shaka so im gonna have to get rid of sacka and son could be on the menu so ive missed out on the points that he did get this week by doing that just a chain of events on saturday me not being about enough last week being too busy at work to soak up the team news and all the info on sacker as i said ive got to get better got to get better than 25m ill be back with blackbox with has later in the week if you enjoyed this video like and subscribe sorry there wasnt too much scenery in there with the weather it was difficult and i was pushed for time so hopefully when i do the next one the weathers better and i can get more of that in there like i say like and subscribe see you next time
