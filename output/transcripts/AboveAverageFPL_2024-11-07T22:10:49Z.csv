me right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam im always joined by baker and this evening we got chai how you doing chai you right all good adam thank you for having me on cheers boys quite often listen to the show and im here to share the most biased spurs opinions youve had so far sounds good thats what we thats what were all about were all about spurs the main man on the the main man on the thumbnail and big week for us fixture wise and weve just watched us play galatasaray with which is slightly awkward it didnt feel ideal but firstly before we go well touch on that but how are you doing bakeer you right good mate all good its im on co palmer watch which is a weird one for me because ive also got double arsenal defense like i want palmer to play and i see want him and i want him to beat arsenal as well to be fair but im like also if he doesnt play do that make me better or worse im not even sure but yes fairly big weekend fairly big captaincy choice yes and an opportunity to talk tottenham and to be fair like we are pure spurs bias and dont have the great historical ranks and so forth but last season so t where did you finish last season 1 1839 of course that was a season that created fpl ch but we spent like i want to say like 30 game weeks in the top 100 were fluctuating from second to 10th for a few weeks and just shared a journey had a bit of buzz did you did you think you did you think you had a chance to win it i genuinely from the bottom of my heart everything was going in my way i genuinely thought i was gonna win it all but come game week i think 30ish flop the wild card i was like ah maybe its not my season you do need that bit of luck in the in the running to make it to make it happen and i know we spoke to jamie when he won it and i think it was like gw 34 he did a couple of things that just looked a bit strange but he brought like kdb in and then capped him in 36 when he got the massive 60 pointer for him and and that rocketed him and then never looked back from there so you do need you do need things in those final weeks to go your way you need to be a sub optimal manager im not going to lie thats why i got quite a bit of criticism i can completely understand im doing things that normal people wouldnt do and its working out its just a bit of luck and timing as well and it be calculating a small bit of your look but you have to roll the dice to have a chance when you up there did you feel like you did at some point you realized that you were taking a lot of risks and got there and then when you were like could i win did you take more risks or did you did you change anything during because a lot of eyes were on you suddenly for being where you were for that did you feel like that changed one how you felt about like how you played and two like what was the pressure like and did you even enjoy it i genuinely think thats what made it enjoyable was the fact that i could do whatever i wanted and for some reason it would work at the time like i genuinely felt like a madman like it was so weird its like it revolved around me no matter what i done like esally pascal gross like that was his breakout season for brighton i want to say he was phenomenal he was coming up with everything but little things throughout the season every single week were just slowly gravitating towards me in terms of how enjoyable it was i would say like the initial stage i get my twitter account rolling start making a youtube channel its all very exciting you get to speak like to people all over the world and people like ye start popping up that part is enjoyable but then it gets to a point where its like ah there all always a on you and things stop going your way which is normal you expect that and then you feel a bit more pressure and a small bit anxious on a weekly basis so good to be grounded this season im currently sat at 15m but i enjoy the season just as much as any other and im looking forward to see if we can top it thats what thats what we need thats what were waiting for were waiting for that one breakout season where we can go right were in the top 100 and then and then we just get a ton of followers from all from all of that were trying to thats what were waiting for we waiting for it for a while i dont know whether its ever going to come but might be a while it might be it might be a while especially if i for me anyway if i keep doing things like bringing in matas nunes in a week where i probably should be bringing in salah wow but that is so captain spurs all captain spurs i think i think thats it theres theres theres so many different people are on so many different paths at the moment youve got people who are sitting on harland wondering what to do without salah youve got people sitt on salah bind harland well they have well they have both you got some people that are sitting there with a wild card coming up in a weeks time as well theres a theres a big fixture swing about to happen for a number of teams there quite a lot i think theres a lot of focus on like what our teams are going to be for game week 11 but i think a lot of what the decisions that you make other than if youre wild carding i think revolve on what youre going to do from 12 onwards funny enough so as much as we look at the fixtures this weekend and spurs is the fixture that everyones looking at for obvious reasons and i forgot to put in the slide about the was it the huddle graphic showing like the xg plot i forgot that ill put it in at some point when you guys are talking but so there is a definite mismatch theres its its pretty obvious itp switch its tot switch it switch away from home this season like its quite a step change theyve had some hard fixtures but 16 xg theyve conceded away from home the most goals conceded with 13 its its quite comfortably as well i think leicester and next are like 14 and then southampton at 12 like its its big the other stuff is when you look at their away stats as well with whips which they havent pressed at all away from home theyve sat back and youre like i dont know how thats going to the best way to get a to the moment is to press them high themselves and try and turn the ball over but theyve theyve allowed teams to press them highly is again it all just looks like a delicious fixture and we are a home team like we are having big issues away from home continually it feels like teams have worked us out a little and are able to try and exploit that at home for some reason when they come to the big stadium is broken should be back up now were brok im not broke well get a comment in chat saying were lagging but then it will come straight back amazing so it felt like some i said he put some put some runs in but realistically like it felt like it would just didnt want to be there and im like i dont know how many minutes were going to get out some on the weekend cut out again no just trying to pick it up now are we back you should be back should be back how many minutes so was a qui so chai you challenged us there go on how many minutes are we saying im going to say 70 75 for me adam i think 75 is fine and i think thats enough i think thats enough cu i think game should be done and dusted by then if theres anything that we know about spurs is the first 15 to 20 minutes that second half is where things can happen and if hes on the pitch for the first half then great so i think that works fine for me i think what we have seen from ag is the substitutions a little bit pain by numbers a little bit in some of the some of the some of the minutes for example so it definitely feels like he trusts the sport science said guys so if they say sun 75 if were if its nil itll still take him off on 75 if its 5 nil itll take it off from 75 what its not like sometimes substitutions or the minutes that we see every weekend are a lot game state related for example if theyre not winning harlands always playing 0 is if its three or four goals in the back well thats probably the time where he gets the rest so i dont think suns one of those where its like 75 minutes if he comes off in 75 minutes its because hes done all the damage and if they hadnt done the damage yet hell play to the end i dont think that is the case with i think like we saw last week with the villa game like he looked like he was about to explode in that game and then just get saing off because and just like no thats the minutes i think especially when you consider the setback hes after foret theyre trying to put a cotton blanket around him now especially so id be more than happy with subing them off regardless of the game state like you said hopefully see mikey moore get 15 20 minutes i love that virus you just be he just be resting up bit of oofin warm blanket and itll be fine by the weekend youd assume wouldnt you unless hes got like angela fever type thing it sounded like well phil ability for it so we think that minutes rons out so sanki minutes solid youd think night minutes for salanki wouldnt you i would say so i think thats why i would lean towards the sank captaincy im sure well get onto it over sunny i dont know if you had son do you have son one and if you had son and you had the pair who would you be more likely to show the ar so me and adam have got both got slank and son okay full bias warriors youve got have you got both ive got salanki you got salanki but not son i am im in same position i would captain sank over some this weekend i think my battle is salanki v salah not s v salah this weekend i would agree with that 100 fair enough what about you i dont know i think i prefer i think i prefer son i just think i adam by the way if adam says fair enough it means he what he means is i dont agree a little bit i dont know why he says fa off tell us what you mean tell us tell us well i know that you a week ago said to me that you wouldnt triple captain harland over salah because the midfielders are so good and they telling me that you want to go for the striker over in spurs instead of the midfielder so im not im not because im currently on sal because i still think the midfielders are the options for it but there is the question in the chat if what if you had salanki and brennan noank i think for me what edges it is especially now that im ejected in my own mind 70 minutes for sun let say slank is on penalties for 20 25 minutes if in that case and we dont get many penalties not to say one as you but somewhere in my mind im like thats more appetizing than captain and sun for me we dont get any penalties because we dont because we dont have the profile of winger thats going to drive into the box and take people on we have the profile of winger thats going to cross early and the other winger is just going to be standing on the six yard line so either get he might get fouled but not many not many defenders make rash challenges in that area of the pitch normally the winger just taps it in so the pens thing im not sure i put any weight on it for spurs personally thats valid we dont get any like exactly as you said oogi and brenan both of them they make the they make the runs the driving runs that go past everybody else and they tend to just hit it first time they tend to just drive it across first time that said i did watch i did watch salah absolutely rinse leaf davis i know that was a while ago now but like defensively leaf davis is not going to be hes not going to be up to brennans pace so it could be a week where he does well might back might just back it as an anytime goal score and just leave it at that the out ofed the hell out of it you cant lose then exactly i just i wouldnt c brandon over the others i think its i think its unpredictable what well see from him i definitely think hell have hell definitely have a big chance thats what you definitely almost know where brenon is he finds ways to have a big chance youd expect that against i witch as well but even if he seems to have a big chance its very rare that brennan also gets top bonus as well because he works in limited touches like his is his thing is not to pass the ball around his thing is not to even cross the ball very often his thing is to just arrive in the right place and tap the ball in del ali sty its the old school like type baseline as well like six or seven like its just its never its its so unlikely to be enough compared to what were seeing from the m suns creativity at the moment thats that is the best thing about with sun is that youve got huge amount of cre creativity i think the thing with son that i worry about is its almost too cre like that hes much more disciplined than brenan in terms of he will stay on his wing absolutely i think especially this season i dont know why its quite interesting to watch because hes so relaxed and he mightnt be in the game for periods of the game and suddenly hell do something like we were used to seeing like wow hes still there at 32 or whatever i think hes 32 do you still think hes got it do you think hes at you think hes past the peak of his paris i think he knows his game more i think it is that bit that weve seen it with like those mature guys were seeing it with leowski at barcelona now in that sense of those guys dont lose it they just know their games more and i think he knows this game more is if they want to offer width hes just unlikely to beat people with 20 30 yard runs so he just holds his position more than anything else hes creating space for others and his creativity like his creativity is just get better and better the cross last week for the brennan go was fantastic i dont i dont hate the sunat i dont but i dom would edge it for me at the moment in terms of from the spurs guys and i just dont know if i like those more than i like liverpool fair enough i think i did manage to put this together just in time just to just to show that xg difference city top of that with about plus one plus 95 something like that spurs in second at about seven something like that and then i switch down at minus 11 and thats its its quite clear and as much as you saw i wouldnt take todays game against galatasaray as a yard stick for how te well realistically how were going to defend however we are possibly going to be missing our two center backs on on the weekend like you were you were talking about porro bringing in por po this week baker like how is it is it today thats maybe called that slightly well i think i think romero is going to be okay i would not be surprised at all if romero plays and id be surprised if madison plays so we are we are looking at par set pieces we have ip switch are without greaves like its their best header im just trying to work out who would win who would win headers for us just dom somehow ben davies wins so more h than any man ive ever seen he misses them all but like somehow he seems to always win the header thats there dragon can win a header romer and dom can but i do expect for at least 70 minutes of the game that par set pieces no thats fair which does tempt me whereever you want to use a transfer again still on defenders at the moment defenders are just so painful of whether id want to use one there and youre using youre bringing a guy in that youre almost certainly just going to bench next week against m city i me ive got 18 and a half million in my starting defenders at the moment its painful its painful when i have 13 and a half it be i feel a lot more comfortable exactly im not im not ruling out that if i looked at still what parro versus say dow because i think theyre probably the two there like dow canate and parro all very similar prices that five to five and a half million i look at them i think i like him i love that al one i was going to bring him up especially when this new maner comes in he plays five the back and i think under 10 hag weve seen dow play so advanced itll always tend to keep clean sheets throughout the season i dont know how they do it doesnt matter how good or bad they are theyll always keep some clean sheets and of course the favorable fixtures h coming up so i do like that one if theres a if theres a if theres an entry point its these two games right its it is these two games absolutely for sure and i think theres even theres even opportunity to have him as a make play for or maybe not dow but if youre looking to get into the midfield theres possibilities to get into get in and out of manual assets just for a couple of games and theres people talking about hland as well which is fair again im looking for me harry just in the chat doesnt sun take some set pieces weird so sun looks like direct free i imagine direct free kicks is probably going to be sun over por probably if madisons not on the pitch game before last i did not notic that i think it was when madison went off the pitch that sun did take some corners but last game that was straight back to parro now maybe you might say it was well he had tight hamstrings and whatever therefore he didnt get him to take the set pieces but it looked like they just gone back it did look like porro was only taking them from the left side wasnt he it was mainly kosi was out on the right one orbe they always did that short corner to parro they love that dont they love it love it they love it so i think the majority of the stuff will still be through par should we get the fixtures up we can look at the fixtures first of all got say hello to everyone in the youtube chat so shout out to you guys for joining us and watching us maybe youve just got us in the background white or youve got us in the foreground and youve got man united in the background thats what were hoping thats what were assuming you dont need to listen to the commentary you can listen to us thats cool so shout out to you and as always shout out to crypto blown for his support for the podcast we appreciate it weve got a couple of weeks to go until the fca so for anybody that did vote for us thanks for that looking forward to that you you tried your suit on today didnt you baker i tried i am a man thats been working at home for the last eight years and when i do go to the office its a very modern type office you wear chinos polo shirt that type of world i havent put a suit on for yes at least i reckon i reckon its at least 8 i was trying to what play back through in my head somehow got a wider back how do you get a wider back as you get older i dont even know thats possible cuz i could get my trails up but i was like my god im have to go suit shopping this weekend im have to do it this week because the was away next weekend amazing we can we can sure look at fixtures but while were looking at fixtures people have got to make sure they hit that like button if they enjoy what theyre watching sl listening to and and make sure you subscribe if you want to see more from us heading towards 9k subs want to get to 10k im hoping were arranging like a decent sized giveaway for 10k so we just pop that in there as a little cherry so make sure you subed because its going to be for anyone thats subbed there might be some other teas and sees around that but it will be for subscribers and we have as you we have to grind it cuz we aint going to get there by being number two in the world mr chai no well get there dont worry twice a week begging no were not begging but lets look at some lets look at some games so as always we look at the data that comes from rob t the data that comes from spreadex and were looking at expected goals in a particular matchup as well as a percentage chance of a clean sheet big ticket items spurs weve spoken about and with the highest percentage chance of a clean sheet this week 38 and then were looking at united at home to leicester 245 with a 36 chance of a clean sheet so like second and then youre looking at liverpool third with 235 and 32 chance of a clean sheet once again like not many games where were expecting to see cleans and theres lots of one ors and two ons hanging around all over the place wherever you go no 40 whatsoever none like 40 so are like yes over 40 you can start thinking theres a good chance of it none 38 in spurs might as well be 20 to be honest thats what its bad like when we are nearly topping it like liable defense this weekend what youre in some trouble so let me pos some questions to you lets go to the defense lets do the defense stuff r leis if you got him have we all got him ive got him y do you play him not at the moment you got about 12 so you got you got some options ill ill sit back you been leaf davis last week so i cant start mikeno over lewis the upside of lewis is just too high for me to not start where is this upside we keep i keep talking about it but he youre going to score goals he stands in the box a lot right thats thats the big upside isnt it he never nobody ever passes to him but like he stands in the box a lot hes just there hes like a poor mans mos know what like at least mos got the assist last week but thats guy where they just theyre always around but theyre not doing and touching the ball in the right spaces is but you look at this and im like im in similar position where its mikeno is the option if i was to not play him but its whever he gets in the team thats the big question like for me i have no doubt west have im going to score against everton i dont know why its just one of these fixtures where can see goals when i we look at it that way like im not too high on ever and clean sheet its like why wouldnt i start rico lewis even if im worried about his minut i dont know i dont know do you think hell start im 5050 and i think that 50 is hope for i think it start i think it start cu walker was just so bad he i just think in a way though the worst part about them even just midweek was that we keep talking about it the midfield dont track like they do need him to invert a bit more and provide some legs into that midfield because id much rather they were playing three big center backs and then rico was inverting but theyre not doing that much because vardal is clearing off its not like what like its not like when you think about like last season with trent where he sort came in midfield and robertson stayed back as that left center back but the problem is vards so high then you stick rico lewis up there and youre like i just i dont know to be fair whoever its going to be is going to get pinned back because matoma is just going to have whoever it is just you chasing the tail like against porro similar game against trent last week honestly as i said i if canart got injured im sure trent was coming off at our time because he was just mat was just taking the piss ats class hes been class this season as well i thought he so impressive against us he randa shock hes already made an absolute mockery of por and trend this season and i look up against rico ls and im like and know that if hes on the bench hes going to come on 100 so is it is it upside versus meleno i dont know i dont i dont think that i dont think the city will clean this week so im comfortable in benching him for whoever i think well yours isnt forever though whos your other free defenders well my other free defenders are gabrielle porro and trent well yours is not in the conversation youre going to ben im very comfortable b get this all over twinter tw im benching leis this week youre like who is it well ive got probably the best free defenders anyone could got the best fre defenders anyone could have this week okay wa he just said v was not keeping it clean so you true i have got the best three this is true its true ill be we youre not in youre not in the game of mikeno wait i was im never ever im never ever going to be in that game i dont dont get involved with championship defenders you got leaf davis mate i know i know but i dont play him thats true he just there as well for celebrations i know its a bit of a left field swerve but matias has dropped us a super chat so lets just get a big just a quick quick answer for him so he said weve spoken about spurs and weve spoken about united already briefly so pick two out of son salang holand and bruno you want to go first baker whos he asking this to i dont know i dont know whether he can have two mids two strikers do you want one of each well ill just something than you thanks thats i think i go i think i go i think son and salanki i cant i cant say bruno and salanki if im going to captain son over salanki can i thats like just makes no sense whatsoever if its for this week im going salanki and bruno i dont hate that noty but id also prefer to capan harry fpl harry says id play grees versus spurs if i could course you would harry you liar of course to be fair if harry if harry did that hed score he would definitely score thats how thats how this game works we know we know how this game works harry absolutely were familiar with your game harry as soon as you soon as youre plugged in to the official fpl guys and you start getting these so lets look around some other decisions hey i need i need you guys to talk to me about this one ry or fabiany listen this so i on world card e i think it was i you have to pick a second keeper i had joel ward at the time and i meant to put in fabianski and i didnt click save im delighted i didnt because id be having a benching headache with ederson this week i think ederson is probably the favorable one but im happy i dont have a second goalkeeper to mess around with who would i choose in that situation i think it has to be rare 24 chance playing for aral i choose fabianski 28 i me the only risk this is the thing though like for 70 minutes of the game at the weekend he was like the worst keeper of the worlds ever seen and then for the last 20 minutes he was bof on so i dont even know whether hes gonna start but then if hes not going to start it doesnt matter because youre gonna get ry in anyway but i think if youre g to pick the fixure i would pick west ham for this one because betto provided a great example that he also does miss big chances and if like if d plays dcl then you cash money arent you mate exactly whats im gonna play im gna play fabianski im gna bench dcl and dcl is going to score in five minutes against fabianski thats how fpl works baby harrys right if what if palmers if palmers not fit then you play ry thats exactly my point i was looking at it as if palmers not it but if he is fabians one you guys need to carry on for a sec i need to i need to nip out for a sec because my child is still still awake so hopefully the stream stays up fingers crossed but well well find out just a second lets lets do man united you just talked about them and you like the idea of d this week and just in general stats are good but its early were still on rude time before we get to mrm is it too early to go on this week no i think if youre going to do it has to be this week surely well the problems ive got with it is the three players well theres four players i think that are people like d gacho brun and hland and i do have slight question marks over every single one of them about where they sit in the new system because we expect d played left back again tonight probably play who knows where he plays on the weekend but like what if what if amam just says ill play masi right back and i want somebody to play the left and maybe thats even gacho plays left wing back and suddenly its like what do we do with him but we just we dont know and are they are they like such a slam dunk team that i can go well i know what im going to get from d i dont know and then im like well he could also play 3 4 2 1 and is that cuz hes played a lot amim and therefore im like where does bruno sit in that is bruno could be the nine then hes the best player in the game bruno could be in one of the two behind one of the best players in the game bruno could be in the pivot not one of the best players in the game caracho same deal like where is he and that b and oand again same deal like is he the nine thats going to be the one if hes going to be the nine and hes going to everythings going to be about him then hes just a fantastic pick so what youre telling is bruno is the best option probably hes the most reli of those ones he the most reliable i would agree it feels like hes the one where it feels like thats the one that you would go to but the hland one is one its probably hland is one its easy hland and do they easy two for me to get to cuz if wanted to move on lewis or move on dcl and im looking at those guys and thinking maybe i should and maybe i should go this week when its home to leicester we just talked about the worst away xgs and only shortly behind whips which is leicester it depends on your risk appetite though because between now and then youre not expecting much change in the team and even in that first week when he comes in like to think he wont mix it up too much do was too crazy again he easily could but i dont know i do like for sure bruno again i dont know what your stance was h before the season started when he was doing rubbish and then now i was always high on bruno again i dont think he was a bad pick i had him myself and i think go for the season he looks quite good i want to say again you knowed are so theyre such a big question mark on them but again its those question mark players that if you get right theyre what elevate you because people arent on them hes just hes just its the players around him that are causing him the problem its not its not him thats thats the issue hes not getting it was the f the first game against fulham where he gets those two big chances you feel like you feel like if he scores one or both of those then like the season just takes off right and everybody has him and what and it just carries on from strength to strength rashfords finishing has been average gachos finishing is its always average he just hasnt had the supporting acts with him to to make it work hland scored a couple of good goals but again everything just started to go a bit sour at the end of the the ten hog stuff so maybe this is a fresh start maybe this is we dont i dont expect i expect like brunos output to increase it has to like it simply just has to it has to it does it cant be la i agree especially with a player at his standard like he but i dont expect his data i dont expect his expected data to change like i expect that not to not to drop because of a change in a change in management here i dont think thats going to happen i agree with that i think the thing on brunos i expect his xa to go up but his xg will only naturally go up because bruno is bruno is objectively a bad finisher like hes im going to say hes like bottom tier finisher like when hes oneonone you expect him to miss almost every time he gets a shot within the sixyard box but what he is an incredible ball striker so if you look at his goals he misses a ton of 045 xg chances and he scores a load of less than 01 xg chances which then gets him back to up for it so when his overall xg is there but when you look at when you look at the number of chances that he misses that are not 02 03 04 xg its a significant number so he always has bits he will always have parts where he looks like hes massively under his xg and then hey guess what by the end of the season he gets back because he will at some point probably in these next few games score a goal thats like 01 xg its what he does but like we saw it just on the weekend like header he had about 3 n hes going to when he get when through and he was like six yards out with a header theres not theres not a fan alive that watched it that thought hes going to put that in the goal nobody does like he just doesnt but when the ball rolls to him and hes 20 yards out you just think hes going to stroke in the corner i think br has an excellent choice with these next three fixtures and especially i think there were people that planning maybe go palmer this week as an option therell be a few now where theyre thinking well i just got bruno at the moment bruno for a couple and then i me im inan exactly that boat exactly that boat right now if i can if i can find but then the only one the only way for me to find the money is to sell harland and that sucks because its two transfers its a minus four and like you got it last week you i say got away with it but you you managed to cover your hit last week by selling harland but that wasnt a fun experience was it its not fun sorry its never fun have we spoken go on its okay as soon as soon as your soon as youve got scores like as soon as he scores it was fun like it was even if he scored at the end i was like well im not losing now you do need you need your players to hit if you havent got harland and they miss like if they miss but youve got more chance that your players will hit if you dont have harland in your team because the overall quality of the rest of your team is much better because you spend 15m completely agree and that was how i was born last season no one else was going without h it what i was doing man its so mad how it works out but the game is so much more enjoyable for me without him im back with no hland i went i done the move last week with h kuna and salah and i feel rejuvenated again got nice agree now and i cant wait for him to score a hatch versus brighton this week where i dont own him i do know its going to happen but thats exactly the position i felt like straight away the second the previous game we finished was like i want to have my options to have anybody that i want in this game and the best way for me to do that is to not have harland and back yourself that you can pick the players around it that will work hes going to hurt at some point though he is he is sp is just a game in know game wolves assets any other talk about wolves assets because again we got to talk cuz people either have already gone but theyve theyre maybe not sure about the decision theyve made or theres still people looking at whether they should pick kuna or strand lson or like if you want a defender from wolves then its ain nori or nothing but there was something interesting again rob t is just like cracking out smashing out these fantastic fantastic ones was the wrong one this one with the goal shares by game week and its pretty close its pretty close between coa and st lson he does get a higher share generally if they both score if they both contribute then or if they both score then co is getting co is getting the bonus but i dont know whether cabia coming back in makes a difference i dont think so well i think cabia got in all the places that youd want to be in thats a problem like when i look at it and think well and for stran lson if hes got cabia and can putting it on a plate for him then thats good for him full stop like i think hes a good option do you want to double up an attack with both of them this tough is its tough but okay this week its tough but its cheap as well its just how often you can bring yourself to do it because the numbers are still bad now everyones going to say but of course theyre bad cuz the fixtures theyve had and all that stuff but theyre still bad like they are now as an overall lowest in the entire league for xg when would we ever do it when would in any world would we go i want double attack i want both forwards from the worst attack in the league what surely you wouldnt classify wolves as one of the worst attacking teams in the league would you like surely this is a good chance for them to maybe gain some and get back into the 14 15th realm but it also around this though it sways this like this chart will looking at here when theres very small samples its all in pockets because frankly thats the only place its going to if you looked at if you did this with tottenham for example its going to be wider because theres more goals you do it with liverpool you do it in man city like even with man city youll have one big guy but everybody else is quite spread because they creating so much when the teams not created hardly anything its going to be limited where they where they where these play out half it half reminds me of the son kane season that we saw however on on a tear down from there the fixtures the fixtures you can you can build whatever narrative you want around the fixtures because we havent seen fixture run like this before and i dont think they have to run they have to run as probably like the fourth or fifth best team for the next nine weeks to get back in amongst it cuz if they dont theyre still going to be bottom by christmas yes and its whether you trust its whether you trust that they can do that i dont know its its funny that you compared it to son and kane but if p spartans in the chat compared it to emanuel dennis josh king which people did double up on and that worked out they did brilliantly well it only worked out badly because emanuel dennis got sent off in a double trip i had plenty of josh king that season it didnt work out good for me even i seem to remember not having either of them because i said they were bad players from a bad team im not doubling up im not doubling up lets not lets not be around it but then also wolves are not a promoted side no so i think there are worse attacks i know i talked about on sunday i was impressed with how they moved the ball v palace but i also noticed that when someone moves the ball at them like they just they can do what they like thats cool though because i dont i dont have their def im talk me personally like dont have their defense just have their attack then or just have one of their attackers and you can by looks of this you can pretty much pick either one and its probably okay its probably okay its probably okay its probably okay but not both no well look at this look at this is it this is it this projection is here so lets count how many lets count how many people were projected to get more goals than strand lson and then i wish you have asked i wish youd have asked us to do this pre pod because otherwise its going look terrible for the next 30 seconds so 17 players before you get to stran larson and then another seven 24 players so we insane before you get to kuna as the most projected goals this weekend its pretty close were all going to say theres that many but realistically youve got esack at 044 whos what eight from the list down to kun at 37 so its its pretty its pretty minimal in terms of what were seeing there but its not like so home to southampton this is the fixture like danny welbeck home to man city is predicted to get more goals the matas kya thats doesnt sit right with me lad it doesnt doesnt sit right on me at all like look at it this week im like okay whos the highest projected of the sub 65s its chris wood again of course it is its chris wood again its a good fixture for him as well home old club old club old club where you didnt have a great time you want to put all those narratives in there so help me out boys because neither have you got dcl have you no thank god dont pick dont pick bad players from bad teams mate i do the honest list youve got dman neil mate and hes hes not even okay fine okay carry on i dont think championship defenders got i dont got the other one shooting yourself in the foot mate were all stupid in this game but dcl was there and i so if theres a doubt on partner then i feel like i have to move on dcl because rogers is there as an option but if not then i dont know if ill get 11 players out so i feel like probably should just make the move on dcl as my move the more i think about it is probably thats where i should make it and you look at it this week and you say well ive got the money hilands right there 051 did you just attack it with the threee fixtures he hasnt got pens hes probably also limited on minutes wood is right there i almost feel like you get youll make this own narrative in your head though because chriswood has done so well that would almost sade me not to go there its this thing i always do its not the right thing at all it does so the new shiny ty highland might be the one because youre like ive got to try because im like i dont even know why im two and a half million now whatever it is then im like well ive got to try and get past the people that ive got wood so i need to get somebody else exactly what do you need to do in 12 well what would you do in 12 if you were to get chriswood i suspected just son sacka sunant saaka probably just would you bench wood against arsenal because rogers h to palace okay so then because that is the interesting thing with wood is about it is that theres a slight headache if i went oand of like who do i play next week well we dont even know if hland starts next week nam room comes in right no cuz talking brand new manager so because as much as much as it is like just get chris wood because its an easy bench to week and then and then again week 13 i get that get the home to it switch i was going to say whis but probably like the fixtures are pretty much the same cuz brenford are so crap away from home it probably doesnt matter and again 13 is the big leicester home fixture but do i just try and ruin chris wood for everybody so theres another player that we were sp speaking about a small bit in the group chat that is jedro i know adam you brought him up as well would you be more than happy to wait until next week go for a jo pedro even though its a small bit of risk rather than going to a wood its just i still dont know whether jia pedro is better than danny welbeck still i dont think we know that anymore dani ws been so good that i just ru has been good as well i know hes gonna bring hes probably gonna bring him straight back in but rout has been pretty good as well he been pretty good so it doesnt feel like it doesnt feel like he has to throw him straight in and youre right its the game week 13 is the one against southampton at home if youre g to bring him in that week and then theres evan nson down at down at bournemouth i like it but i dont like it enough i dont love it maybe i should just get chris bloody wood it might it might just it might just solve your it might just solve your problems so you dont have to think about it as you say you can bench him next week bench him against city and then the fixtures arent good though like forest fixtures are objectively bad over the next 10 when youve not got harland youve got eight youve got eight decent players this is true rogers fixtures are getting better again now is maybe i need to look at the rotations around rogers and wood but when youve got ive got bumo salah palmer and it be sack or son youre playing those every week salanki and kaa im playing them every week at the moment theres no chance of the picture even the man city game ill play sank all day long in that game small bit off topic but when do you see yourself getting rid of emo or do you well its crazy price now like it is a crazy price but i am i honestly did look at it and was like is bruno is bruno for brian like the worlds worst option for next three theyve got two home games brenford got two home games theres just too much there potentially the eo i well just not even just not even just the eo i just think there i just think theyll create enough big chances in the next two games in the next two out of the next three games i just dont think that like boomer will get a couple of those chances right and bruno wont get those he will be provide hell be more on the creative side just trust boo just trust i think game week 14 i think its a its its a definite consideration option its just trying to figure out who the best person at that fixture when those fixtures get to 14 like what do you what do you do from there well by then foden might be cheaper than bumo so maybe le highway swap you look down at the fixtures in 14 and there are just loads and loads of real crap to be honest its difficult you could do to palmer like that and maybe just get lets do our guest team lets do the guest team you can teams we need do teams and get out were almost at an hour so thats good mr chai i have now changed your name i dont know whether you saw it said har im not harry no more no team you want me to run true for the podcast please mate thatd be great so on goal weve got ederson h treb lewis alexander arnold eight nori h four in midfield muhammad salah in buo garnacho and palmer three up top salanki kuna and hts its not in this image but currently the iron band is on dominic sanki and of course rogers mikeno and greaves on the bench when you sent me the image did it have salanki captain i cant remember so thats on me if so thats on me good so i have 1m or i have one free transfer 18 in a million similar space to you baker originally at the start of the week i spoke on stream quite a bit on last week potentially doing isach for hits and this week i also like that move of course they play first and i think newcastle look a bit sharper than weve seen in those first six seven games and gordon is back playing well so hes definitely w us on my mind another one is upgrading lewis of course of ederson on goal just dont know how much of fancy going into the common game weeks were player that i dont know if hes going to start or not and i just dont fancy playing m mikeno every week like we spoke about other than that eight home fixtures looks absolutely brilliant its funny is it i look at a similar thing i think all of us look at it goes l of home pictures this week but we just looked at the we just looked at the odds a minute ago and its not great like because of week but as soon as you see a lot of homes youre like well im in for a good week here i got these homes so do you think you move habits out i dont know dont feel like weve got anything solid on habits i dont even think he was on the gold the goal list a second ago that we just looked at so i feel inclined s and off that list i feel inclined to move them on but then again i look at fixture next week and the week after it only gets better for arsenal i cant see this dip in form to continue so and i will eventually want the point a piece of that arsenal attack so how i get there is a question for me fair enough what about would you consider benchin hs and looking at someone even for say bodgers like you could get brennan dont do that to me dont be doing that to me im not considered that hes so good at this hes so good at this like seriously every week hes like you consider this im like hold on gacho you got g already that is spicy because then i go into the game week and my team is fairly differential in general i would say i dont think too many have the double up on a nori kuna unless you of course brought in salah like everyone else but i had a strong attack in slanky hland and haris of course i only moved out of but now ive got garnacho with a nice lesser home and especially if i go from rogers that would differentiate the team you have me thinking i dont know though hav if he does play against his old team something nice about it he scored two last time he played him 74 minutes against him he want to be fit looks good and if the fact that od came off the bench sh mod starts big game they need it sh mode starts which means that youd hope i say hope like fre tottenham fans here hope that trossard would drop out and that od would go in and that means that have earth is back at nine as well and it was a cut so you think hes going to be fine couple of stitches or whatever wasnt it be fine or i could just roll i could im in a place where like if i roll no problem i could easily make a transfer no problem like i dont think i need to be too worried about it like on paper it is good what do you do if what do you do if theres news that palmers at then i would definitely be more inclined to make rogers a sixo someone midfielder that gets interesting then how much has he moved in price now for everyone i havent even looked you stick him in at five and then ive never looked at him since who like well when do you want him back and thats like in few weeks time unless you do something wild like find a route to watkins for example its whatever you do want in back when its because it if youre not if youre going to stay without harland for a long time then you might decide you do want more in mfield with a five but i dont know what id get for rogers let me have a let me have a quick look on that one i can stretch to 7m if i take get 52 rogers 52 so i b five its 54 now 52 do who id love if i could do it if i could do this move i would do it a hary and this gordon 72 on point2 off i think gordon isnt being spoke about rightly so because he got an injury recently but i think hes definitely an interesting one and hell be back in conversation soon and the spicy move would be if you did take some money out of havers then a minus four get rogers up to bruno were looking at that now imagine that like double united defense it sounds great its there its there lets see ill need to tamper a small bit more fair enough lets and i dont always say fair enough when i disagree clearly up to you also fair enough we just want to move on thats i have many uses for it i have many uses your teammate so i also have one free transfer 18 in the bank which is probably like a standard amount if you took harland out last week decision in goal fabianski or ry cently got fabianski in there leis a nor and gabrielle of the defense son boomo palmer salah rogers is my current team with salah with the ar as it stands k and salanki up top and at the moment ive got dcl first bench m go second and greaves last sh gavves hopefully will be back after international break i think it makes you more twitchy when youve only got the four defenders and you got that last one youre like god how much am i potentially going to get into that last one despite the fact that my defenders get one point every week so im not sure what that bothered about it especially eno your fourth defender i dont trust i just dont trust c lean enough to start i just think bet done enough so unless d d was d pretty much gave it away last week and they he talked about betto still needs to do a lot of work to get into being a starting player so hopefully he might get ar something similar because if he is starting well i dont know what im saying it because im plan the blood west dam keeper i shouldnt say it was a good fixture but westan does feel like a good fixture so and it sounds like mcneel might be struggling as well whicho think is pretty good for everon so i suspect i take cal l out and im starting to come around to the idea that maybe i should stop trying to be too clever with it and just get chris wood bench rogers i do think though if i chris would in my team would i always struggle to bench him remember again because hes a penalty taken at a number nine probably the same its probably ill probably face into the same pain that i had when i was like cal len where it was like i want to play him every week because hes number nine on pens but at least chriswood scores fair point okay i need to what i need to do is have probably more a look at the fixtures and rotations around rogers and dcr because with the other guys i just dont see myself im going to bench him just dont see it okay so thats me and then up to me you see rogers firmly planted on my bench right at the back right at the back im ready to get hurt there again so ive got johnston in goal at the moment who wont play but its southampton at home so if he does play its a great fixture trent gabrielle porro at the back matas nunes brian son and mcneel dont love that having too many that im not particularly comfortable with and then salanki harland anda up top captain c is currently on sun emmy martinez lewis davis and rogers on the bench it is a bit awkward having you say mcneil and mat nunes there and it feels like if theres an opportunity to take money out ive only got 09 in the bank so theres not many options for me to upgrade and to maybe take some pressure off that midfield i maybe would play lewis or do i just play rogers it probably doesnt matter i should probably just play rogers in fairness which is probably what i need to do is probably play rogers over the one that im not sure about im not sure im going to be making any transfers this week i dont again see a huge amount of upside and going anywhere near any more liverpool this week yes its a home game thats also al why rogers is on my bench because i got trent in defense that mcneil to garnacho mcneil to garnacho option potentially so this is this is the source was joe thomas who said that briman neils a doubt for evertons trip to western this weekend it was set to undergo a final assessment on friday so hopefully some news there its an away game as well and so good chance they might get some traveling news and were a late deadine as well knee injury which hampered his preparations ahead of the game versus southampton last weekend has since flared upir flare up doesnt sound flare up doesnt sound too bad adam ice pack where do you stand with tren its not one that a lot of people are speaking about i think a lot of people that owner are more than happy to hold them do you want more are you happy to how hes done so far im fine with what hes done so far just but i dont think hes worth the money that ive paid for him or got in him at all so would you would you be looking going forward to get rid of him thats what im trying but the problem the problem is i want to get rid of trent i want to get rid of porro i want to get rid of nunes mcneel and lewis and then i want to do a hokey koke on rogers and get rid of harland so its its its difficult when youve only got one free transfer to make seven so ive got to try and pick my battles trent going to be the one thats going to free out the most money well no harland will but trent front but trent fre is up three million not three million well maybe three million two and a half million immediately anyway so it just feels odd going down to canate i just it just feels like a weird move i think if you havent got canate i think if you havent got canate and youre looking for that price bracket mid defender i think its a pretty fine move but when youve already got trent and youre its going to go canate it just feels a bit weird so it might be the one though because its its 17m that gives me enough to take mcneil to bruno for example honestly the way i see canate versus tren at the moment is canate has an opportunity to score on every corner that liverpool get but trent has the only has the ability to return on half of them is cans in the box for every single one of them but trents only taking one side like it and you get double the points if you score them now van dyks there as well blah but doesnt mean its can score them all but i dont think its a huge loss at the moment to have canate i dont and i would spend less time thinking about that move and more time thinking about the yes if i you offered me for example if you offered me son and tren or you offered me salah and canate then probably go sorry i said get son and trent or sal and canate i have son canate forward not this weekend if you thats i think thats fair enough in isolation i think looking at the rest of the team i dont think its its not doesnt feel like a problem area no but the only way youre going to address the fact that youve got three five million pound midfielders is to sell the big guy you cant you cant and he he has to go by he has to go in 12 like whatever so so whatever happens he has to go in 12 and do i think its because 12 can be 12 versus tottenham hes gone for that hes gone for that r going to put him on his ass its fine the question the question does come back on these ones is can you do it c can you do it with free transfers or do you just do it with hit i probably need a hit either way like i probably need a hit i dont mind a hit but if i do it this week i probably take four points and then i take probably another four points next week i probably take eight anyway if you looked at this week and said expected points on say harland and one of the midfielders that you dont want either mcneil or nunes who would you bring in this week if you were to switch that around salah and which striker thats the thing like the problem with the strikers this week is that all the strikers feel like id want to get off them again very quickly whereas i think next week i can look at i can see about xia pedro welbeck i can im one fixture further away from a good chris wood fixture and im one fixture further away from wiissa and im one fixture further away from say stran larson so therere the difficult ones so maybe it is this week maybe is maybe it is gambling on the fact that i dont i dont know in brighton next week i dont know that we gain anything from brighton versus man city that gives us info to know which is the best brighton stroker for the better games no thats thats thats thats also well at least p j pedro playing would might be a might be an indicator thats definitely that might help thats definitely a bonus but i think i think i think it does look inevitable that you are going to have to take the plunge probably on holland with 35m powerman fielders and palmer and salah with pretty decent pixture bs yeahs how much money can i get down from har i cant if i take harand like matas is only 49 so its difficult to get very far up there well you can still switch harand holland mat for example is still cheaper than salo and any striker under 7m yes then i cant do anything with mcneil id like to almost do two but can i how many ch i know i know then because then im taking out trent at that point as well and then when then it gets to like i dont know 1 am on saturday morning then im bringing in knows who like who knows at that point palmer and 12 is going to be the one isnt it even if you sell this week it would be what do i do what do i do to get palmer and 12 where if you roll you can work it out well it mean getting palmer and 12 would involve like trent and sun well not if you dont go salah not if i dont go salah so if i went bruno then so like i think in 12 for example like i think watkins i think watkins starts to get better again come past 12 absolutely z watkins say again isach or watkins i think isach and watkins get better but i like i like watkins post the international break i look at it i think the home palace games good game so potentially likes what harland and nunes becomes watkins and palmer for free and then works all around a bit palmer can cover a lot of the salic caps he cant theyve got theyve you got theres going to be decisions to make when theres games like 12 is a decision to make on palmer versus salah its a big old decision southampton or leicester we can we can leave that convers we can leave that conversation for a few weeks we can leave that conversation for a few weeks so thank you to everyone in the chat make sure youve hit the like button before you leave today theres questions any questions not any questions what are your thoughts on lewis versus vardal tempted to make the move between the two the sideways thats a luxury move sounds very luxury not sure id be making that no im not sure i be making it i dont like the fixtures i dont like the i dont like the clean i think vs been an incredible pck and i think hell still continue to be like if you think that youre going to have viio as a longterm hold to 38 then i think its okay but i look at it and think the next four or five weeks i dont think i want viio like id rather take the chance on someone like d like you said well get ca back is ca back on the menu soon ben white maybe something like that maybe that might come up chelsea winning 8 nil apparently christoper and kungu back on the score sheet two for felix as well its good because they dont they dont play at the weekends so colin johnson says remember guys saints only considered one goal at city when everyone was talking about triple captain harand wolves might be a tight game id imagine southampton approached that game a little bit differently i would assume so to as well i think southampton will still get to play though like southampton we have seen when theyve gone out and play they like they can move the ball and i think what we saw in that palace walls game last week was both teams were just trying to move the ball so i do think theyd be goals i think it will be will be pretty different and how they are ive just noticed in game week 12 that palmers the first game of the game week at half1 12 the f is saying dont say everybodys going to c in salah because hes on sunday just wait dont tell anyone everybody is gonna captain salah because hes on sunday would you play rogers this week or smith row didnt even talk about fulham but we didnt talk about monday nights game at all who f got palace exactly dont like but thats for me phil are making some decent chances what if what if harry wilson scores a braak and then just starts ahead of him this weekend though thats a good point did just score a brak like he could easily just walk in and take that place its probably still my thr just i probably play smith row madison to bruno absolutely in a hobby ryan football chat box says hello last couple of questions hello to you ryan question for chai how long do you intend to keep g atro for and whats your favorite type of tea okay so this is a brilliant question how long am i going to hold g atual for i think it depends on what we see from amaron when he comes in the obvious answer for me is 14 because they play against arsenal but again it depends on the situation if suddenly united are drawing against leester and nips wi i think i could bin them off and ever if it comes to it in terms of my favorite tea mint tea is my favorite and the reason is is because it balances your hormones there you go very good never get you never get you never get positive health stuff on here other than your life helps there you go there you go if it helps my two favorite tees are mint and chai so perfect there you go the both last question from sally well okay well ill do the adams as well because hes shares the same name as me so that would be terrible if i did not include him sally says captain salah on or salanki thats what were talking about its all three of us so lets lets talk it im currently on mo ch youre currently on salanki thats right and im currently on currently on son there you go perfect so were completely split good luck would you play whist or seeno a wher id play seeno you play seeno over whis okay im not sure i dont agree with that i just bford at home isnt it brenford at home for me i play wi okay were two1 there no worri sally you just got here you can rewind and watch everything if you want but thats fine because wes plan against fleen though sorry ss plan about planning against fleen he was excellent for 91 and a half minutes was he on monday when you ruined his clean she ch did you see that did you see the i did but did you see the did you see the messages that baker was we were talking on whatsapp okay so adams the dark side in our world in this one in the i was saying i dont mind the fleck and clean sheet because jimenez would gone off whist had gone off smith row had gone off i was like as long as they all blank i dont mind i dont mind the fleck and clean sheet thats offset by boom get his fre points hell be fine i was fine about that adams like no i want i want i want misery all round absolutely hes on three hes on three bonus he was like three save points i was like hes going to lose his clean and lose all his bonus i want minus seven points off flecken please as they kept doing those p roller shots at fleen i was getting annoyed about it myself because i was just like youre just giving him save points what are you doing for it so i was like i said something like let them dream get the wipe out in 0 in the 92nd minute and i said that with like 25 minutes to go 25 minutes a half an hour to go and it happened bang on 9 thanks the first thing i looked at no joke the first thing i looked at was not my phone when the goal went in the first thing i looked at was the time it was instantly because knew were in injury time so the goal goes in i look at the time 9130 and im like this is amazing just text baker started doing it and they people started showing screenshots of their 12 pointers and all that stuff and then best thing ever when it dropped to when it dropped to like seven points whatever i was like ah still okay though is it and then four you were like its funny that was the worst thing about the worst thing about the the winner was he loses he goes down and loses all of his bonus in that moment because he was still top bonus after conceding the first one so he lost all his bonus annoyed the fact that he had the bonus well its just man just volume of saves and stuff wasnt it but the fact that he lost the bonus looked amazing until and hes like he was like 20 owned and then until you realize that robinson got the assist and he was like 25 owned so like the three points just went the other way i cannot believe how high the ownerships were in that monday night game throwing like a third of teams we havent had a good monday night football in a while now you say that ah the game we play the game we play the games
