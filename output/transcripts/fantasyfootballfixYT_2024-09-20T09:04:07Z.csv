hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix youtube channel happy friday or happy saturday depending on when youre watching this and welcome to another episode of eddie versus the algorithm the series here on the fantasy football fix channel where im taking on the computer generated algorithm team for each game week of the 2425 season putting it up against my own drafted free hit team for the week and were seeing who can come out on top over the course of 38 game weeks and so far the algorithm has drawn level is now 22 after four game weeks to be honest pretty much a stinker from both sides last time out as was the case for a lot of fbi managers unfortunately harand captain on both teams so neutralized out it was a onepoint victory for the algorithm in the end so a very tight victory but a victory nonetheless for the computer predicted points scoring team lets see if it can do the same again and get one over me as we move into having a look at both of the teams for game week five so updated score at the bottom of your screen as you can see that is now 22 the algorithm is predicted 62 points for this game week and to try and a achieve or outscore that prediction it has put together this side in goal is going to be going with the blugan of brighton who i think its a pretty good defensive option at the moment that not many people are talking about in regards to the 45m goalkeeper category personally there are other options that i prefer and maybe even for this game we alone i think forest have looked pretty good as a side maybe more so defensively than going forward but i still think that there could be goals in this game for forest there are other keeper options at that 45 mil bracket that i maybe refer long term youve got your robert sanchez at chelsea youve got fleen at brenford youve got other options there too so ban is one that you could go for if youre looking for a keeper option on a gw six wild card and one that seems to be nailing down his spot a little bit more this season theres always been that linger threat of jason steel and thats been the reason to stay clear of brighton keepers over the last year or so in fpl but if he emerges as the first choice and holds his place out in the premier league then a brighton keeper option i can see you going for worse and as much as i think there could be goals in this one for forest it wouldnt overly shock me if that one came out being a nil or maybe just a one nil narrow win for brighton as they look to bounce back so into defense then and lets see what the back three is looking like weve got luca de in there alongside the two liverpool fullbacks of trent and robo so lca de a player who is getting a lot of attention and as one whos been noted down as myself in the past as a historic fpl troll that i will never go near again however it is difficult to ignore him when hes seeming to start every game even with some assigning matson coming in and being subbed off the bench around the 70 minute mark most games he is still as said getting some very nice expected assist data coming off maybe even sometimes hell be banking a clean sheet where villa go on to then maybe concede late and so there is an appeal there with the champions league starting that was where i thought it might get interesting for the left hand side of that villa defense will matson start in the champions league but we saw luca dean start and play almost all of the game in the champions league so could maybe matson be in line for his first start of the season at the weekend we dont know therell be better villa sources to go from than myself but itll just be pr ition for now luca deine isnt nailed that is the key highlighting thing to take away but if he is going to beain first choice for the star of the season and start every game and make the 60minute mark then it is hard to ignore him and villa has some great fixtures coming up where im sure hell be in the competition to get more assists so as much as i want to ignore him and say hes a trash option dont go near him hell troll you he might not and he might be good hes just set up in that position where he could easily troll you again so im steering clear for now i should say the two other liverpool fullbacks i think are great options to go for bournemouth could have something in this game easily but liverpool do still have a few nice fixtures coming up theres a bit of a swing where i think people are looking to offload salaf for saaka and all that kind when weve got the fixture swing in a few game weeks for arsenal game week six i should say is when that fixture swing occurs but trenton robo have still looked decent not eyering attacking numbers truth be told and they are both at risk minutes wise this season a little bit more with conor bradley simas maybe coming on a bit later but i think that trent and robo are still very dependable options for now not going to be in as many teams youll see from next game we onwards when people scuffle to try and get the likes of gabrielle in but bournemouth at home could be a nice fixture for them bournemouth have impressed me attacking wise so i cant say im that confident of a clean sheet in this one but you imagine that trent and robo with how attacking they have been should be in line for an attacking return or two soon so even if they dont keep a clean sheet in that one maybe theyll come away with something up the other end of the pitch into midfield then and its no surprise that mosalah is taking the captain zamb band for the algorithm team this week i could have predicted that a mile off and some big funds being spent in this midfield with humon and co palmer in alongside salah as the three premiums in here weve then got e and then morgan rogers rounding off the midfield so interesting to see rogers in there a player whos yet to get an attack in return well he got was it one assist maybe this season so far i cant even remember theres been so many big chances so many big chances created with him its hard to remember one that has resulted in a goal and not him missing or whoever he passed the ball to missing but you have to say that he is getting in good areas hes playing a lot of minutes he seems nailed on in that aston villa side and for what is it 515m you cant go wrong with a villa asset at that cheap price to try and maybe just cover oy watkins even it seems like such tremendous value and i think he will come good with regards to all his xg and xa that hes been wasting or other players have been wasting i think it just cant continue and hopefully hell get one attack in return soon thatll be a big boost for confidence and then villa will start to finally find their form like we saw last game where they started to put the ball in the back of the net sa against man utd is an interesting one not one of the weakest defenses in the league right now by any strength of the imagination i think that youve got aarte coming in now who i imagine will start this one away at palace at the weekend after being used in midweek in the cup and i think thats going to be a big boost lick has looked good since coming in as well i think hes been a great addition to that man utd backline whether or not theyre able to go to somewhere like palace which hasnt always been the easiest of trips for united in the past and get something there with a clean sheet will be a different question and i think that palace are still looking okay going forward and when they are doing stuff going forward as and meta you have the are the ones that you want to target in attack theres a big thing with a now that youll probably see other people mention but with the penalty situation him and meta are almost now joint takers who are going to decide on the pitch based on player confidence like a sacka odard situation that we have at arsenal and so that limits his appeal very slightly due to the fact that hes not always going to be on penalties and when youre looking at a team like palace who maybe dont score quite as many goals penalties can be a bigger factor than maybe at some of the biggest top six s per se and then weve got palmer son and salah so a lot of fun spent here but why not if the algor had budget spent over these are some of the best fpl assets in the game son hasnt impressed me lately but brenford at home is a very good fixture and i think spurs could do pretty well in that one with salanki back i also like him as a onewe punt as well weve then got palmer at the 10m mark i think nailed on chelsea attacking option hasnt looked quite as good as last season in my view saying that he could easily cut mountain and bag another four attacking returns in one game now west ham have looked all right at home defensively in my view but i still think i back chelsea in that one to grab at least one or two goals and then salah doesnt need much discussion didnt look great last time out of course but i think liverpool rarely look poor two games on the trot and i think in a bournemouth home game when youve got harland and sacka facing off against each other hes going to be the standout captaincy pick and then up front for the weve got oe watkins lining up alongside jamie vardy and jamie vardy is an interesting one i think that hes one that ive seen a lot of talk around this week whether or not hes a good option to bring into your team and this is the thing where i would head over to the op the stats tool on fantasy football fix hopefully you guys can see this but ive ordered this by fpl points per 90 so how well these players are performing per 90 you can see vardy two rows up from the bottom hes played 330 minutes so far this season so a pretty significant number compared to some of the other numbers you see here youve got watkins only two 72 so far youve got jaia pedro 262 some of these players have just missed one game but 330 for vard isnt insignificant despite the notion that hell be hell be labeled with old not playing that many minutes he is still getting a decent number at least to start the season off in terms of points per 90 hes on 518 but he is in theory outscoring his expected data with his expected fpl points just to the left at that number 420 so when you order bu this expected fpl point hes not inside the top what is it 11 or 12 you have here hes even below alexander isach hes on the second page alongside the likes of munice who have stunk the gaff up so far so the datas not there to suggest vard hes not even reaching the levels of xg of antonio or munice and when youve got someone like a calvat luin here who could equally offer an option at 59m so only two2 million more i think that he might be the better pick youve got maybe more of an injury risk prone player in calber luen but if you go chooseing between the two and youre looking at those expected numbers and even the outperformance of fpl points per 90 calv lein is up there with the likes of j pedro and i think youve got two players there at the same price point welbeck as well who is in that price bracket too who just probably are slightly better options for me than jamie vardy now the algorithm is looking at a onee team im talking a little bit about further than this theyve got everton at home who have been just seeming to score two and then just capitulate at the back in defense and they have got a weakened back line they are missing players i dont think that theyre going to keep a clean sheet this week against leicester and i think leicester will score but im just thinking more long term with the nice fixures that everton have coming up is vardy the long best longterm pick for you the algorithm clearly thinks at least on a onewe basis vardy is the player to go for in that fixture between everton and leicester rather than calvin le and then finally well just take a look at the bench which has got lewis dunk fece and stewart on there and now well have a look at my team because im conscious this video is going on quite a lot already but im hope that was useful and just taking a bit of a deep delve into like picking out one asset in the team let me know if you like that or not in the comments i can easily do that or not do that next week depending on how you guys respond to it so lets have a look at my side now so not too long on this one my team does look rather different though ive gone with the not forest events ive gone with ss rather than going with veran so the other goalkeeper in that fixture i have kept luk goodine in for one week surely he cant troll me that much in one game week ive got some cover on the bench in minkovich if needed so that would be a double up on the forest defense if he ends up coming in stuck with trent then ive gone with davis at ipswitch who i think has been on decent amount set pieces looking very attacking iwi have some nice games coming up southampton are a stinky team so happy to have him in for that one ive then gone with luis diaz in midfield ive stuck with salah palmer and sell or so ive decided to go for them myself same as the algo just cuz i had money left over and then lewis diaz who came off early last week when liverpool was struggling hopefully maybe liverpool will be one or two up in this game already and wont be desperate to get gakpo on that left hand side so with jot and diaz the issue at the moment is minutes im hoping di maybe grab two attacking returns before he comes off the pitch in this one and bank the clean sheet liverpool can seeed later on maybe and then finally up front ive gone with watkins captain instead ive gone with vardy still and ive added in calv leen for the reasons i mentioned before with rogers dropped down onto the bench so why have i gone for ole watkins captain lets have a discussion about that now and theres not much more to be said than this is simply eye test and hunch is that what im going on with the watkins captain 5 7 predicted points for this game week isnt a great total at all youve got salah way ahead of him on 77 and palmer and harland not that far behind on 54 53 a piece so its clear who the algorithm and the computer system is backing wolves at home dont look like too bad of a defense either youve got bournemouth looking weaker 161 expected goals conceded for them compared to wolvess 149 and if youre looking fixture wise palmer could be the strongest option with west hams expected goals con seeded so far this season at 218 per9 youve then got an xg of the teams liverpool looking like theyre likely to score more goals man city very close behind there and then palmer and watkins a little bit further back so sorry if you heard any noise outside there by the way ive got my window open because its quite warm in here and theres people slamming gates and stuff so apologies about that and then finally the expected fpl points at an individual no har leading the way but wkins is not too far behind he is in second 94 r seems to be finally able to put the ball in the net regain maybe a little bit of that confidence that we saw from him last season and at the euros and thats what im backing on him to cash in on a lot of that xg put away some more of those chances maybe the ones that morgan rogers even has created for once would be a nice change and thats why im taking the slight punt and going with him as my captain so thats going to be the end of this weeks video hopefully you have enjoyed it may your arrows be green for game week five and hopefully ill see you in the next one goodbye
