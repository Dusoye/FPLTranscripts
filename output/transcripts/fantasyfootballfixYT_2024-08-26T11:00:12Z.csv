hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel with me tom cam you can find me on xly tc and weve got mark mansfield back for another elite team reveal video ahead guys of game week 3 and marks already having another kickass season its no surprise to me im sure itll be no surprise to you either so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel and mark welcome back to the first video for you and the actual season weve got through preseason and look at this mate youre already into that top 200k cruising teach us teach us your wage mate you got to be buzzing with that start yeah hi tom hi everybody yeah really pleased with that its solid sometimes you have a good week one and then your team is over fit to that game week one set of fixtures and your game week two brings you back a bit but ive ive had a good week again i think 100 177000 the last time i checked so yeah so far so good 180 into the season gone so wont count to any chickens or anything that no chickens to be counted just yet but its got to feel awesome to get off to a good start mark you and i were talking off camera do you think this is one of your best ever starts after admittedly only two game weeks can you recollect the time when youve youve surged to this overall rank after two game weeks yeah i normally take some screen caps of my rank the ranks went during the season i normally take them at the end of the season and i just found three there while i was talking to you and after game week two 390000 690000 and 360 so yeah this is probably better than average normally my rank in a given season could start out around here or a little bit worse and then i deteriorate slowly until i panic into doing my wild card and then pick up from there but ive said it before on previous seasons on here im looking for 100000 around the turn of the year yeah you have to that yeah i think im not sure how thats going to be this season because theres not going to be the same scope for massive rank changes if we dont have the big double game weeks this season due to the fa cup so maybe you need to be in a good pos a better position at christmas yeah this year thats cool i was going to ask you around should we be paying any attention to overall rank at this stage of season mark and you can speak from a position of strength now and in your top 178k right now is it is it something that we should be worried about for those folks who havent made such a good start i wouldnt get too bent out of shape if youre if you started badly theres a long way to go i know some people to play without looking at rank but its a reasonably good signal as to whether youre tuned in into the season or not yeah maybe youre just having a bad read on stuff and if youre ignoring your rank maybe youre having a bad read in a particular important team or something that but i think a lot of people would say just follow the statistics and there in lies the truth but i think if i my rank is going badly then i need to change something im doing even if it means going against principles or something the game is ranked thats what were trying to minimize here yeah fair points man definitely all right mate well lets take a look at how your gw two side played out and what a massive points you managed to pull together which kicked you into this great overall rank lets check take a look at your gw two performance okay mate so congratulations a lovely 91 point hall there and im going to go through p meal here and get your thoughts around how your teams looking not just in gw two but how its shaping up longer and then guys well move on to take a look at what marks plans are in terms of transfers ahead of gw three and well have a look at our stats review that i mentioned last week when we were on with corey as well you now obviously got two data points as well so i want to talk around the defense right now mark you put a lot of money here into defense and into the goalkeeper here it looks handsome returns this week of course strategically is this something that you think youd be recommending to for folks to be doing over the upcoming game weeks as well not sure id recommend doing anything normally i might not invest so much in defense but what i was trying to do this preseason was i had a number of take check boxes i wanted to take and some of those were things having captains in given weeks yeah covering some teams defenses maybe getting specific players and what comes out in the wild is the combination of these i think the alternative i could have had there was to have maybe a better third striker or more money in a midfielder such as smith roow or rogers but i felt in defense i could get maybe two or three good players in at the cost of a better player up front so i wanted to get trent alexander arnold at his price point so good parro i think we all saw what he can do last season and by all accounts he was quite good preseason so i wanted to get him and i wanted to cover the arsenal defense somehow and in goal i just didnt see any keeper that i thought made a compelling argument to be in there and rya tick two boxes he was a decent goalkeeper in my opinion and he covered the arsenal defense yeah love it and 18 points in two games have been pretty fortunate there but he has been pivotal in securing the result for arsenal and both occasions yeah i wouldnt put it down to fortune i think its a great shout man hes looks another great pickup definitely can specific play in vardal obviously were all surprised i guess man city conceded there i guess he can concede to anywhere he secure for you on going in at 6m and the man city defense there are you still thinking thats a investment for yourself and for other fpl managers whove also got him no i wouldnt say hes definitely locked in the long term i think when youre trying to deposit money around your squad he was a safe place to put some money now as it turned out he got a return in the game i didnt expect him to get one and didnt get one in the one i did but i felt putting money into gal there was a level of safeness and guaranteed points returns and i think as we move on and maybe depending on wild when wild cards get played and the arsenal city fix dur in game week five and maybe the desire to upgrade some players in midfield maybe youre thinking about sacka to salah or something pulling money out g gar gal is going to be certainly a consideration for me and so i think hes hes a good place to put money for a little while at the start of the season but he could be downgraded quite easily now that we can get some pictures of who the good 45m defenders are yeah no kidding i think we should move on and have a look at your midfield and just go through them player by player mark so youve got a lot of money put into sacka there another nice return for him hes been incredible hasnt he for over a season now and arsenal looked again impressive there obviously a big chunk of change do you see him being a make weight for salah ongoing or do you think hes going to make a case to stay in your team for the long haul as he did for many teams last season as well i think in principle people would think of him as somebody who can stay there for the long haul just the principle of sacka at 10m that he regularly returns but i think when you look at the fixtures that are coming up for salah if you do want to get him and maybe its a good idea then somethings got to give and essentially its sacka or howand so ill ill take a view on that probably around game week four or five i see yeah fair enough i think if youre not if youre not captaining salah i dont think theres enough between saaka and salah to make salah worth it when you consider that 25 is the difference between trent and a 45m defender obviously so ill reevaluate it on an ongoing basis but i wouldnt theres no week when im upset to have sake in my team and thats even includes week five thats fine yeah i see lets move it on mate nice pick up for em smith row obviously played just over an hour away at old trafford and then picked up this nice rur in game week two as well in a lovely price point as well surely hes going to be safe for this nice run of fixtures to see this is a nobrainer for other folks to be looking to include who didnt pick him up in game week one would you be recommending that as a potential move particularly for in kungu owners potentially who will also cover as part of this question yeah i think ive got two players there who are going to be quite popular tonight probably on sunday night i think i dont think theres any reason not to pick up either of smi roow or rogers and come on to rogers in a minute i think smi r i put him in my team when he moved and i was looking at it and it suddenly occurred to me that i knew nothing about smith row in terms of statistics or how he really profiled because all i remember from him is that he had a lot of substitute appearances for arsenal about two years ago and he scored goals but i didnt and i had him in and i had to go back and i had to look at it critically and see should he be in the team and it turned out he should and for smith roow all that really matters here is if he gets the minutes mhm hes not getting a huge number but hes getting enough and probably will get more and i think marco sila is a really good manager and we can all remember last season they went through a purple patch where maybe they got two games and all they got five goals oh yeah if silva can cs the team into doing this again over the next few two weeks this wont be the last double figure hall that smro gets you heard it here first guys interesting lets look to jason position there and kungu there mark what we thinking here for folks whove whove picked him up in ahead of game week one is it a move on immediately is it any reason why you would stay the course got to be a move right yeah i think yeah okay first of all i put my cards on table i didnt want to get un conquer at the start really but the there wasnt another player i really wanted to get and it felt there was huge potential there we that if he got the minutes he would gna break the game wasnt he was going to break the game yeah and i think we all had cole palmer in our heads as well and we were dreaming a dream maybe and today its one thing that he doesnt start its another thing that they score six goals before he comes on and its even another thing that neto and felix come on before him its not just that he was benched its how far down the order he was so i dont need this in my life so hes gna go okay well i hold that thought lets keep that as a spoiler for our next slide mark when we come on look ahead at your game week three bus team we can talk around transfers there but yeah a movement out seems eminently sensible doesnt it how you feeling about diego j next to mark obviously backto back returns liverpool look excellent dont they really good start to the season for them great pick good pick sound pick how are you feeling about js inclusion in the team and the fpl merits for him great pick good pick sound pick i dont think hes a sound pick i dont think hes a great pick i think hes a good pick okay and hell be a good pick for as long as hes a good pick and hes going to be one of these ones where get off him at the right time thats not now right youre saying stick with for the time being oh yeah i think so theyve won two games two nil hes contributed to the goals in both and he could have got another goal in each game hes i he looks someone whos doing what hes supposed to do in terms of the work rate the liverpool i dont know what we call it now do we call him presses counter presses i dont know but theyre getting after the opposition when the opposition has the ball hes hes making tackles hes an intelligent footballer and hell stay in my team while he stays in the liverpool team really i see and no quals about the game at old trafford in game week three looks a fine fixture for him no clams whatsoever yeah fair enough you mentioned rogers as well mark looked good didnt he in that game against against arsenal lovely price as well one to
