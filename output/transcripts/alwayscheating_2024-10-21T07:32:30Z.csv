all right ready yep all right here we go is it like officially live were officially live okay all right hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast we are doing a live recording today this is the first time you and i have done a weve done in person before but in person with like the new setup on youtube its all new and different were also not usually next to each other like this weve done like london trip side by side youre familiar with the wedding photographer a thing of like youre going to have to get close together like closer than youre comfortable doing just to make the shot you were saying its like the man of constant sorrow brother and speaking of brothers were here with producer dave i am a man there we go nice to see you all right on so were here to talk about our terrible game week eights i think im the only one of the three of us who had moala today so i experienced some joyful emotion on sunday you ended up what eight 10 12 points all told 12 points from mo so then the great regret is its always in hindsight well i should have been more courageous and i should have captain mosala instead of holland so one thing were going to have to talk about on this episode is holland has three blanks in a row where for all of the people who didnt believe the theory of no roger new no de bruyne is going to eat away at hollands points potentially then some people are saying it was me however it is it is saints next week for man city so we theres no way out right for holland owners once you think youre going to get out this southampton pulls you back in its though because i think the question now is ide a vacuum loading up on man city players ahead of the saints match would make a lot of sense but its weirdly i still dont feel confident theyre gonna keep clean sheet even against saints like i feel like somehow theyre gonna have one moment where they just get sloppy and see to a goal and i also dont know what midfielder i would have it may be that you have to wait until the champions league this week to see if to see if like i was saying like if bernard silva doesnt start in the champions league like he might be someone to target if foden doesnt start in the champions league i dont know if that makes me feel better or worse about him starting at the weekend there are a few paths for me to get foden without at without being at the expense of like a premium mid where the whole arsenal bournemouth match is another thing that were going to have to unpack but celba owners now have a free role on a cheaper defender assuming you dont want to stick with arsenal defense and i dont think we can make a real case for that right now but that is a great place to make money to upgrade in my case anthony gordon to somebody like foden right but were still waiting for foden to do something this season you were just reading about the covid conspiracy someone well i dont know its a conspiracy but someone in our app replies said that co f recently had covid and then hes still recovering from it then he may potentially have long co okay so i dont know well so were not were not doctors dave are you a doctor no but i play one on the podcast dr dave okay well that would be a rational explanation were trying to figure out whats happening with foden youre like theres something going on but its been happening for years so has he had long co for years maybe i is he patient zero is what we need to figure out last year he was starting matches this early in the season right like his f returns last season are pretty solid i think it was they have double digit goals and assists last year somewhere in that range at least pfa player of the year its hard to deny no were not here to talk about fodens talent level were here to talk about the mystery of whats going on at man city and like that performance against wolves felt in some way similar to the performance against arsenal where they had to hammer away at a good defensive performance from wolves until they finally got the breakthrough at the very end also it felt a little bit like city playing fulam last two weeks ago where the chances that wolves got were on the counter and were pretty good chances and one of them they finished and the other they simply didnt so it could be looking a lot worse for city right now in the table but liverpool now one point ahead can we start talking about liverpool as like title cont not sure not like its farfetched to imagine that this stacked team would be title contenders but arsenal are just like quickly fading away from this discussion now back to the glory days of city versus liverpool and i think this was the match the arsenal bournemouth match and we lets what lets do a little reset here im freestyling here i enjoy your freestyling but we put together this nice running order and i think that we should try to stick to it so lets lets kick things off so game week eight kicks off with h the spurs spurs west ham match on saturday morning you and i go to smithfield hall meet up with a listener that was nice shout out to fpl rock on twitter darren wonderful guy enjoyed chatting with him hes been and seen football played all over planet earth so its just interesting hearing what hes seen and also his fpl thoughts he run some fpl content out of a podcasting cuba got some spanish content so that was that was very cool so shout out to darren thanks for coming out and the scene is always good at smithfield hall its a west ham supporters bar as well as a man utd bar so we walked into great sorrow and then we emerged victorious with a very man utd fans just cant understand how they got away with it right i think that it was right so the match on saturday morning though was pretty interesting right i think you had a little bit of saka drama which we could talk about more in a second but one option was to move saka to sun which that was the only move that would have worked out this week you did get a fod in assist late right but like thats not four points not that significant but i think what was the bigger news was that you had poro blank brennan johnson blank and blank in a four in a four goal spurs match which i feel like that like it just the whole vibe this week was a real post international break like a little some shaky thought the matches today for example were like surprisingly low quality i thought the spurs or not the chelsea liverpool match i thought was foul heavy and and the man city wolves was just odd like i just felt like it was it was such a especially the second half it was just like a real slog and weve seen a lot of that with man city recently youre looking for much more dynamism from man city they seem to just insist that they can pass through any low block but ultimately i think they just need more players be it greish doku svino who can just beat a man and there that just to create something in the box which makes it even more confusing as to why fodens rollout has been so slow because he is good at operating in those tight spaces and he could certainly help holland had precious few touches one or two moments that could have easily been goalscoring opportunity but youre left feeling like not awesome about holland and this city team despite that victory so lets get into i think like just to go through the weekend which i think might be the a cleaner you want we want to talk what do we just want to talk about sunday and should we just keep it you want you want to work backwards here brandon because we just we just saw these matches so maybe sure maybe working back maybe we just we scrapped the running order already this lovely running order that we put together this morning what are your fpl takeaways from liverpool chelsea i think my takeaways are that chelsea are not a defensive team there was that moment where i think that sanchezs value was inflated by the pens save the 15p pointer that he got y and then they ran into some yellow card suspensions and there was a lot of like ingame rotation with the backline from moresa against chelsea so you were saying you feel like moresa rotates too much too much like what that i feel like mesas hit upon something with chelsea that is certainly working in the attack in the attack aspect but now he just needs to find some cohesion and some continuity and hes not doing that at all and i hes just working with the situation that he got where he had too big a squad and hes just trying to challenge these players to show him where that continuity was would be but i still think its palmer or nobody from the attack nichas jackson did have a pretty good goal though so if you have ridden out a small drought with nico jackson suddenly you should be booed by what happened hes the cl he is the like one of those players that can be hard to evaluate in fantasy because he has like truly terrible body language like when you watch him play he looks like hes absol miserable out there he in that like who we put in there its like mz ozil famously was a bad body language player but who else was like i feel like were missing some other of course brandon always with the what do you think dave am i forgetting a bad body language player here how do you r your body language dave right the great thing about new york is theres so much to see and do im think thinking about that they might be giant song but my body language right now its its hurting but it was good early in the week and then just as the games have gone on like you like you said these sunday games its just dragging us down it has nothing to do with you going to raves at for exactly rolling in exactly but i like to finish that point on chelsea the wingers as good as they are individually theyre still trying to find like it does feel like moresa wants netto to work and and sancho did not have a great game moww is just feast or famine with him fantasy wise so like as much potential as there is with chelsea then you get to liverpool your feelings on liverpool so you only have trent how are you feeling about trent is that a good use of money for you at the moment hes honestly been fine when i think about how my seasons gone so far trents performance is not at the top of the list by any means getting three consecutive blanks from holland has honestly been a bigger problem for me considering this week was a little bit different this week he was heavily captain the last two weeks though he was a little bit of a differential captain it didnt come through at all and so my i have like just larger problems with man city that im trying to figure out i ive dodged at bolet by not having rico lewis like thats one of the like thats one of the few thats worked out reasonably well but i thought salah had a real like a modern salah performance right where he like he struggles to take people on still but now hes now hes heads up looking for the past which has unlocked another aspect of his game and you saw him trying a lot from wide to find his teammates in this match as you have through a lot of this season so as i am ive been like over the last few weeks looking for the jumping off point to move salah to either saka or palmer and after this weekend i think im gonna gota keep going with salah though they play arsenal away in gw n so but what would your palmer lets see palmer plays newcastle next week and newcastle are a total mess right now and anthony gordon has just been hes hes turned from a cheeky differential into just like weirdly killing my weeks from his miss pens to the blanket home against brighton so that is a huge opportunity i think for palmer against newcastle in gw nine i think so is that worth a transfer that would be the question like is it worth so you have two transfers right going into game week n as do i dave do you have did you make a transfer this week or no i have five i think do you i think wow thats amazing so you got to five ive been waiting for someone to get to five transfers i think hold on let me double let me live check here right no i got four sorry is that right one more week to go dave i think i could roll i could roll wow because youre doing youre like what like a 3k right now in the world something like that i was counting no i think i saw that you and dave are roughly exactly in the same position good so hes doing equally terrible thats great seven figures me too sadly so im on 30 points right now thank you mo i did terrible on saturday the only thing i got was a goal from morgan rogers it was blanks from hs the minus three from celba and just bad news all around fulham didnt just didnt coales even though well okay im already moving to saturday but just for my team you are you got like a youre all over the place right now youre ready to talk about fham i think its because the camera is on you and youre youre feeling like a lot of pressure feeling the pressure its like albert brooks in broadcast news but 30 points with just dean henderson to go like 65m gw rank moving me to around 16m overall so ill certainly be finishing on a red error for the week and im just waiting for the moment to kick on man i think a lot of people are feeling that way im on 26 i have e and henderson to go and so im im feeling the same i was feeling okay going into this match and i if id gotten anything from palmer or trent i would feel okay about this week but im already looking at the i think the average score is 31 so im already five under average and so its and a hasnt done anything the entire season right one attack in return in eight weeks so or seven weeks well see what he does tomorrow so but i think its one of those weeks where its its its like a good week to have a bad week as they say theres its not like theres like a massive swing or anything like that so dave what about you like how are you looking on your points so far this weekend 20 something like everyone else 24 25 watkins and rogers well talk about full them but like we said tomorrows game is gna be the clinch the hammer chriswood i got going e its its gonna be a its gonna be an inter its gonna be a moving a move week thats true and i have henderson so maybe henderson ill have a fantastic match i am on 27 because i get i get one point off the bench i get robinson in for greaves i thought robin a yellow but apparently he didnt he put they put a yellow up on the screen at least on the us version of the broadcast and it was an errant a graphic he comes through with a clean one should we take a quick moment we because were recording early on saturday weve got some more uk listeners in the youtube chat our friend fpl yellow army also sebastian front also has five free transfers so thats a were on the lookout for these rare people these unicorns the are there any questions in the chat dave you want we had a we had a an addition to the bad body language of bruno bruno hes a great hes a great bad body language player for that was an interesting moment in that man utd match where there was an a camera angle on bruno where i thought he had joined the turkish hair transplant brigade his hair just looked full this weekend for some reason so but i backed away from that theory and i just feel like i need to say bruno your hair looked you had a great hair day on saturday thats remember when sal used to have the long hair and it was just like not a great i bet it looked cool off the pitch but it was like it didnt did not work on if it rained it was not a great look that hair had goals in it though thats true that hair did have goals in it thats thats a fair point thats a fair point all right well lets so lets return back to saturday as you were saying its i think the fullam villa match its i think my take away morgan rogers scored a goal watkins scored a goal i dont think theres anything super dramatic in that my big fantasy to take away from that match would have been that r jimnez got the full 90 minutes took scored a goal early nice goal as well and played i thought pretty well throughout he only had the one the one big chance but i think if theres been a little bit of hesitation around him just because of his injury history and stuff like that i this feels like the season wherere were all struggling to find that cheap third forward and maybe maybe that doesnt exist maybe its chris wood honestly hes hes the only consistent one i i want to ask brandon about what he feels about jimenez because i saw after the match hes the top value forward on mikel tos table holland hum men a buy brandon why not fulam are an attacking team if nothing else right now and muns just hes lost his spot to ra raul had a fantastic international break with mexico scoring a screamer and fulam do have good fixtures right terrific run everton brenford palace wolves in the next four thats a strong run i although one other takeaway from saturday is two clean sheets in a row for everton they have wred the ship and we i dont know about you guys i just assumed this would happen eventually it was it was like they had last season they had they had a ton of injuries to start the season right and so we and even now they brw is still not back although he should be soon thats one of the unfortunate things is that probably michael keane who had a great match today or le from f perspective hes at 41m but i think you have to avoid kean unfortunately because i do think that he had been dropped for br branway last year and so i think hes a doubt but you did have the u michael kane though remains a great actor micha michel michael kane fantastic and when he scores points his voice the trip the trip that was good we needed that dave but i but speaking of everton i think that for anyone whos looking like you and i like one of the things that screwed us one of the reasons that you and i and many others are on less than 30 is he has a cba right and not just getting negative3 from him but the fact that anyone who had rya got hurt by that limited all of arsenals attacking sort potential in that match sure it hurt me having hovers and the damage was already done to saka owners so saka being a miss there was just it was an interesting wave waveform of content leading up to the gw talking about saka andy martin i think probably had the cleverest thing where he drove down to arsenals hotel in bournemouth and took a photo of himself and where they had saw the team getting off the bus to do a height comparison hes based hes based in south africa too so thats thats incredible commitment so i hope you have diamond status andy to afford that flight because to do that last minute is crazy theres a lot of stur and drang about who knew what do we know anything josh about team sheets what do you mean do we you getting inside leaks right so okay i okay i wouldnt know the first thing of how to get them to be so you so you and i thought about this and so just for anyone who isnt on twitter and congratulations if you arent thats thats fantastic good exactly and twitter is a is a dying social media network that has now been like its primarily fpl as far as i can tell its like those are the people who are like hanging on and theyre just everyone is absolutely furious with each other and this is like this been going on for like a year and a half i bowed out like unfortun i now turned twitter into like a place where i just like share like podcast information fpl twitter is like going to a sunday family dinner with your like extended relatives often it is cordial but you all know that you all secretly hate other or its its like a its like a family trip that go thats one day too long and and i just think u okay the coup i have a couple of thoughts about this and so the issue was that there was a lot of information about saka or a lack of information about saka and most of the people who are making fpl i dont like the phrase content creators i dont know why but like a lot of people who make fpl youtube videos and podcast whatever we advocating to keep saka and thats where we i just my rationale was that he always starts he always starts artetta is not one of these managers like if artetta says that hes close to starting my expectation is that he probably will start its not like i dont think its like whereas other managers like eddie how for example right you genuinely have no idea like if how says that eso is we plan to have him start tomorrow that means its like 5050 right like you genuinely cant believe what he says but i think and so there was a lot of debate about this it turned out like all of these people dropped saka and you and i cool guys that we are didnt even have saka so we were able to avoid that we had no one to drop we had no one to drop so and dave you had you had saka yourself right and so you kept him youre also in the club i was in i was in the you were all family in the club no that was my thought too its like worst case scenario hes not in squad youll get sing off the bench at samano for sub so its that was a pretty easy solution but like we were talking about before i think it was a sound theory because the pictures coming up are turning for saka they with no odard hes looking all off so but i the also the al alternatives werent super clean like its a double transfer to palmer or its foden who we all we already talked about is a risk and i love foden but so son was a risk too a little bit consistent as well hes got a son sun has not been a like a super reliable fantasy asset this season sun was clearly past fit for the weekend but i agree with you both like it was spurs were in at least some goal scoring form without him you never know how slowly andrew is going to want to bring him back there so there was some risk there too but that turned out to be the best mo i think in some ways that were a little bit on the outside of this of this world because a lot of the content that we do were not were not doing a lot of deadline streams right were not like talking to people 10 minutes before partially because we dont were were still asleep when the deadline hits right its like the deadline is 600 am east coast time it is not i am not up at in most cases every on then if its like if its crucial ill ill do it but in general im not waking up at 515 to check things im just im going with it and so i think so we dont necessarily get like hit by this stuff as much but i think this theres an idea out there that and like this just speaks i think a little bit and i like forgive me if im going off fpl here a little bit but like just the relationship that people have with people who create content a little bit and this idea that like hey you were saying to me yesterday hey like no ones making like a ton of money on this theres this belief that theres this iory tower in which somebody who makes just go to i implore you to go to our youtube channel and look at the quality of this were what are you taking the camera the face okay well okay back up i know youre talking about us here by the way im in joshs house right now and i dont know the money seems to be rolling in here so you are in a parlor so but none nonetheless the point is that there is this like class structure and content creators are a like reaping this incredible revenue from it while not doing any work like the people who do make money like from it like work their tails off and we so whatever that would be the point can i ask you a question though about that so even putting the money aside or including the money even whats the incentive to lie right does that mean youre g to watch more contribute to someone who lies to you whats the whats the game theory of this im not understanding theres some edge in duding three or 400 people or whatever right about what youre doing its like theres theres 12m people or whatever 11m people playing fantasy like the amount of people that you would gain an edge on is so small right and well youre not making money by playing fpl because that be against the rules right well theres that too so i dont understand like what even is the argument of why but i think thats the sub i think thats the subex the subtext of people getting mad about this stuff is that that they are doing it to get an edge over the opposition right i think that to me is what people are mad about this idea that theres like that they have secret knowledge theyre not sharing in order to like get more rank and i think youre rightly making the case and again we dont need to like belabor this because even so like andy said he might change it two days before i watched a video so i dont see where people get this and just this idea that like that people have i dont think theres that much see im in plenty of like dm threads with like these exact people and a lot of them like i believe me like a lot of them are talking minutes before the deadline trying to like cas me about asking everybody else if they know anything right its not like its not like theres like the secret feed and we know the cheaters are pro leaks you guys will share any leaks that no ones ever done it though its a the problem is our listener base pro right there proof were breaking conspiracies here live i think its its ultimately to our benefit that our listener base is not a twitter base and so its so funny like i think of my friends no and louise who are producers of the pod and every now and then ill talk to them and theyre just they do not pay attention to any of this stuff and they think like its insane that anybody does and im like thats probably like even though they manage a fantasy team the joy they derive is is watching the matches of the weekend and exactly and they have a mini league of their own and i we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and that a lot of the anger that people have about fantasy stems from caring about overall rank right and i think that this is just something i think like maybe this like has to be like a theme for us this year which is like invest in your mini leagues invest in headtohead leagues invest in stuff that you can do with smaller groups of people where you have a better chance of winning because if your goal is to finish in the top 10000 out of 11m people your odds are about as good as its like its not like winning the lottery but its about like not as good as arsenal winning the league you should say exactly youre talking about investing time id say theyre lower than that talking about time investment right time in all of it so its just like its its just not i just think like theres i think our goals should be focused on and like find like find like again like yes watch the matches enjoy them find moments of joy in that of course but i think just like looking purely from a fantasy point of you if youre if youre only thinking about overall rank its probably a quick way to just spend a lot of week and i feel guilty of this too spent a lot of time getting frustrated right like if i asked you like right now i am feeling frustrated with my season right im like in the millions like davis and i youre not that far into the hundreds thousands i at 16m are exactly so like were all like a rough season and but if i look at like and i have to force myself to do this right but if i looked at our mini leagues even like the ones that are like more competitive where i would like to win i maybe 30 points back 35 like its nothing right theres 30 weeks to go in the season like its so long plus the mystery chip thats gonna change everything exactly maybe the mystery chip will just be like you click the button and you get the leaks you get the leaks or its like or its like a lottery and its like you just hit a button you get like someone gets an extra 100 point someone get an extra 200 like who knows whats gna happen the mystery chip yes well so thats thats whats going on thats an update on whats going on in the fpl twitter space speaking of conspiracies though do we need to go back to arsenal and talk about further red card drama for them what did you make of the civa red card and like dean rice saying to the officials after the match it happens to us every week well i thats just like thats a self every manager is full of selfpity and and has there a lot of like you mean like listen like its it i to me its and everyones everyone who is like provar is gonna hate this but to me its like its another v problem which is that it force like theres no once you look at v theres no way not to call that a red card right because it is by every technical rule like an off like its its hes the last man hes the last defender and so you have to do but the referee on the pitch called it a yellow and that from a from like an enjoyment standpoint and ultimately from a fantasy standpoint too depending on how many arsenal assets you had its like its the its it like it made it made for a worse match right and so its like that is whats frustrating to me and i just think that vr i dont know the exact same play happened today against with liverpool chelsea where tosen took joe to down within the first 10 minutes of the match thankfully they didnt carbon cop and oliver in the var boo decided to stick with the yellow card instantly too which i think was smart it was like four i dont think you arrive was like 4 seconds in he was like nope this were just not gonna call this right so you do feel for arsenal getting hit with all these like minor infractions that lead to red cards but i fluky it is fluky and i have this theory that i think artetta and anyone whos watched the all or nothing amazon documentary about ettas season with that season with arsenal where artetta is just a guy who enjoys putting out these like big brain nba theories about how to play football and how to be tactical and i think his weirdness is now in the heads of all of these arsenal players so theyre like overthinking all of these instances on the pitch and trying to gain an edge like artetta tries to gain an edge in the press conference room of like lying about players injury status and then hes got his players on the pitch doing weird similar types of things but with trying to like walk that red card line or delaying the game and all that stuff i think its i just think its fluky honestly and i think if you look at all the all the situations its you had a time wasting right thats thats isnt that what got trer knocked out of the match in the man city right its like time wasting and you had the dean rice i dont think should have been a red card it was a second yellow and a red but like i thought that one was like another was that was that is that time wasting too so same exact same thing that trer did so so two time wastings and then and then a technically accurate red card so i think that is all just like fluky stuff thatll that will get wiped away but i am curious about the clean sheet part of it and the and i think there is like a like an actual fpl angle to this and whether we think my feeling is this and you guys tell me if you disagree you had a lot of a lot of international tournaments this summer right and so a lot of players came back late a lot of top players especially defenders center like a bunch of center backs top clubs were playing not ben white as we all know but many others of course now hes a right back mostly but i think that you so they didnt necessarily have enough time to practice together and i think that i think there so a little bit of that a little bit of theres so much money in the premier league now that even bournemouth level clubs can get like aelon type players right like you just like you can like bring in like talented brazilians to be your forward even if youre like the 15th best team in the premier league imagine shakiri at stoke city its its that and so i think thats part of it too its just like its i dont think you get like in la liga or the bundesliga like this level of talent like at the in the bottom third of the of the league and so i think that affects clean sheets maybe like more increasingly but i but i do think ultimately long term that we will get there again and maybe this is just something that we just need to like think about going forward which is just dont focus dont invest too much money in your defense the first half of the season and the second half of the season is when you can start to turn the dial a little bit because i feel like we see this every single year with man city which is that they have this run where they can see a bunch of goals and then the final 10 weeks of the season no one can score on them right it is like they one nil their way to a title and i just dont i just think were gonna see that again this year what do you guys think dave man city that there theyre a punchline defensively at least in fantasy terms how close are you as of today in considering a city defender for the run you brought this up and i just mely said like you like i just ive gone through the ederson ringer weve all had like josh you said rico lewis he is hes probably a buy still because hes starting every match so he and he does get forward a little bit too will be the bandwagon during this transfer window because the run continues for city is he scored his second goal of the season and he finished last season so strong that people will remember that so i think cba to guardal is probably the algorithmic preference for going into gw nine thats interesting that makes a lot of sense im surprised i havent thought about that more seriously thats a pretty logical move i know but like you just said that long point you made i think was good though its like why would we have that undermine the point i just it makes a lot of sense can i spend more money on my defense ignore everything i just said and plus trent like if we have him and gabriel sure thats why ric loose might feel more tempting because you can use that money so what is how do you measure the upside of guardal it is its the same with trent where youre just talking about the high ceilings but it has been so variable the returns on defenders that i im sure an equally compelling case could be made to just getting all 45s well lets well theres not that many good can you bring up the fpl hub heat map for guardal exactly i let me see if i can pull that up in real time without things getting too chaotic here but i am i am okay so lets lets say that like we like that we believe what ive just said which is that you want to maybe scale back a little bit on your defense and i feel this way a little bit about trent where i do wonder if that money could be spent invested and a and like a better third forward perhaps i have jamie vardy at the moment like that cant last im gonna keep im gonna keep jamie vardy ponzi scheme is i know exactly i did finally get a goal this week thankfully b pump and dump over here exactly that goal exactly if we all get b its better for josh if this if this were draft league then id be be even better id be trying to you switch him off but so hes got to go eventually and maybe theres like a i dont know like maybe i can find someone else it could just be i go back to chris wood but lets say that i want to start taking some money on my defense and put it in my midfield and forward lines and i think and maybe the other the other way would be that weve talked before about how you just want to try to have three out of four of these like expensive premium assets and that just may be the thing that you need to do and that youre going to always get something and i think we saw that this week right like in play but and when i say four im thinking saka holland palmer and salah right those are like the big four the big four fantasy assets this season i think and it seems like every single week youre gonna get like one of those will carry you if you have them now you could have had holland holland saka and palmer and palmer this week and that would have been three blanks but i think without saka playing i think if saka had played thats a totally different story im going to ask you a hypothetic here josh dave i want to hear your opinion too imagine holland blanks against southampton at home at the edie hot you laugh and you think like how improbable it is right but itll be four blanks in a row and in those blanks you have some weak opposition you look at the injuries surrounding the club how close would you be to dropping holland if he were to blank against southampton is that a conversation you to even entertain it wouldnt be at the top of my priority list still im going to make a decision off one week but also we had a question on the youtube of are you is this hurting the coland triple captain shout against how i think i think it is talking about dumping him people are talking about triple captaining him like hurts it i dont know i dont know how you can triple captain him at the moment like i think hell score this next weekend but if there was a say like foden and im sorry well say foden and de bruyne returns from his injury midweek in the champions league and there was that dramatic a shift and how you expected man city to line up against southampton potentially but yes as it is given the state of play i just cannot of fathom triple captaining holland right now what do you think dave i dont know maybe dibling in if they could do give it to dibling for the end of the season im thinking the other side the galaxy brand they keep making goals thats true dibling 45 right im just im a like you josh i enjoy by the way on the on the patreon pods you go through some of the odds of the anytime goal scorers i think right im ill be honest im a slave to those odds because like those are efficient markets usually and just hollands just always very good odds to do something so i dont see myself dropping them it is like they have to it feels like pep will figure this out its a little bit like like were talking about d and everton earlier its like this idea that things arent working and theyre not feeding the ball to holland is like a problem that cant be fixed is i think wrong right like in gandan and berard silva and phil foden whenever he gets over his long covid in the years to come i dont know i who know im not im not planting that in the world that was just what somebody said in one of our replies i think that you have like eventually theyre going to figure maybe jack relish needs to get back in there like they need like somebody whos like a better creator right im not sure doku is as good of a is greish on the left and so i think that theyre and theyre missing rodry but i just i do think that pep is the premier leagues best manager and i think that hell eventually and eventually like as in like 20 weeks i think like by this weekend possibly hes going to figure it out but to go back to my question about defense lets say we wanted to take the money out looking at these fixtures like the next seven this i almost never looked seven fixtures ahead by the way i think five or six is as far as i ever want to look this because too many things change to people get injured but are there a couple of teams that you would recommend somebody targeted if they were looking to drop celba or if they were looking to clear up money to bring in lets say saka gets a clean bill of health and its a terrible week to bring in saka but like lets say lets say you want to bring in palmer and you want to keep saka while youre doing it who would be some sheep defenders that you might look at i like still like naam forest great stats i am haunted by that assist that ana had against liverpool to hudson ooi earlier this season i think and they have at least two good fixtures coming up with theyre haunted like because you wanted to im haunted just in like i think about it all the time im not haunted like it affected my life its like its like a 19th century like english novel spooky season i am doing a lot of opium though to go with the maybe that something to do with how i seea everywhere but i do but they have lester away and then wam at home and west ham just the implosion continues and even newcastle at home you have to like for forest so i think you mentioned everton before and everton have this newfound defensive form im curious about these fixtures though for everton fulham even though theyre hosting fulham are an attacking team very capable of scoring we talked about the run that raul is on and then probably the two best defensive fixtures for everton are away from home with southampton and west ham and then they finish off this mini run of theirs with brenford at hosting at goodison park who is also a pretty adept fork i wonder if thats a little stand that they have outside the stadium how could it not be how could the best the best sausages this side of the the ts like this which i know it is does not run as far north as that but so if im comparing everton and forest thats my little like te aet there im im going forest i was making a tiny shout for udogie as a cheaper route into the spurs defense the problem right now is youre not getting clean sheets anywhere right and so you ideally this one of the reasons im not like dying to get rid of trent because im like well at least he has different like multiple routes to points right like sometimes ill look into a clean sheet and sometimes ill ill get an attack in return but aogi has been like a reasonably attacking asset for for spurs and so he might be somebody poro is still the top poro has set pieces over udi hes more consistent defensively he does shoot more he had a great opportunity off of corner kick this on saturday and some would argue that vanen is roughly the same price says udi and maybe hes a little bit more con consistent i dont know udis had a very strange season hes had moments where hes been very defensively inept but thats just like a read outside of the fantasy game its just all about returns and i do see what youre seeing josh where he is getting into the box a bit more when theyre pushing down that left hand side of the pitch its just that hes 49m right so hes hes pretty cheap like you could you could move and they have like a pretty decent run of fixtures palace villa villas a tough fixture but then if switch and fulam at home two the three after that so i dont what do you think dave about the spurs defense in general its been a source of some frustration the last few weeks i think i think parros the obvious move if youre gonna do a civa replacement so but its not im not super excited and i to consult the heat maps on new doggy i dont have a heat map here but heat map over here por 55m is poro so hes point6 more than than ad dogy but he does have its five blanks in six for poro as well which is a lot for like a to me its like if im if im gna a defender that costs more than five million i want some i i want to be averaging some return whether its clean sh attack return like every other match right because its quite a lot of money when you can fluke your way into clean sheets of any old 45m well thats what im saying is it even worth at that point because then just go the clean sheets with like forest or brighton or anyone di and a dogies just got the one assist so far in the season youre not gonna get a return from a defender every other game it seems like at the moment so exactly maybe trent gets you the closest yellow army makes a good point on the chat it was anthony elena who got that assist well so im still haunted by ana im trying to figure out why spectre cant you cant make out the shapes its its like a smoke smokey vision it could be grandma it could be grandma im not sure grandma thats i think thats the title for todays podcast it could be grandma and other thoughts on game week nine all right well lets anything else that you want to discuss we can we can move on and talk about game week n in a second here but any other final thoughts on on the matches that we saw over the weekend i think we probably covered everything the one newcastle that is the one where i just its surprising to me theyve had a number of good fixtures and just feels like the vibes are off mag we need a vibe shift with newcastle sometime soon it is all it all stems we thought that all of newcastles good fortune and good form stemmed from jool linton it turned out it was kieran trippier the whole time and as he has faded from the team so has the form so all right i think its over for lets lets move on lets talk about game mc99 just quickly before we do i want to give a quick shout out to everyone who sports the podcast on patreon you can go to patreon including our friend over here hes not just our friend hes our patreon supporter maybe one day you can become a patreon supporter and be right in this room

the discord the discord is im honestly and i know i always say this and its it but it like the way it continues to evolve and expand its there are people on there who its its a its it it feels like its genuinely replaced social media for a lot of people and i think in a way thats positive and theres lots of little sub i think because you and i are mods on there we like we see every little subgroup right and theres little theres little we see everything but theres these little south american i see what you and the norwegian channel are up to okay dont think that were not watching meetups and theres like theres theres a betting channel and theres fashion and like music and nfl lot of nfl so youre the mod of nfl exactly theres nfl fantasy leagues theres all kinds of stuff on there and so its a fun commun so if you feel like if this saka situation and youre just like my god im just so sick of this stuff and you want to be somewhere where like things are just a little calmer and people arent screaming each other all the time you can go to patreoncom support the podcast and even at the lowest pledge level you get access to the discord and so thats just a nice way to maybe get some access to some new fantasy content and then u were also were gonna start a contest sometime soon i think we talking about maybe doing it before the second half this time around just because i know some people are getting a little frustrated with their overall ranks and it might be a chance to get to juice things up maybe well do it like after the next juice we have thankfully you i know you guys are sick of the premier league already we got another national break coming up in a couple of weeks and so it might be a time to to kick off one weekend of premier league was plenty get me out of here i know exactly already gearing up for the next ib so we should do like an off the side fpl challenge league its like you guys like i dont even know what fpl challenge is and you were explaining to me i was like sounds fun and if its a daily fantasy theres always you dont have to worry about your current team so maybe can do like a second half like league with that its a little its a little bit like d and d where its like you need someone to be like the like i just mean like you need someone to like be the like what are they dungeon master dungeon master you just need someone to be that was the word i thought it was then i was like i doubted myself at the last second but you need somebody to safe politically to say dungeon master exactly im not gonna get cancel for saying dungeon master no but its its a its like you need someone to whos like enthusiastic who leads the chart right and this goes back to the mini thing we talking about before too this is like patreon stuff aside but if you if youre not if the person who leads your mini league isnt like actively managing it or like engaging it maybe you need to be that person its like its like be the be the change exactly thank you obama thanks obama all right well lets move on then i want to look ahead to gw nine i think the captaincy we have a couple of questions too but just to kick things off captaincy i think is relatively straightforward this week right i think its going to be i very hard for me to vision not going with early holland even with those blanks but if holland were to get injured or if there was some risk of him starting right theres some leak that comes out that hes not expected to start this match like that then i think you could you could consider and bomo right i think hosting nip switch could be one ando blanked this week for the first time in quite a while and just imagine having an asset where its surprising when they blank and his name is not earling holland right it was it was surprising to see on bomo blank this week and he has a plum home fixture apologies to our buddy james holland but ipswitch just have not got going this season at all and for all the talk about how well managed they are and how theyre theyre like canny enough to play in the premier league they are a team to target at this point as far as im concerned at as far as everyones concerned im going out on a limb here i understand but okay so like thats so captain c fairly simple vice captain i think i probably will end up putting on emb maybe ill put on co palmer that would be the other logical vc pick herz against everton well thats an interesting question because i do think that everton is a team where you could target their defensive assets too and i wonder if that could be to me guess like maybe the most likely scenario was like 11 for that match but i one nil everton win wouldnt be like a shocking result there so what about in terms of you guys your teams this week maybe well start with dave what are you you have five you have four transfers im rolling no matter what to get the five just for the bit just for the banter for the just to see that number in the in the bus team next week are you are you are you being serious like guess think i have a cra problem because of a s a half problem so wed share your team but we just because weve got this like hacked setup for the todays stream im not gonna do no i wild card a few weeks ago so i had to fairly template wild card team but no diaz which has been a good move but then of the sano smith row eighth attacker like trick rotation thing so i dont know i you could so theres might be some opportunities to fiddle around with stuff but again i dont know who is a screaming b this week as weve talked about so i think if you i think what lets say like you had the luxury of not needed to make any big changes this week i think watkins would be someone you could target well you already have them but i just in general sing to just general sorry a good speaking of a good question in the chat around spurs of there scoring goals but and brandon this is your pet topic of do you want someone a team to target thats scoring a lot of goals but its spread out or the concentrated tip of the spear of low scoring i know you feel strongly about this but it is frustrating to have senen and then four goal game and nothing so thats super frustrating but it seems fluky though too right exactly so i dont know if can we see it josh can we see it first hes hes done a two ex i know youre trying to rope me into simmons talk here but its i hes hes had returns in the two previous weeks right sank so i we have been seeing him round into fantasy shape he hasnt i dont think hes had a big match right i dont think weve seen him like even necessarily get like multiple attack and returns in a match so far i think to watch him play he is its so much hold up play from him and i think like some spurs fans would suggest that an will change those tactics depending on the opponent and i think west ham would be given their vulnerability on crosses and set pieces still it didnt feel like salanki was a huge part of that plan for him to be getting the final ball still he was playing very well as a hold up player but its just im not seeing the huge fantasy ceiling for i think and i think and i just pulled up his stats he had attacks in three matches in a row before this one takes long but he not you want the double digits so maybe sun is a possible outside play and theyre a little tricky too because you can see three matches in a row three attacking returns you before this blank and yet no bonus in any of those matches right and so that does get to the other problem of the old school back when man city were scoring four or five goals a match you needed to have kd b or aguero and if you had a like it was always tempting to get a bernardo silva type player right because theyd always be the one of the cheapest options in their d silva back when he was there but but often they would get one attack in return and no bonus right and so its like youre like ah is this worth 75m or whatever and so maybe we are a little bit there with salanki i think the problem is i dont know like what about brenan johnson dave youre a sore supporter like hes been hes been great hes on fire that could be a p but again its like its the price thing youre just like well hes not i dont mean to b down but like whos exciting to bring in its like hes so cheap hes almost not exciting youre like i have 5m in the bank thats not fun just psychologically the moves i know i think thats one of the reason i didnt bring him in this week either i just couldnt get excited enough about it if br johnson was 10 points too wed all have them its so true isnt that funny the way that works sometimes i know its so true and i dont know palmer the still the fixtures are not great i think what ill ill give a shout out to the content creators of so hey palmers banging them in but the pictures are gna turn so is he a buy and he hasnt been tough because pictures create points so and hes still okay took four shots today he had a big chance in the first half i think or biggish chance it was a big chance for him i dont maybe for a lesser player thats a low percentage chance but he did a i this was always going to be a tough match for him and i think newcastle at home id be very surprised if he didnt get some attack in return in that one but you guys we gloss over watkins for a second i do think that theres there is some potential there the question is like lets say you were scared off of foden but maybe but maybe you do want to drop cipa this week ahead of the run could you maybe go i dont know how much it depends how much money you have in the bank already but a move that was like watkins to what lewis for example excuse me let start where we going sba cba to lewis thats a big s but lewis would free up like 15m roughly i think some somewhere in that maybe a little less than that maybe like 12m now and maybe then you could go chris wood or somebody you whatever whoever your third forward is you could upgrade to watkins and i that wouldnt be terrible but then after this week watkins has spurs away liverpool away chelsea away three in the next four bor so hes almost like a get off i was looking at the drop so i dont know hes like a hold for this week but after that i dont know villa have a home fixture midweek on tuesday against bolognia for the champions league certainly that it good us some pork as well or get us in pork its theres some distance pork and goodis and pork but the pork pies are stronger through that entire corridor the bolog try the fried bolognia sandwich certainly im holding my transfers until we see those champions league what are what are the fixtures this week in the champions league so youve got villa hosting bologna you always get so emotion it looks like thats the only premier league club thats thats playing on tuesday then on wednesday youve got man city hosting sparta praha liverpool away arby leig which may be the trickiest of them lets see im just hunting around for the arsenal champions league fixture as if following champions league in america wasnt hard enough cu well working this new structure is diabolical these pictures are crazy i can follow its like its its a mix of one of the most difficult fixers you can imagine or the easiest fixer you played all season like are we sure its thats arsal arsenal hosts shakar donet on tuesday so villa and arsenal both home on tuesday and then city at okay liverpool on wednesday so should have europa league as well right on thursday you so lets see im im man united are away at fer aach on thursday hunting around here for lets see blah right there blah go up a little bit go up a little bit okay thank you for finding that and reading that chelsea are away in gree at pananos as discussed with cole palmer hes not even on their roster for hes still not on that okay no i dont think they submit a new roster until they get out of the group stage okay of the competition so hes free and easy hes its interesting you bring up like palmer is such a difficult player to not own right now because he is that guy but they have bad fixtures when is the right moment to get him i do feel like the newcastle fixture is good enough to just go for palmer and i am think im considering ways to downgrade celba or another player in my 11 to upgrade anthony gordon to palmer that would probably require three transfers so would not take a minus four just to get polymer in the midst of this run but i do feel like that is a great fixture you down are you could downgrade salo because as we saw today his returns are totally fluky and you got lucky so thats true i got lucky playing the variance with most the variance game with him as he moves ninth place in alltime premier league goal scorer why would you guys do if you had what would you guys do if you had diaz get rid of him no its i think so too the boil and unfortunately because theres another international break coming up in november it does seem like you and i brandon were talking about this morning arot does seem like a manager whos going to use the whole squad i salah is like one of those players hes like the so hes like the hes a hes a mov he also came back early from the international break which made it even easier but i think it as we have we are now seeing it for real right which is there are four players for five slots in front well see about jod he went off injured that but either way and cody thought was pretty geeko i thought was irrelevant he was very quiet darwin came on and put himself about he was like mr dark arts against chelsea this weekend but i thought that liverpool benefited from that he was distracted some of the chelsea defenders so as far as slot saw it i think he would be pleased with darwins performance sol could work his way behind him it seemed like when he was pushing up front was good and what about you brandon in terms of your transfers so i think if i look at my squad the problem players are celba with the red card and i feel like its im good going without arsenal defense right now i thought it feels like a coupon that the league gave us i was telling you this josh where when that wild card turn happened around gw six that was when rya and gabrielle was scoring his set piece goals looked unstoppable rya was getting a lots of fpl returns as well and then people moved off of cba to get those guys and that there is the double arsenal defense because we didnt wild card at that time we still had cba so now were in a position to just like for free just get off of the arsenal defense train while they go through this rough b batch of fixtures but if you have rya and gabrielle im not sure you can find a good enough reason to get rid of them so not certainly not right and the thing is once they get past this trio of rough fixtures its its its a fantastic run for them right so you just have to weather the storm even if it will storm we dont know arsenal are good enough to certainly clean sheet in any fixture so its cba and gordon and i need to just look at more options in terms of downgrading celba does that open up something more interesting for gordon to become right because if you lets say lets say you did like the one of the cheapest options which was you took you turn cbos around six million into maybe a little more or less into like mikeno one 43 that would open up fre that would free up 17m for you its still not enough for me to turn anthony gordon into palmer sure its its enough for me to turn hts into ali watkins so and hts is the tertiary player on the bubble for me where even though hes had a good run hes been great for arsenal this season i think given the shape the arsenal team is in theyre not probably not going to be scoring three or four goals anytime soon although as dave said the run for watkins gets worse after game week nine probably not its it feels like long term probably not like thats a transfer that its hard to like net out super ahead on that if howards plays 90 in midweek and the team looks a little ragged harts might move closer to my maybe he gets turned into watkins plan but w watkins has the same midweek week issue so ive got a lot of balls in the air here the other ele in the room for me is wild card but that to me wild card is all about how im going to do premium asset structure and i think still optimally assuming everyones healthy it feels like holland plus saka plus palmer and i need i feel like i want a wild card in order to get that and there are too many things in motion right now its not doesnt feel like a good week to make that put a steak in the ground i think i think in two weeks time when arsenals fixer run gets good that is a great time for you to wild card because you could go you could go to three options right and youd be itd be a good time to reset a little bit as far as my team just because ive got it pulled up here i will ill pick my team for next week 27 points thats brutal i know im telling you bud its its been a rough run okay you just start putting out some fake info to help your i know exactly so this is my squad right now for for gw nine it looks okay its its its like its an acceptable squad like if i had to do nothing i would be okay with that like if i were dave i would probably just save my transfer and have three i think there might be an opportunity here because i do have two transfers to change things around a little bit i think it feels like its last chance city for e i would like to see him do something in on in mondays match to feel confident in holding on to him i think who do palace host spurs its honestly not a bad fixture for him but so like that doesnt feel like the most urgent issue it would be great to get another man city asset and so i could look at as something as simple as cba vardal would be would be an option in that case it probably bench robinson i dont know its like and maybe hold one of my other transfers that might be that might be a possible move vardy i would like to drop eventually but i dont necessarily need to do that away to arsenal like not great but probably fine like its not something that im like again no ones keeping clean sheets so so moving like wasting a lot of money on defenders feels which i know undermines my gardial point but because its southampton theyve been so bad this season you could make an argument for that like theres the upside is there for gardial theres a chance of like a 15o level return and thats something worth shooting for so i dont know you guys looking at my squad do anything else stand out to you as like an urgent not having saka remains a big problem but i think i can fix that in a couple weeks i dont think thats a problem right now not for the liver not for the next couple weeks i dont want necessarily want them right now so i think to your point yet your weakest links are pretty like luxury moves so its your its your bench that might be the weakest link with g the greaves injury and the celba suspension you have no defenders to rotate or cover so but you wouldnt look to upgrade greaves to serious hamstring injury out for a month my goodness that could be mind games thats thats true who knows usually those things are like based on like lit like a literal comment from a manager its like a few weeks few weeks time well see them i do subscribe brandon though to the theory of if you lose a defender youre losing a maximum of two points none of them score anyways so and maybe thats the secret benefit so the f up to five free transfers you talk about that like a mini wild card well its an interesting strategy for fixing your bench because if you want need to fix your bench and you have one or two free transfers youre limited in what you can do and you often make compromises in terms of how creative you can be if you had three or four transfers you fix your bench and do something interesting with one or two starting players so it i think you can weather a benching storm for i look at my like if i look at my squad right now and you look at my 11 and i just were to swap out robinson for vardal then id have a squad that i liked for gw and i know like for podcast listeners they are not looking at my squad right now but its a pretty its its ive got watkins holland bardy up front momo rogers palmer e again all fine right and then as a i dont know like arguable but like spurs are just like conceding goals for fun so like it feels like thats a match where he could he could do something its almost baked into their approach right but im not going to waste a transfer on a keeper and and then con is fine even robinson would be okay i just dont expect f to keep a clean sheet in that match although they did a way to forest in a similar match a few weeks ago so not the most consistent so exactly so thats thats where i am lets lets wrap things up here with just a couple of questions shane asked about thoughts on defender strategy i think we covered that already so sam c asked about says solid with more points than holland he says by the time this match finishes and almost three million cheaper is crazy if you think about its all its solid as expensive as he is its three million cheaper than holland can we swerve holland and have some extra cash to spread around of course i blame the content creator calver not telling me sa is good that is a joke but okay so lets say after southampton regardless of what holland does is it is it time to consider moving him on or are we just rearranging deck chairs trying find the right premium is good i dont know what to say like we saw it today were just like he go by watching that match like hes gonna get pens sure and assists and i dont youll take along but i dont know like he had no clearcut im talking over you dave here but ive got a interesting point to make i was looking at you sol had no clearcut goal scoring opportunities and open play it was the pen and then he was creating chances for his teammates i still think hes hes below palmer saka and holland on the premium asset list all right i think so i think its pretty its pretty tight between all four of them again if i the other strategy that i could do this week and ill maybe give a little more thought would be to just keep saving transfers and stick to my guns and ultimately downgrade celba and trent and try to turn e into saka which would give me saka palmer holland and allow me to stick to my gun idea that you just want three out of four of these premium assets so that would be one option too id have to like do a little investigating how honestly i could get rico lewis and that might be enough if i turned celba into lewis trent into like a 45 that probably would be enough for me to turn a into saka so thats another possibility too all right so final questions from al aloha lounge she says has foden done enough to prove to pep to prove to pep that he needs to start no tell no historically or like its like who knows like how do you prove youre over long co dave youve had long covered for four years now you tell me im sorry i shouldnt make we havent seen how peps shirts look after foden has ironed them i assume this is how you prove your value to guardal its the little things like picking up the dry cleaning and like washing the dishes and that thing how good is the tea that foden is brewing that in the staff cafeteria i slept through the game so you guys tell me how he looked but foden they did start for one well thats not a good sign so hes not and he and he didnt influence the game at all after coming on apart from taking a well taken corner to deliver the jon stones goal so but that goes also back to the holland question of okay then what city asset are we just not having city players like it just seems crazy and then what the alternative like premium assets and theres not like super ones this week so thats why i just i just feel like keeping holland is just sensical but im open to it we werent we podcasting like months ago about like you cant have everybody theyre all everyones so good and now were going through this like e where its like no ones quite there happens with the fixtures thats it just so happens were in a transition week with fixtures too so im gna be in 28 points brandon once i once i get that robinson point subbed in there you things are looking up for old josh landon all of a sudden vy somehow nicked a bonus point while we were talking today he has gained a bonus point how why is this happening this year all of a sudden these bonus points josh is a good actor i see the dms open with fpl towers negotiating the exra bonus point first party pump and d scham i know with this yellow cards get punished too much in this game in my opinion theres too many punishment you want talk about bps scoring system thats everyones favorite topic right all right so i think end the stream all right so i think that i had one final question for you guys which was we talked a little bit about lewis we talked a little bit about vardal a little bit about foden are there any other because the southender match is a fantastic match are there any other possible fantasy assets on man city i know they the champions league as a factor and then but lets say that we get a predictable champions league 11 is there is there anybody i think youve named plenty thats all we need okay like theres like because like there could be defenders or is there any edge in any or any or even other defenders like im just curious is there any edge to be g picking someone off the table vodin is the choice and hes not a choice youll talk yourself into getting bernardo silva or doku and these are these are paths to pain youre right all right so there we are and i think thats it i think we can wrap this up guys yes and thanks everyone for listening i gotta i gotta pull up my running order again this is weve never done a more chaotic pod
