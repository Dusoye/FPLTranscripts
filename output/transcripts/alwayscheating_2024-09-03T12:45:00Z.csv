its like its fine all right we are live sir over we live yep excellent thank you all right hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast thank you for joining us my name is josh happy to be back thank you to pat riley the other pat riley for filling in on last weeks podcast and brandon how are you thank you for asking josh as always im doing great we enjoyed what our friends in the uk would call u a holiday today i think everyone calls it a holiday you mean a bank holiday but i second guess myself like is the bank holiday the same thing as a holiday lets try not to get into it i needed a bit of a i needed a bit of a breather admittedly josh from the events of sunday i think both you and i were riding pretty high with the game week game week three going into sunday well get into it liverpool is a bit of a thorn in our sid didnt enjoy increasing your rank by 35 times in the the final match of the game we before a two we break i dont want to winge too much because the fact that one match did change the rank so much just shows early season blah were all still very tight things will change come game week four but what we need to figure out here josh is whats the plan like if those who dont have salah whats the plan those who dont have holland whats the plan those who dont have i dont know brian and buo do we need a plan there yep i dont know about him bomo the other the other two i talked about it a little bit i have not shouted this out yet but just as a heads up because i dont want to like get into too much we promote enough stuff brandon including our own stuff on here but i did start a substack for always cheating a couple of weeks ago called the fpl scouting notebook of course were not planting the many great newsletters that are out there brandon but this is just quick thoughts from every match right so i did this afternoon im enjoying these i spent like a good two hours this afternoon theyre great theyre honestly great when you had this idea you pitched it to me and you were inspired by some nfl fantasy content that you were consuming yep where is the very short brief quippy digestible fun email that you can just read with your morning coffee after the game week is over so just a good compliment to the pod thank well thank you and its been theyre been fun to do i was worried i was going to fade after like one but after three i still feel i still feel good lets see how i feel when im 69m overall but so far i was technically on a green era by the way this week shockingly i was up like it was one of those like 15000 green eras but ill take it so the substack though is just always cheating subcom e easy enough so just always cheating subcom subscribe of course brandon and but lets get back to fantasy proper i it was its one of those weeks where if you had flipped the fixtures id be feeling great right now right as you said its like the timing is a big factor here right if we had ended with the man like if man city at west ham had been the final match of the gw you and i would be over the moon right about this this miracle green arrow i be id be talking instead of i just got a green like i nicked a green arrow it would be i cannot believe i got a green arrow after this weekend right so its its all about how you how you look at it for me we were were separated what like by one point and last week maybe separated by 5 to 10 points im on a distinct red arrow like i went from 540k to just the wrong side of a million so its strange but i was honestly a little a little flabbergasted at that salid what wrong can you can you share your team with me so i can take a take a look here im curious sure ill bring where did it all where did it all go wrong i want to i want to know so you can see here i started game week one 21 mil and now were at one point not one mil points are 70 points game we rank of 4m it went wrong in all of the like like marginal characters morgan rogers is probably the biggest person to blame here because he and jia pedro were my two transfers i dropped the injured salanki for jaia pedro and thought well this is a uniquely difficult fixture for brighton going to the emirates i and it looked like brighton were going to be held until the declan rice red card y but that was a very nice goal by brighton ultimately interesting write ups in the athletic about how arsenals defense was a perhaps a little shambolic prior to the red card but i did feel like this goal was coming and until they got gonna have chances right i me even man city man city have been conceding coned multiple goals for the season but the other teams always going to have chances so its you can kind its like its easy to like rewrite the narrative but it is it is rare to trans because you brought in pedro and then you put him first on your bench which i assume was a like a price change thing right i think he was set to rise and then you assumed that salanki was set to fall he has still not fallen once salani was locked because of injury who bloody knows sure and i i did bring j pedro in largely because of both salani p perhaps going down and pedro going up and then morgan rogers because i started him i thought he i was impressed by his performance against arsenal and i thought surely he would get a return against lester and aston villa just even though theyre its its onas team at this point he looks so strong in the midfield its interesting because theyre the theyre the same price and morgan rogers is the number 10 and anana is ostensibly like a box to box he is doing what my goodness why am i get his name the player who was their box tobox player last season who was nam douglas lise douglas lise thank you and may be that about unai emory system that just lends itself to a little bit of freedom from these deep line players or its just fluky but it does feel a little unusual that you would go from this deep line player that was a great fantasy quite because he luis was a pretty good fantasy asset last season and for onana to be in the boat now and its like but still i dont think i would recommend an nana transfer his first goal came from a set piece so that one is like not a necessarily would you qualify as an open play goal sure but i am i am a little bummed about how i set up my team going into this weekend but you see the logic anthony gordon has been a differential for me and he got his goal last week which was very useful and now hes traded with esi and the problem is esok is owned by a much larger percentage of fantasy managers and then guys like smith row and cona very quiet diego jot the liverpool player that the one liverpool player that you and i both own was the was the guy to not have this particular game week i okay so i was feeling very heres the heres the silver lining i was feeling very bad about dean henderson after game week two and i was already teetering and saying i want a premium goalkeeper four points from dean henderson feels like he got a 10pointer and hes got a nice home fixture coming up in game wi four so ive gone from maybe strategizing changing my goalkeeper you get this is my editorial comment here is that i think you just get you get too worked up about goalkeepers and its like its a real like dont sweat the small stuff thing to me because its just very hard to get it right the difference between a expensive goalkeeper and a in a in a in a mediocre goalkeeper is marginal in terms of the total point like maybe in a particular run of fixtures you want the better keeper but even though theres theres theres reasons why right that weve talked about many times before why you dont want the more expensive keeper right like lets say you get david rya well what happens if arsenal have an incredible run of attacking fixtures which they do in like seven or eight weeks youre going to want to have one of those arsenal defenders right because theyre great at theyre theyre great at hoovering up bonus points and matches where they keep clean sheets sleep in particular gabriels good on set pieces ben white gets tag returns but then you probably are going to want to have two arsenal attackers as well right and so and so suddenly you have this keeper who probably has a slightly better chance of keeping a clean sheet than a 45m keeper but youve gobbled up one of your arsenal spots right now that cant be a double up in the midfield or hts or whatever and he also was almost never going to get bonus points during the good fixtures right because theyre going to keep clean sheets and theyre going to be fournil wins like that right and even if you just like look at like just sheer like clean sheet odd percentages right its like a team that is heavily favored to keep a clean sheet in a match and you look at like the vegas odds or whatever and its like theyre maybe 50 at absolute best to keep a clean sheet right and the team that you think is going to get smoked is like 40 right so the difference is pretty low so i didnt mean to go on a little micro rant there i just think like i i think henderson is a perfectly viable goalkeeper for the premium goalkeeper i think the interesting one would be allison and that becomes a discussion of where youre at with your budget and trent and because trent is remarkably more expensive than any of these guys and i think then allison becomes an interesting points grabber for all those clean cheats and possibly covering your rivals who do have tr but anyway i dont totally disagree with you and now that the vibes have shifted it was the great goalkeeper vibe shift in game we 3 for me and im feeling just fine with dean henderson what about you lets lets throw your team up on the screen so well theres some big news which is that i have activated my wild card that happened a couple of hours ago i i just was looking at everything that was happening looking at price changes looking at my squad looking at who i wanted and i was like this is going to be so exhausting to like to get there through normal transfers right its its like its such a mess and im gonna get crushed on team value which happened to me last season and it drove me absolutely crazy at the end of the year which and honestly part of it was just me being a little disengaged i think early on in the season last year and i was i was to this is i think a real a real problem and i you probably if youre as disengaged as i was feeling last year youre probably not even listening to this pod right now because its hard to part of the problem is that when you get like i was off to a bad start i both of us were last season and i was like screw this like i felt like i just was like a little like whats the word i dont know just salty about it right and i think like the problem then is that you dont you like get away from pl strategically right because youre like im just i dont want to think about fpl for like its international break is here im going to go 11 days without thinking about fpl right youre not a high performance manager at that point exactly and so in a window like that you might be a 0 56 pr like every option that might have been available to you in wild card is now done right and so i was just thinking about it i was like well i have to decide like before we do this podcast if i going to do it or not okay because i because it was just like i dont even have like pedro the way you do right and so and so i started tinkering a little bit and i was like i just i think i like this team quite a bit better and because you can s save five transfers i dont see as much i dont see as much of a rationale for like waiting for like a rainy day to play my wild card right it was like im just going to wild card and be slightly aggressive although i wouldnt say that im wild carding from like a position of great strength im like 984 th000 overall im doing fine right like its its not like a bad start but like i just dont look at my squad and think like im gonna crush it these next few weeks right i what i look at and think my god how much more how much further down am i gonna go over the next three weeks before i can fix it with transfers right and so i think that was what motivated me to go ahead and play the wild card but just before we do that ill share my screen with you and again i know were sharing screens and we do this is still a podcast this is a an audio medium and so i dont want anyone to think that but i think just in general its just that you and i can look at this together right while were of course while were while were talking about it and ill just try to be conscious that i dont make reference to video stuff that that people who are listening cant see so but 77 points in the game week it was i thought like again i f if solid doesnt absolutely go off then im feeling pretty good about this game week right i was going into that liverpool match i was around 300k overall and feeling feeling pretty solid about pushing on and i think after that match i think the interesting thing is joda who you mentioned already and what we should do there its a question i havent fully resolved yet because i dont i dont know the best i dont know what the answer is with him like i think hes fine i think hes a good asset its its like the fact that david louise has been out scoring him the last two weeks like i still feel like joda is the preferred option of the two 75m liverpool midfielders do you feel like l david louiz is or douglas gez too many lou diaz do you think you feel like luis diaz has now supplanted joda as the preferred second midfields option on liverpool well if you just take the fpl points yes but how can we then you put yourself into this position of trying to predict the future do we think that doo jota has had particularly bad matches the last two matches no do i think that the team functions better without j jota in the starting 11 100 not so it then it becomes a very difficult question of how long of a view do i want to take how patient do i have to be to get the value that i need out of diogo jot and thats just a harder question to answer i dont feel like if youre if youre thinking i just want to spend one free transfer over the international break jota to lis diaz doesnt feel like a worthwhile transfer to me not at all if not a step backwards right it almost feels its a little bit its not quite the same because not as extreme but its a little bit like the morgan rogers onana situation right its like looking at what weve seen so far youd think maybe onana is the guy right but then if you look at it more rationally and you just look at like positioning and right like shots and youre like i you still feel like you want i think joda and you want morgan rogers of if you had to pick two of those four so but i think i think its tricky and so i unfortunately i think what bumed me out a little bit my my transfer are both bust i brought in concept and smith row i think honestly this is why i have decided to wild card by the way too is i just i just made too many mistakes in my in my gw one draft and i just cant quite solve them all through transfers and i have lewis hall who set to drop in price tonight well see if it happens right the price changes have been a little unpredictable but hall set to drop in price i havent even had a chance to move him yet right because i had to move k quansa i had to move anduku those are the the biggest ones but even like sun like i feel a little caught out right now with sun i got a great return from him game week to but at the moment it feels like i have the fourth best of the expensive midfielders i have the fourth best one right and so that feels like another issue that i want to solve but i and if i could just go from like sun to palmer or whatever or even just get solo with like two transfers i i might have considered just doing that even if i had to burn four possibly but its the fact that i have to fix all these other issues still right that make it that make it tricky and so even harwood bellis even a pre 60 minutes not that anyones gonna lose sleep over your like last guy totally may maybe harwood bellis too exactly so well youre were going to say something about flicking youve got beef with flein now ah hes trash whole defense is trash i dont know im sure itll im sure when gw 38 rolls around flein will be the third highest rated keeper on the season and i will miss out on every amazing return of his im sure thats true but i dont i dont i like this brighton team brandon i want to continue liking this brighton team im not positive i can like this brighton team if i have right brenford both but maybe hell trans like them all maybe hell move in january to brighten who knows right so so im referring to b no branford i want to continue enjoying watching this brenford team play and i cant right now because i am im stricken with anxiety over when fleckin is going to concede a goal and it seems to come later and later each week and so and so i just want i want this trash out of my team i like brenford long term i think its around gw seven maybe when they have a when they started a nice run of fixtures and i think johan wisa is somebody that we havent talked about too much but with ivan tony you officially is it did he go to saudi arabia wherever he went i havent seen any news yet no i think that transfer happened on deadline day so with tony gone and the forward they signed injured until like the end of december yoan wi has its its his spot right and hes hes a six million forward who is like i dont hes not like the most he doesnt blow you away when you watch him in these matches but its like its a competent team right its like a well coached wellmanaged team like if you had to pick between mooney and vissa for example like maybe its a bad example because vissa already has a couple goals in the season but theres just something about like i just feel a little more confident that like that were going to get some something more out of out of visa right like you like looking five 10 weeks ahead i like that ando and visa together theyre like a great duo and thats they theyre like just one of those lowkey fantasy duos where youre like well you could get either one depending on your budget and your team set up and you probably get the share of some spoils from whatever goals that brenford are going to score exactly right and thats and emomo is a little harder to get because hes 7m maybe maybe e turns into emomo at some point for some managers right like theres a thats an easy sideways move so those are those are some things that ive been kick i dont have visa in my my squad right now they have a couple tough fixtures coming up so i think hes hes like he works a little better as a later transfer but i will share with you brandon this is like a first a first draft of a of a wild card team so take it with a a big grain of salt i i dont i have not firmed up where what im thinking here i think the goalkeeper spot is the first question for me and if you were making a goalkeeper transfer this week or youre wild carding i think that kappa and like and im like firmly in the like i wish i could just like roll out i would rather take an extra four million and just get a zero every week right like if that were possible like i just coldkeepers are so worthless in this game i feel like and so its coming down to kea and dean henderson for me as my as my goalkeeper pick and okay i dont know im i thought kea had kea had a nice performance in his opening match they did concede a couple of goals but i dont know i feel like he might be hes hes a talented keeper i dont know youre stretching youre stretching well listen you find me a keeper that you want right now yes if you include allison then yes but right like in the sub bracket find one that like gets you excited sure theres theres no way to win or lose this conversation youre going from flecking to flecken and that and that and thats fine on a wild card you have that luxury get whatever flecken you want born the fixtures coming up theyre home hosting chelsea followed by liverpool then its a good coupling with southampton and leester and then the fixtures are diabolical starting in game week 8 city its its true tricky it is the question is whether you should even look like you want to look in the medium term right but like i think the problem is if you look at it through a i was thinking about that i was like well which like cheap keeper has already gotten a couple of tricky matches out of the way and unfortunately that might lead me back to flecken which like that would be depressing if i like wild card had flecken out and then wild card him back in days quite an incredible story you just wild carded the same team you had in gw one just go can you im you just went straight back no i think i might end up with dean henderson though i do feel better about it now that gayi stayed right i think that and they did they did make a center back signing as well and so i think i think theyre okay im still amazed that they let anderson go i felt like he was good for them last season i dont get it either good has he started yet for fulam i probably started in the efl cup match and at that point i thought he was like a dead certain to like start every other fulham game from here to eternity and he did not start over the weekend it was depp and bie again so well see ultimately hes destined for the starting 11 its just a matter when i feel like you wouldnt they and they must have given him some assurance right like you wouldnt he wouldnt leave a starting spot at palace to be a backup hes captaincy material like as soon as soon as karney gives that up fpl captaincy right because youve been youve been captaining youve been captaining tom kerney in fpl for the first three weeks you call me captain carney and thats that ill never change ill never change i refuse so so my backline is keeping robinson of course i think he is absolutely fantastic and it just like hes turned into such a like amazing fantasy asset because hes now getting attacking returns consistently enough that even when they concede he is hes valuable right hes got two assists and two bonus in the season and i feel good about him at 45 i think kana is another one where its unfortunate that they conceded to lester a little late in that one as well but i feel i feel good about him too right its just a cheap way into a competent defense lewis dunk i think is another one where its hes 45 and again talk about a like captaincy captain center back player right hes just like a super reliable solid can nick a couple of headed goals every season type option so its its a pretty cheap back line and then ive got celba as my one expensive defender the one question for me is whether theres any shortterm value in moving celba to van djk for a couple of weeks possibly moving back to sba at some point but at the moment my plan is just is just to roll with cba and save my transfer and then ive gone with axel tonbe as my as my four million defender you pick its its like its like the goalkeeper thing right you pick you pick a four million guy theyre all terrible just dont spend more than four million right right and and i dont know like there are like moments when brighton seem saucy and fun and youre like well maybe theres like a match where they just everyone get it switch feels saucy totally why do i keep saying brighton i got brighton on the brain youre im counting two brighton players in this team so and thats thats more brighton players than you often see so youre definitely thinking about it our friend james holland who came on the patreon pod whos a been a long time i switch season ticket holder fan is hes he told us he picked i switch to optimistic as he is to finish 15th in the table youd think theres some points that have to be coming for this team sooner or later they picked up a point against fulham for instance and leaf davis the le leaf legend we need some little nickname for him leaf legend though picks up i think he got an assist and two bonus in this match so he is he is off and its god if he was four million hed be like one of the most players in fantasy but at 45 its just a little too much a little too much switch for my blood brandon but at 4m lets lets lets lets toss one of their options on the bench through the midfield the big thing here is i have palmer and solo so am i chasing points i dont know im probably getting like the second and third best fantasy access in the game so i dont feel like that bad about it and part of what i like about it is i feel like theres a version of this like i feel like theres a rotatable like a rotating third forward that i can use here as well and so i it almost feels like ive got a little too much money in my midfield still but at the moment ive got smith row who im holding on to maybe i shouldnt be i i thought he was just like i dont know he was out of it in that if switch m i he had a couple chances like right before he got subbed right like and that was i think i think what youre seeing with smith row is just a young man who has played his entire life at arsenal at one club and as talented as he is going to a new club across town its its not easy especially for the younger players and hes being a lot is expected of him like hes coming now into fulham and they expect him to be like the general of that attack its going to take time i think and i agree like he looks a little you hes not there yet hes not finished and so he might turn into morgan rogers which would save me like 045 that probably that probably is the sensible move right honestly i could get onana if i wanted but i still feel like i feel like rogers is still is still probably the more sensible pick there it would also make a for a little bit less of a benching headache i just feel like its always tricky when youve got when youve got eight midfield starters right that you want to play like or when youve got three forwards and five midfield ers all of whom are competing and every single week youre i dont like having that headache in fantasy right let me ask you this about this draft and we talked a lot about fifth midfielder before gw one and i ended up with a 55 bron diaz is my fifth mid youve thought about this a little bit youve gotten off harry winks you now have your fifth attacker would u be sano or smith row at 55 where are you at with the 45 guys like morgan rogers is as low as you think you can go given what weve seen so far no i i think so just because i do think that like you get quite a lot from him at five i think hes 51 now right you get quite a lot from him at 51 is that worth the extra 05m or point6 or whatever probably is honestly and i think what makes it and so just to quickly go through my midfield right now ive got salah palmer e sano and smith row and sano to me is just correcting a mistake akake and it was the impetus for the wild not i shouldnt say the impetus but one of the reasons i was convinced we can call the empatis of salwa this sal thats right salo is absolutely 100 the impetus even cole palmer is like a luxury move that you can do when youre wild carding right but the what was seano not having risen in price even once is shocking considering that like in every in every like way that you look at him i feel like hes been fantastic like he the underline stats are good the actual fpl stats are good and he looks awesome right even if youre just watching highlights of these matches like seano is heavily involved right like he looks like hes even even with salanki out hes gonna take on a lot of attacking you a lot of the attacking potential and so hes just like a i think for most managers a square peg for any problematic round hole that we have so joe pedro is super cheap for the third forward at 5 5 morgan rogers is as we discussed like probably the cheapest fifth mid youd want and sano is hes 55 right so yep its rare that people are paying enough attention to bourne myth and have a 55 hole they need to fill unless youre in a situation like this where i just did it last week i got i got smith row over smania but like i think but if youre trying to get an expensive if youre trying to fit three premiums into your squad youre going to need to fill it out with some of these cheapies right and i think the problem then is you dont necessarily have players you want to start every single week right and i think thats where to get back to your question about the more expensive bench option right i think thats where the having a more expensive player makes more sense because you can talk like you can you can rotate them a little bit and so so then my forward line and this to me is the problem is is it a problem you tell me right and so the problem is that i have i have holland hollands not going anywhere and and i just dont care i dont i dont like any version of my squad that doesnt have him in it i dont care how much how many other spots i can upgrade okay like maybe im missing whos talking about getting rid of holland at this point well just a lot of people are like theres like the advanced stats folks are like dropping him in the short ter i dont know probably not before the brenford match but maybe ahead of game with i dont i dont want to get into it because my goal this season is not you and i are not going to no flame wars this year brandon were on were on a firmly on were were just this is a friendly world were not gna get our were not gonna stick our foot in the were the swit of fpl exactly were an island onto ourselves and so what i have is i i have holland i have jaa pedro who i honestly to me thats another mistake that im correcting i just i should have been on him from well i its i dont know i i dont need to kick myself too much because the player that i got was chris wood and chris woods been excellent and in all three of the matches including gw two where he blanked he was good and im sure a lot of people out there have not watched like any forest so far this season but hes been great and hes hes in this last match he i think he took five shots in the match scored a goal had a brace late that got chocked off played the full 90 minutes i think there was some risk like earlier about whether he was gonna be rotating a little bit but hes hes been i think hes been absolutely fantastic so far this season and so my feeling with him now is maybe i just keep him and i just and i just rotate him a little bit and that hes probably solid enough that you dont necessarily need to move him for one of these other options that have been a little inconsistent and so the problem though is theres no wally watkins in this squad theres no theres no eso right like theres a number of players that that i cant have and thats just the price you pay if youre going to have holland salah and palmer right thats a thats almost what is that 27 its almost 40m of my 60m budget in three players its absolutely insane right the gamble youre making here which is i think why youre making it is its one of the bet better bets you could place is youre youre taking cole palmer over a second striker youve got two third tier strikers and cole palmer i think thats i think thats exactly right and and also banking that like these 55m guys or what ill just use starting prices here right but the 55m guys sano smith row pedro morgan rogers you pick the three or four options there that those players can be good enough right that they can get you to like a 65 is option be best as ivanka trump would say i dont know what that i have no idea what thats reference to but so thats thats where i am and so that was unexpect i i thought i would drop that on you brand you didnt know i was going to reveal i had no idea and then you showed us a draft i thought you were going to tease it for next week we got a whole international break to work through but still youre going to see a whole different draft when you turn tune in to always dream next monday very likely exactly and and honestly i will say to and not to do a second shout out for the substack but part of the value of doing this is i have been watching match highlights of everything that i missed over the weekend and you do like you do like you dont have to be ready to subsec do this but like if youre if youre like taking fantasy seriously you should be watching highlights you dont have to like they always whatever im sure im sure you can watch them in any country youre in right but in like nbc and peacock they have the extended highlights and right and sometimes you look at them and you like h like this is like 13 and a half minutes i dont have this much time but for whatever reason they decide to spend four and a half minutes on the lineups at the start of every one of these and then they show you like the opening minute of the match right so all you have to do is you pull up the extended highlight you skip forward about 3 minutes and 40 seconds and then youre where you want to be so youre watching like a f minute highlight package and i think it is a quick way to be like wow like morgan rogers is one of these players who like if you just looked at his returns youre like ah like three straight blanks i think especially in those first two matches you saw somebody who was involved right in the villain this is why you brought him in but like had a game week three but you just you see things that you dont necessarily see if youre just looking if youre just watching the featured matches and and then looking at fpl results right points well ill be ill be jealous of you having mosala going into game week four i my current plan is i have to roll unless i want to take a hit to get mo which i dont think i do i think ultimately what i need is two free transfers to get gordon and jot out and salah for a fifth mid any chance that you would wild card yourself have i talked you into it a little bit if i play well i dont look at my team and say i see problems when i look at my team but no not im not feeling the stress that you clearly and youre not necessarily feeling the stress i understand youre like you just feel like this is the best strategy for you and i get that what i would say is im feeling very engaged with the game right now like feel like like im im feeling good about like my ability to make confident decisions right and just like trust my instincts a little bit and so thats that was what is what has pushed me to do it right just feeling like lets go for it lets lets try clearly a lot of our listeners are thinking either wild card or the price market is like in full swing right now and going into the international break usually theres a lot of action at the start of the international bre especially the first one when people are like re reine tuning their team and then the market should probably slow down in a few days and you can chill out and take a step back for the middle part of the international break but a couple questions here one from stepen cus who has thoughts on early transfers to navigate price rises price falls earlier in the season and during international breaks and john reynolds has said nobody ever should i use all three of my free transfers during this break so i think from your perspective josh you are seeing these price changes and are thinking thats going to be something youre going to feel the effects of later in the season so and you agree with this right i think of you as somebody whos very like conscious of price changes and like the market and i think its fun to take advantage of it at this point joe pedro is a great example of this where hes going youre going to make money off of this guy over the break and you dont you dont have to bring in these players thinking im a im a 100 believer in jaia pedro you could turn just being a two to three week believer in jaia pedro is going to mean you can make a better financial decision with your team later on in the season and especially when youre looking at that late season wild card the more money you have the better so i am for like playing the price market earlier in the season the trick with early transfers in the international break is lord knows whats going to happen to these guys when they go off to their international teams i think im like more compelled to go for guys in the fpl transfer market who maybe dont have an international call up thats true i theyre not traveling and all that thing and its like situational too right like i feel like if you have like a decent bench like if your bench is decim ated right and like if one more player gets injured then you are absolutely going to have to like and you use like you use your transfer early and like your team is 11 strong right and like one injur is going to kill you then maybe dont use the transfer early but if you have like a little bit of bench dep then i think its fine to go ahead and do it i dont know i dont think like its i dont think we get that many we dont get as many international break injuries as we think we do right its a bit like holiday rotation right this idea that like youve got to go 15 deep on your in your squad for the for the holidays right because theres so much rotation during you december and then you look and youre like everybody played every match its like maybe pep like outside of like man city though youre probably pretty safe well i feel like weve already given a pretty good gift to our listeners there with the wild card talk but we do have a bonanza coming up after a short housekeeping break here

to get those 500 gift cards all right josh now it is time to do our common sense fantasy takes i think you expressing this through your wild card are saying 3 weeks is this were at this pivot point where now weve got like critical mass with data information grass test data test we now have real like takes to get us to the next step in the season and i think the real goal here is to do what i think i think especially because were were we have we have two weeks right to do some thinking ahead of ahead of gw four and so theres its a chance for us to like take a step back and sometimes again i talk about like the forest from the trees and i think i got caught up in this thinking last season which was i was letting other people take the temperature of the season right and like when it came to transfers or went to wild card do all this stuff i was relying way too much on what other people were saying right and it was because i felt like i didnt have my own rules of thumb about each squad right heuristics if you will brand if i didnt have these 20 heuristics that were about to that be a great that make sure that no one listened to this episode great keyword just became a great title for the podcast episode so and again weve already like were like 50 minutes in already but were going to do these are going to be like one lightning round big picture thought for all 20 clubs okay so just like quick thought and this were going to keep this fantasy focused right but like but just one oo the lady round is on so lets get going here let me just going to sitp for my i have a rare that i pod with a cpe glass brand we have a comment in the in the chat from our friend pat who was on last week he says youre sipping on a fancy glass you can check us out on screen on our youtube page but what you get so you got what you got my wife my wife turned in the final draft of her book to her publisher and so we were you played tiny part in that as well brandon you got a got my fingers and everything i fingers in that so not getting it published but just in the actual design so were just supporting the real talented people in our lives thats what we do were celebrating tonight so thats thats amazing all right so thats im extra spicy this evening so lets go into it i think i think the more interesting way to do this maybe i was going back and forth i was like should it be alphabetical should it be table order and ive decided that table order is the way to go because ultimately the teams at the top of the table are the ones that fantasy managers are tend to be more focused on and so i think it makes sense to start there and so were just going to go one through 20 and and talk about these clubs and then and again were g to keep it fantasy focused and then next week well do more of a proper game week four preview but theres no point in doing that ahead of a whole week of international travel and fixtures and things like that right because therell be some therell be some breaking news half the half the league might move to fenerbache brandon in the next handful of days right so we just we just dont know by the way i saw a picture of jaden sancho on the pitch on sunday and i was like i somehow just completely missed that he moved i and i know i knew there was like rumors about him moving but him moving to chelsea i started laughing when i saw it because i was like what is hes like the ninth like i dont know whatever i we dont need to get into that do we that could be our an ear our thats thats thats a hard pass too much oxygen has been devoted to the chelsea youre right youre right youre right youre right what i what i think is interesting about it is man utd came up with nothing because for a while there was going to be a swap with raheem sterling raheem sterling ends up at arsenal and man utd like heres who did they get they didnt get anybody theyre still playing marcus rashford so thats very fun for them mason mounts injured now too right so its like so all so lets start at the top of the table here heres my first thought on mince maybe well go like back and forth how about that i do one you okay and then if you have an extra you have an extra thought we can we can add it but my first thought on man city to kick things off here and first overall at the moment tied with liverpool on nine points theyre head theyre head on go different theyre tied on goal difference but theyve scored two more goals my first thought of man city is that the defense probably needs to be reevaluated and like we probably my thought is that we shouldnt be drawing any real conclusions about their defense at the moment because the like rod has they just havent had roder for the first three weeks and he is he though not a defender himself is incredibly important to the defense and not only is he not there to protect the defense but i also wonder if it has forced them to play gardial as a as a center back right like i wonder if pep has not had the confidence to like let him push forward more right as a result of not having rodri in the center because i feel like we saw a more attacking leftwing version of him in the past and hes hes been pretty pinned i feel like to the to the back line that is interesting i feel like guardi its its just more of i think its less about the form in the tactics and more gardial might just be a slow starter we saw this with him at the start of last season and city just seemed to find that like that destruction rhythm midway through there theyre are oneman fantasy team right now and the pleasure and maybe when foden is i dont know but at the moment its youre right its its a oneman team and so theres theres not like the problem is theres no value anywhere else right its not like its not like theres a 45m defender in there there is and rico lewis but i dont necessarily trust him with rod coming back right to be a consistent starter right because rico lewiss great cool fantasy value is that inverted fullback thing that he does and now walker finally got on the pitch in gw three so thats just like a firm wait and see so for liverpool then its like i think the common sense take here is its the complete opposite of man city and that liverpool are the man city of this season as far as fantasy where youre like how am i going to fit all of the guys who i want into my team and you would want for me on a midfielder they dont have any forwards so you dont have to worry about that but whats fascinating about this new season with liverpool is i think i was able to talk myself into not having mosal game week one because i thought arnie slots coming in who knows what the level of discontent or discom population is going to be and what we have seen is whether its to do with slot or whether it is just these players being veteran winners is this liverpool team looks like they want to send this version of liverpool off into the sunset on a real high from van djk to salah and everyone in between theyre just like in some incredible form and i think going to be dealing with liverpool assets all season for the good like so get as many liverpool assets as you can a pronto and thats the other issue with my wild card is i only have one at the moment and salah its hard to get even more than one in if youre g to go expensive it may be that cole palmer just cant fit that would thats the only that if i did that i could i could still have joda and trent like thats interesting does like a 45m defender and cole palmer is that worse than joda and trent like its a interesting question well spoiler alert for whatever were going to say about chelsea but i do think that its much its overstated with cole palmer right now i do not think that he is necessary for a fantasy team thats doubled with salah and holland okay i think hes and its like i love i have nothing bad to say about the player and the fantasy its the price the price is illogical if youre going for holland plus salah and i see no way around that and that might be me just playing as a template manager but i just think its its true its facts no i think its true i think the part of my thinking there was i could maybe do a little back and forth with him and saka right like like follow like following the fixtures a little bit this feels like i dont think ive ever heard you talk about swap in swap hoke pokei i think were we always you and i dont like to say it because its hokey pokei in america its hokey kokei in the uk were very aggressive and were very finger pointing centric here in here in the us we poke people exactly we hoke and we poke we also hoke people we do both so i think its you might you might be hon again this is exactly why this exercise is useful right because when you look at in a big picture sense youre like yes what do i think about liverpool what i think about them is that i want three of their assets right and so that is thats very interesting so thats thats something for me to think about a little bit that would also enable me to maybe get ali watkins or dare i say nico jackson but lets lets lets lets put a button in that for a second lets go on to brighton and hve alby and brandon theres a lot to say here we talked about pedro already i think mina is an interesting talk about another 55m player i think hes playing super well hes the the right winger for for brighton and finally picked up an assist it was one of those like rebound assist but he honestly could have scored on the chance right and so he was well in and so i think i think the mina is a good you mean like im not like first name on the wild card level right but i just think hes like i think hes he looks good i think the whole team i just like i just admire brighton so much like i admire like every like the way that they do business while still seeing competitive is super impressive to me like its theyre theyre like they should be like the envy of every like non top cl and they make hiring new managers look easier than like most other teams in europe herler is like hit the ground running he looks great looks confident the team looks great and im with you on mta is like moma on the right hand side but for cheaper so i think thats a great budget call i think m be 65 or seven and mint is 55 so not as not as like polished maybe as yes correct yes i would agree with that matoma pro price rose up to 66 so theres a 11 one savings there big difference then huge all right so were on to arsenal now aral the take here is i the take is it changes week to week after gw one i thought the only player anybody needed in their squads was kai hyberts after gw two i thought the only player anybody needed in their squad was bai osaka after game after gw or rya for that matter arsenal are simil so like i was saying with liverpool get them all arsenal is like pray that youre lucky week to week that you have the guy who gets the points and that goes for their defenders as well is gabrielle finally gonna get his corner kick goal this match who knows so arsenal i think have presented decent enough value but they appear like theyre going to be a frustrating team to buy into fantasy wise because you can always justify having them and they might not pay you back the way these like surefire bets from liverpool and erling holl might what do you think about saka like three returns in three but its like it doesnt its like he feels like he just feels like such a step below palmer salah and and and holland as like as like the like its like a premium asset i disagree in that i think saka will outscore for palmer this season i think hes a better pick than palmer okay all right im excited to get to our palmer section then i want i want i want to see what you have to say there but lets move on to but just like just real quick on saka i dont totally disagree with you on the skepticism there because the question remains saka ceiling is its fuzzy i dont want i dont know what it is so thats the red flag for exactly because its hes super consistent and thats its hugely valuable but its like if you look at like a luis diaz and i know small sample etc eta we always have to say that but like if you look at like what diaz or joda have done in the first like three weeks for example right its like theyre not necessarily as consistent but they are like because theyre a little more explosive in terms of their returns it averages out to the same right especially when you factor in the three million price difference between them right so i dont know theres theres theres something to think about there all right lets move on to newcastle my thought on newcastle is im impressed that theyre in fifth like it feels like feel like they shouldnt like theyve had three pretty underwhelming performances to start the season they locked into a win versus spurs they were under the c by spurs for a good deal of that match but you do i do tip my hat to newcastle for grinding out thats a how you have to do it some weeks y i feel maybe a little bit more optimistic like there are like green shoots for newcastle and i think i think we will see much better from them maybe the international break will be rejuvenating just out of curiosity at newcastles fixtures coming up its wolves away in game we four followed by fulham city everton brighton its not like a great run to be honest mix bag so i think ill be ready to get rid of gordon for sure coming going into game week five and that will hopefully work into my solem move that makes that makes sense so not a lot maybe its just theres not we dont have a lot positive to say because we started out this season i started the season with two newcastle i wanted to have three and i had to move out of gordon at the last minute for i almost did nick poop is exactly so its like but theyre theyre putting together some u i dont know they just its it has not been inspir like you said maybe the fact they havent played inspired and there theyre still seven from nine is says something all right so that we move now to this ones pretty easy its its exactly what we said at the top of the show ivan tony is officially out of the mix therefore you are free to get momo and visa and thats all you need to know their pictures are bad coming up so this is something you can put a pin in and come back to but thats those are the thats the real deal thats the news but they and they and they do get better right because i was i was looking earlier and they are i think its and by the way and bomo is now up to fifth overall in points for midfielders like he is he is doing quite well and were we probably have to like start taking him more seriously as a as a buy but once you get past city away spurs away in four and five its a nice run they have three home fixtures in four one of those home fixures zip switch at home fulham bournemouth everton lester especially if youre if youre targeting in those like visa right theres a its a nice nice run and theres there i think that could be interesting so all right so lets move on to aston villa we did talk about we we talked about onana and rogers a fair amount already so weve already done our villa section think about the defense on villa because thats emory his calling card has been defense typically so what its four goals conceded you should be able to freeze the the top of the table here like kind like an excel so that i could see but i what is it four goals for four goals against then for them i just dont see it as a problem long term right the personnel hasnt changed they have lost douglas louise but i just have a lot of respect for emory as a manager right i just think hes gonna sort it out they still have emy martinez and so i think its just fluky right like they absolutely could have kept a clean sheet in that lester game right it was like they lester had one chance and that was the one they scored on and so just happened to fall to the goat exactly so okay so i think the frustrating thing for villa is they just havent become as fantasy relevant as we expected them to be and by the time they might be ready then champions league will begin totally and itll be the added layer of anxiety of whats gonna whats watkins minutes he still going to be a 65 minute sub yep exactly its hard to say and with duran playing so well right i think thats it complicates things because you dont need watkins to play the full 90 every match i you have seen a good amount of squad depth at villa at the start of this season so thats at least encouraging in terms of what how maybe emory wont have to rotate the starting 11 so much its just that hes just going to have the limit guys minutes match to match all right bourn myth in eighth position theyve got two draws and a win theyve had to grit them out that draw against forest was a last minute sano goal and then and violation of a of a complete supporter group in everton this weekend just like thoughts and prayers go out to them and to sean ds team but does he make it through the international break like its i its a little bit like man utd and that like where do you start with all of the problems at this club like new owners thats not going that that might be a start but thats going to its a longterm thing new manager i dont know squad just doesnt seem very good anyway were talking about bournemouth and its the opposite i think bournemouth theyre under the radar right now lest you forget they have a fantastic manager and weirdly a squad thats more cohesive dare i say better than you think the fpl takeaway is what your wild card showed and sano is a legitimately good fantasy pick expect more returns from bournemouth as we go theres i know i talked about like brighton being the envy of the midtable or whatever you want to call it i dont mean that in a in a derogatory way but like i its almost like bournemouth are like the envy of like the teams that should be in the bottom its like they dont have like a huge budget its like theres theres like not like theyre just but its like almost impossible to imagine them going down this season right like theres just something about the like the quality of their like they a good coach that its like theres enough competent players in that squad and its its its its impressive like this has nothing to do with fantasy but like theyre just i like theyre like a fun team to watch i think too like they ive enjoyed watching them bournemouth if youre if youre watching or listening we admire you all right we admire you im glad this im glad this one fell in your lap not inam forest chris wood i think hes been ive talked a lot about chris wood so far have you i dont know how much forest youve seen at all but like do you have any thoughts on chris wood never primary screened forest this season second screen or goal rush situation im impressed that wood has hes hes generated the fantasy points he has the consistency so thats great i have i have no quarrel with him great i think the question is whens the right time to get off of chris wood its sort like youve got the hes already given you the gift now you go to a party and you dont want to outstay your welcome i think thats right and i think that he is i but theres something to be said whether i keep him on wild card or not theres something to be said for a like like a forward who can return in bad fixtures that is not a guarantee like we like weve seen many times over the years forwards like who like they have a great run of fixtures like hes cheap like surely hell get something in those matches right but chris wood is one of those players who hes not like when they play a good squad hes not going to get a ton like he might not even get a single shot right but when they play a bad squad hes gonna get a hand shots hes probably gonna score right because hes like a pretty accurate shot taker and i think he took five shots so hes hes the goal scor was pretty was like the edge of like its a pretty bad goal for who are they playing to cons seed but it was but anyway so i think that hes impressed i think morgan gibbs rogers has had been off to a nice morgan gets white excuse me i got they were playing they were playing wolves and wolves is we dont have to talk about them for a few team spur spurs is interesting to see spurs at this point of the table where you think that maybe they were going to get off to a better start you one and one four points and their attack just hasnt gotten off the ground apart from the explosion that they had in gw 2 and they fell back to earth against newcastle and you saw those same issues that you saw last season with anges system where when it when it starts grinding to a hal it does and they cant y keep a clean sheet so i was f just the common sense fpl take here is all that said pedro porro is the fantasy option and then becomes a do you view pedro poro as a season keeper and if you do then i think hes just a very logical guy to get whenever it is that is convenient to you if you want to spend more transfers in your defense then i think pedroo you dont necessarily he doesnt feel like a hes compulsory you dont need him right now hes he took so many freaking shots i think he took six shots against newcastle insane if hes taking that many shots its clear that anch has said to him put his arm around him and said go for it my man like and he owns that space at the corner of the 18 yard box hes constantly getting the ball there and he has the he has a great cross and he has the ability to shot to shoot so i love any fullback that is that attacking so thats i think that to me is even a more take a bigger takeaway than what we thought wed be talking about sun salani madison etc theres nothing more to say there and maybe well see a better version of their attack when sank is healthy most likely we will but when will that be i dont know and they have the northland and derby in game week four which is gonna be tough should be interesting match very fun but and with no deck rice too so well they do have their new signing the spanish guy who is just like he got injured too didnt he i think hes i think hes like immediately injured so just like whos the guy who came to arsenal under vanger with a broken back kim krom exactly hes hes been hes been cmed already hell be like a new signing when he joins in november though brandon take us to chelsea well i im gonna trade ill ill trade chelsea and fulham okay even though fulhams your club you tell me i want to hear your co palmer is like wildly inessential rant okay well i dont i think that wolves match where palmer got three assists and a goal inflated our view and it inflated our view of him in many ways it was a great reminder of how incredible a fantasy asset he was last season of course how does that mean that im trying to force this argument that hes not a good as good a fantasy asset as everyone seems to think he is des despite him continuing to acrew fantasy points but he did he did all the dirty work against wolves he got one assist and a yellow card in the match this weekend and he blanked in the first week and everything that we have and everyone has been saying about chelsea remains true about this club is its just in a real moment right now and having of course theyre going to be having an identity crisis and i dont think even though moresa style of football is very attacking i dont think its enough to bring chelsea out of that identity crisis so i think i feel better saying this today and ive got two weeks to not have to eat my words i feel better swerving and fading palmer and taking and getting picks elsewhere with that money i would have spent on him than to have i do think the wolves match just inflated our sense a great hot chip song just turned into a great way to manage your fantasy team all right i think thats fair and now i will i will now take fulham because we did our trade here trash team trash stadium trash fans no i no im just kidding no i think no just joking my takeaway is that i dont know just that anthony robinson is jedi is is probably the best fantasy has okay no i do i have because we talked about him already my other take is that i am maybe slightly i cannot believe im saying this slightly interested in adat tror as a fantasy asa i never thought i would be there brand thats a place tell me why just because hes everywhere because he scored a goal no because hes like hes all he like hes just getting in the b hes hes been super aggressive like hes i dont know what his heat map looks like but it feels like hes just like he has a lot of the ball and hes like clearly they have decided like giving him the space to run with the ball is like something thats going to help them i not certain it has helped them so far this season but they hes a strange a strange player to be you rarely ever saw him even at wolves like start on the pitch he was always an impact sub and i thought that was going to be his role clearly marco silva has said we are a more dynamic team with him and this is our best starting 11 hes like consistently starting and hes good going forward is he good at much else its its difficult to say but as like smith row or all these guys are going to be consistent from smith row to a wobi to aatro so i would i would say if you dont if you hold your nose looking at aobi you should probably hold your nose with trii as well i think thats i think thats thats fair i dont think i could bring myself to have hes fun to talk about hes fun to watch hes hes hes just a fascinating player in general by the way going through this table im like i didnt know where anybody was outside of the top four this is this is fascinating so all right so weve were were at club number 13 which is west ham united gosh i am struggling to come up with a take for west ham jared bowen is this seasons version of the good fantasy player that is like too expensive on the hes like on the wrong team and he costs too much like its like hes playing pretty well right hes got lets see what hes got so far hes got a its just a goal and an assist although hes had a couple pretty tough fixtures with villa and man city but hes like but i just at 75 theres like 25 players in that price range and cheaper who i want more than him right so thats i feel like it could go two ways with west ham halfway through the season we could be like its all gone wrong these transfers they made the new managerial app appointment was terrible or it could be like wow they did it they had a great summer and i it could genuinely still go either way it feels like i still could see myself getting su check possibly on my wild card what a what an absolute legend that guy is every just each of the three matches to start the season same old suit check he didnt even start the match this weekend and he still comes on and youre just like anytime you flip on the west ham match hes getting a chance hes everywhere its ridiculous all right lets move on brandon youre next here with man utd man utd and 14th geez slower than i realized well i feel i feel vindicated in my like complete just like a dismay that all these pundits were picking man utd to finish even close to the top four its the song remains the same ten hog is a terrible coach a terri leader of men and their midfield is i mayu cannot a young inexperienced mayu cannot save this man utd midfield theyre gonna struggle all season its a its like and maybe the maybe mayu garnacho like maybe these guys have like another level they can reach out to theyre like theyre like a baseball team that has like a bunch of good players but no allstars like outside of outside of bruno and its like its hard to like to make the playoffs or win the world series when everyones pretty good no ones amazing and its like and its like is zer is zer is he gonna be that guy i dont know its like it feels like every and all of these spots its like theres no like theres no one whos making like a best 11 of the top six or whatever right so and i just wonder if its like and united fans will hate to hear it but i it may be that there were good transfers this summer but you dont have a smart enough person to put them in the right spots and move them around the correct way around the like field i wonder if a new managerial appointment halfway around halfway through the season helps this team if they stay 14th for much longer its its not going to be halfway through the season right itll happen like this fall this autumn so i ios ours you i know we get to see his first we get to see his first couple matches im excited about that well you see i dont think hes going to be managing the us this break i dont think theyve signed the contract is that right i think were still in terms agreed im surprised he didnt get it what he make sure hes got like all the blue mms in his pretty much lets take care of that before this weekend we got we gotta like the world cups coming up all right well lets lets move on to our final handful of clubs here leicester city i i okay ive got a positive takeaway here which is that they might just have enough like premier league pedigree like kicking through the kicking through that squad to stay up this season like theyre i it depends on whether they get an actual like lets lets leave points penalties out of the out of the equation for the moment right because that might come but like theres just like a handful of dudes whove its like i dont know i just feel like if you if you compare like the three promoted teams n have had a few moments but like just feels like lesters like i dont know its like theres enough quality dudes in that squad that i think they can survive i dont know like what do you what do you think i think that i am so biased against steve cooper why are you bu why you about i like steve cooper like i think hes pretty good hes so corny in every like postmatch interview is just platitude after i think youre being lu i think if he looked like no youre youre the one who youre the one whose mind go whos that guy you like whos that guy you like from twister if he looks like if he looked like glen if you look like glenn powell am i saying this stuff youd be all youre youre the one whose mind goes to that i but i dont know they have one point it like l luton town was raising peoples eyebrows at this point luten toown almost survived in all hony if we keep a fantasy focus then how about just jamie vardy right like he might be enough for them i didnt think i didnt think he was going to be anything and and im still not like looking at looking to buy him or anything like that by the way when did they sign i totally miss that they brought in edward did you notice that edward signed for lester i kind edward and jordan iou so they got a couple of crystal palace signes and bobby deckard over reed is in there so theyre theyre next weeks pod we can do a transfer roundup somewhat desperate transfers there i vout face i think is the best fantasy option on this team right now hes already jumped up to 41 based on the setpiece goal that he scored but still he might just be unsexy as he is as a center back the 40 defender to get this james justin aer he used to be he used to be m he used to be mr james justin is it is what is he priced at james justin is he 40 as well 45 see hes properly rated hes properly rated properly rated all right lets move on to crystal palace br crystal palace 16 place lower than i expected so is e too expensive so he has been as noted unlucky he probably should have at least one more goal than he does and hes come close a number of times his finish was elegant this weekend but is he like what you were saying about jared bowen is e is the allure of e an oasis in a desert a mirage i is the oasis a mirage with e and thats my concern with him is youre just paying too much for a guy whos not on a good enough team who sold some very good sturdy parts over the summer youre not paying that much youre paying 69m now like its not crazy given how good he is right like hes taking hes taking shots hes taking a lot of shots and creating a lot of chances that does typically translate into fpl results on a long enough time horizon right and so i still think theres something there its but it has been like a hug disappointing start he got a go and three bonus in the third game we so like we need to stop thinking about him as like a flop right like hes done as well as hes in eok territory where hes been frustrating to own but its not been a complete dis disaster yep and then you come back to that question of how many what results are palace rit large going to get this season all right ip switch josh ip switch like leaf davis like that they have some four million options that we could look at long term i am not buying the hype with with dap like i know he scored in gw three he was it in the liverpool match where he had a pretty big chance in the first half too but hes just 55m and i just dont know that i would be willing to spend more than 45m in any ipswitch players no disrespect to their supporters but like its just like it feels like theyre going to be struggling all year and i just dont want to have anybody from a club like that i do love greaves as their center back and our and again our buddy james holland backed us up there where greaves looks like hes hes locked that spot down and he looks strong on set pieces im moving im moving tbe to greaves as we speak then well done sir all right that brings us to wolves and wolves are in a youre not necessarily in a desperate position ever this early in the season but nothing is gone their way and gary oneal will be very frustrated they have so many to go back to your baseball metaphor they have so many great players who have the tools the tools but its just not coming together and then you get no fantasy output because of that i think what we have to be looking out for is will wolves form coincide with the good run of fixtures and we can consider some of these relatively decently priced midfielders in forwards from like hang he chan to and gomez and all of those guys but there is some its like theres theres like some meat on that bone with this team right but not yet not yet all right southampton tell me how good the briton diaz pick was no im gonna let you slide on that one i gave it to you in the on our deadline aod and that felt like enough so there is okay heres my real take and im sorry in advance but there is nothing to like on this team i cant remember the last time there was a premier league team that was that fielded a full 11 had players and i cant find anything to like we go to everton whos in 20th in a second i can think of plenty of things right like half theres like eight players on that team that i would consider if like with a new manager and a good run of form right its like but like with southampton theres theres like nothing right what about ramsdale coming in at goal hes already had a price drop so hes 44 so its an interesting way to solve a cheap goalkeeper thing thats interesting hes gonna get a ton of saves he is gonna get a ton of saves thats okay thats like half interesting ill give you that one thats half everything else is zero so instead of a zero to 10 ill give them a point were not spit take territory yet but ex do you do you can you count that take at all do you have any like no youre usually meaner about seth anthon than i am i dont know there i it always depresses me when you look at clubs like southampton where they go through they went through the recent moment where everyone was like this is the model club like they were what brighton is now southampton were a decade ago and everyone thought they were doing big think pieces on the back room staff and how they made it all work and brought players through their academy and now its now theyre just like i dont know id compare them to like sunderland like a long a historic club with a great fanbase that has just like all the allure is not apparent at the moment by the way when i made that ip switch def four million defender transfer a minute ago it asked me if i if i wanted to make the change because it would cost me an extra point4 i had not activated my wild card even though i had made like 11 transfers over already so wow no granted im sure i would have caught it over the next two weeks but still that is a reminder when you play your wild card activate your wild card do not forget to do that do not take a minus 36 or whatever because i made like 11 transfers so all right well that brings us to our final club here brandon is that right were were down to everton club number 20th i said a couple vague but nice things about them a second ago do you have any everton thoughts dominick calbert luen finally got some returns this weekend assist yep their defense i is the warning to fantasy managers is like p past glory is not a promise of future returns pford its not that pford is the victim of just bad defending pford has been awful as well which going back to the ramsdale thing like ramsdale is in a position to grab that number one shirt from pford pigford potentially with the managerial change to england i wonder if that is a big motivating factor but their defense has just been so terrible y it does i think its going to be circumstantial with everton do the right injuries to her fantasy template happen to where suddenly dominant covert leen seems like a possible option because right now everton just seem like a team a story to follow but not participate in a lot like theyre there are quality players that keep dropping in price right like so like michael leno is at 44m even bran weight if he eventually comes back hes hes he continues to drop in price hes down to 49 like he was he was quite good even fantasywise he was quite good last season and so like last season they got to a terrible start they red the ship they had a nice close they were very reliable club for clean sheets down the stretch and so i think that they could still figure it out right but they clearly havent yet and its just so funny because its what a difference the final 10 minutes that match makes right in terms of how we how were thinking about them right now because its a could be a dice ball his back and just werent patient enough exactly everythings fine now and now its like is he going to survive the international break its like an absol absolute waking nightmare for everybody exactly so all right well that is thats your rundown and i think were gna were going to end it there brandon so we have a we have another pod that well do next sunday where well cover maybe well cover some of the international or some of the transfer window moves too because i i thought i was following it i missed a bunch of 11th hour things and so we can
