welcome back for another video lets get straight into it for this weeks experts video as we look at the players the top managers in the world are buying and selling captaincy this week the experts team and all the rest so kicking the video off with the usual manager highlight honorable mentioned to last game x biggest score of 75 points which was fpl spaceman at the top of the experts league ascar bor is holding firm with an incredible overall rank with 37k after getting 60 points last game did you manage to beat the experts average score 51 theyre gradually climbing the ranks now after a difficult start for many weve got 10 managers in the top 100k at the moment so what are they doing with their transfers this week then 45 are rolling the transfer 38 making one transfer 15 making two and just two are making three moves theres five experts in total taking a minus four hit this week to fix their teams up no chips active some have played an incredibly patient game with their transfers this season abdala is 300k and hes made the fewest transfers just for all season and hes sitting on five roll transfers as well with that rank easier said than done of course and you have to nail your picks to get into the groove of rolling fair play if any of you have managed to bank four or five transfers so the big question is where is the game shifting this week who are they buying and selling ive made a new improvement to this page which should make the data a bit more digestible all the players have now got positions by their name and at the very top this week its k who 17 of bought which means cal leen unsurprisingly the most sold 23 of dropped him so many managers duped by that promise shown in game three and four when he got two goals and an assist he hasnt scored or assisted in six games since to add salt to the wound his nonpenalty xg over those last six is higher than woods hes got six goals in his last six 545 goal conversion over that run is highest in the league by wood as well however just 2 are buying wood this week it is newcastle arsenal ips which are m city so theres only two games that youd feel happy about starting him in but if you got the rotation players then perhaps he works but beyond that the fixtures dont get much better very mixed ca ticks all the boxes hes relatively cheap good underlying data and if we put up the fure tick all on f page and sort by the next eight game mi we sit top of the table for the best run of all games starting with southampton home gami 11 so last week the harland to salah switch was a huge success are any experts going for it this week 8 of selling harland 9 to buy and sah and theres one manager thats getting to salah without selling harland theyre selling trent and a which makes sense one of the hardest skills in fpl is timing it right when to hop on and off players like if you started this season without harland and then you bought him after that ridiculous start they did the exact opposite of what you want to do there picking him when the form dropped off which no one saw coming lets be honest and you could argue luck plays a massive part there wasnt until gaming a that salah and palmer began moving ahead of points which begs the question is harland worth 153 mil another cheaper assets out scoring him 9 have opted for stran lson overa in some cases thats for budget reasons cal le toa requires 08 mil in the bank br strand lson requires no extra money as hes only 56 mil so comparing their data side by side whos better k or stran len well ks got 212 xgi to st lons 177 ks taken 16 shots this season to his nine and hes created nine big chances to lson zero though lson does have a slightly better xg over the season so hes undeniably a solid pick and any trails k by four points currently the expectation which i think is fair is kya will score more points longer term but you never know of fpl is it time to turn our attention to isach then starting to rise in popularity after three goals in the bounce in all competitions 83 mil is steep lets not forget last season he got 21 goals four assists he started 27 games fixtures ahead include west ham home leicester home and ip switch away the third most saw player is rico lewis who of course was benched last game week he started midweek in the champions leue le while walker was rested so many have called the security of his starts into serious question now as the next few games could suit walkers pace more so if were being realistic of ourselves it would be a massive surprise if lewis started all the next three eight nor is the most bought defender 8 have picked him up some other defenders here include d mesari pedro por and vardal 6 of selling rogers before the liverpool game who did come off after a knock last gameing but hes fine he did start midweek in the champions league viller lost one nil to club brugge he played 66 minutes that match so just two managers have sold robertson and if he still got him it could be time to get rid after his second bench in four league games last weekend simic has been getting the starts ahead of him a is out injured till gamei 12 potentially so 4 have turned to seeno this week and as we saw bourns second on the fixure ticker chart earlier and his 42 shots taken this season can only be beaten by harlands 48 moving on to captaincy then and its probably the most divided its been all season which is exciting and sc bigger rank gains on the table this week if you get it right so we got exactly 50 on salah whos top of the table and then its 28 going for harand 9 sanii 7 bruno 4 sun and then palmer and bumma captain by one each it has been a contrasting week for salah and harland liverpool winning last weekend man city losing salah with two assists as liverpool went on to beat leusen 40 in the champions league while man city fell to spor in 41 including a miss penalty by harlem is this the week harl city bounc back or is it time to cut our losses so with 9 going for sanki theres a genuine case to be made for him after that 16 points of last gameing home to whip switch as well in fact pulling up fpie projections after salah whos on 72 points it is sanki in second with 65 sun is subject to his minutes ive got him on 75 here as a best guess if he makes it to 80 minutes then he moves up to second place of course last game xon only played 55 minutes before coming off on his return from injury for them i can imagine the comments now after seeing 7 of captain in bruno but in fairness its an incredible fixture home to leicester weve got to expect a bounce as well following ten hards departure many players here could be fighting for their spot on the team as well so the likes of gatu could sharpen a big way this week of course brunos nailed regardless in fairness brunos six projected points this week was just 1 behind harland on fp review so not one is effectively just nois in the data so perhaps he is a shout for captaincy let us know in the your captain is going to be and why moving on to the experts team for game 11 and there been a big shake up to the team this week the team is fle and tren 8 nori gabrielle bumo palmer salah simo r kuna and sanki so holland dropped out the team just barely and in comes salah and fleen is also in a variah and calbert lun dropped out for ca as well nine home fixes in the team this week looking well set up ive made some more improvements to this segment as well by the way the player list now has positions by every name as well so looking down that list salahs 65 owned hollands 61 so its very close but still barely enough for harand to drop out the team it might be the highest youve ever had a player on the list of a negative difference holland 61 owned among the experts but 69 overall fleen just 4 ahead of r as well so thats a very close one but hes in the team now if youre not familiar with how this segment works the experts team is the 10 plate team so its the 15 most owned players among the hundreds of managers that get involved in this series keeping it within budget if money was no object then harlem would be in over himz due to ownership but thats not happening this teams got about 3 mil on the bank as well which goes to show how much the money spreads around if you dont have harland therefore its sal captain this week and salan vice pedro porro and v are the two other players with negative difference in the list here so in essence the overall player base likes them more than the experts do same for holland hopefully like the new changes this week it takes more time to do but i think the data is more digestible this way and easier to use so thats going to be on every video moving forward make sure youre subscribed so final segment heres the experts final thoughts and tips for game 11 this is what they had to say this week andrew ne sold trent and e for vandenberg and salah and he says ive taken my first hit of the season and brought salah in to protect my rank ive opted to go light at the back to accommodate salah harand and palmer morton gams edison says i think the big question this week is whether man city are going through a blip were january going to have a bad season i think the international breaks coming up at the perfect time for pep he gives him a while to get key assets back from injury and working on stopping the rot conquer boners says ill be hitting the wilder button in gamei 12 so ive gone for two upside transfers in this week k and pedro por in for watkins and celba as for captain this week hes currently on salah but im tempted by big dom salanki home to ipswitch he cant haul two weeks in a row can he jason flem says whilst harlands underlined data remains among the strongest in the league city look absolutely shock for confidence at the minute and salah palmer and saka all look much more appealing captain the options in the coming weeks harem may very well come good against brighton this week but releasing the funds allow this ideal thre him in midfield as well as my preferred team structure going forward matt brooks makes a valid point on selling harland considering moving harland on but the challenge will be once hes gone its going to be very difficult to get him back at least until the second wild card so it will be a big call fpl tony the man city leaker himself is keeping harland and hes captaining him as well as a sal nonowner so thats a bit reassuring and he says and my free transfer mini wild card coming after the international break and lastly hey fpl says errow 404 robot
