hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel for another elite 11 team reveal ahead of game week 11 guys weve got mark back on the channel were going to preview game week 11 weve got phil foden versus bruno fernandez comparison and were going to take a look at all of the statistics as we approach game we 11 so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel and mark welcome back mate its been a minute hasnt it so how have you been getting on hows the season been progressing mate hello tom good to be back its been a long time i think the last time i was here i was doing quite a bit better than i am now ive had probably 75 red arrows recently ouch you can see it on the graph there i was i started out quite well and held that up till about the wild card then like many people a disastrous wild card and then just flat few weeks not getting what we call a rob of the green and find it hard to make headway but at the same time i havent had a complete rank collapse and i think the gaps tight between a million 500000 are pretty tight as well see when we come to my team i was i was down at 17m on saturday night and then just by virtue of salanki and rogers doing quite well came back 700000 wow so while saturday night might have been a time to panic for me i dont think its time to panic now and i think for people in general one outlier a good week where you get in the top half million game week rank you can make progress nice thoughts mate and i can i can see the red arrows there that youve mentioned but like you say its still so tight isnt it for that for that range between half a million through a million so nothing no reason to panic just yet you and i were talking off camera just before recording mark as well around decisions that people have made and then being eminently sensible and the rub of the green do you think thats just a reflection of this season being a little bit more difficult than in previous seasons weve talked around the price points being good this season and people are making good decisions right its just not necessarily gone our way so far right what i found in the last few weeks is like ive made some hard decisions in terms of 5050 calls were they the right thing to do and looking back some of them might have been the wisest but i havent got busted in terms of points my transfers im working out even are a little bit up in terms of points okay but my rank is just falling because of just conditions and i dont think theres anything too exceptional about this i think people trying retrofit of story the pricing is very competitive its because weve got these great premiums but i dont think in a general sense theres anything that unusual going on here when you have a good start maybe you get a little bit conservative and then you drop back because other people are being more assertive and then every reaction is an opposite reaction so when i when i had gone pretty low in rank on saturday night that evening i was thinking what do i need to do here and i started thinking in a more aggressive fashion what moves would i make next week maybe i try and grab back some of the points i lost on salah by continuing to avoid him so i went through this less than 24hour period where i started to think differently and you realize theres other ways to get points and by virtue the fact that i started doing badly maybe im going to change what i do and maybe ill get a boost out of that i see so i dont think theres that too unusual going on this season and beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so is good and bad luck so im hoping itll come back to me ill probably due to where my rank is maybe ill take a little bit more risk on things maybe make a few transfers that are a little bit more risky its the game is always the same you live and die by the little bit of luck you get you do good thoughts and its interesting isnt it though the difference that one or two games can make on that second day of the of the of the game week and you wont be alone in that with sanki as you mentioned and rogers of course so thats a nice little segue mark lets take a very quick look and see how you performed in game week 10 okay so we can see here its its a team that weve already alluded to a couple of players that came through and saved the game week with rogers and tanki lets start with those two mark ive got a couple of questions we are going to look ahead to your gw 11 team in just a just a few moments but what you read on ter on terms of aston villa here rogers picking up a nice nine points here theyve got this away match at liverpool in gw 11 got beaten in the champions league as well and theres been some noise around them looking a little bit jaded off the back of the tougher schedule do you think this is a time to start moving away from aston villa with rogers being an exception what do you think about aston villa at large from in an fpl context i dont think theyve been very impressive all season to be honest okay theyve been like i dont know how to describe it a little bit stodgy i think theyve lost a lot with douglas lise watkins got some points but nothing too spectacular and as you say you dont move away from rogers theres no good reason to at his value but they dont look too impressive like in my last man standing at work i was quite happy to back spurs at the weekend and watching that game as funny i hear different people read this game differently but i felt it was very unjustified that villa went in up at halftime okay it was the usual spurs story that weve seen a few times it started with lester at the start of the season they had all the possession they had all the field tilt but they just werent making the chances and then in the second half once they did maybe once rogers went off spurs made spurs werent afraid to change things a little bit and they started making chances and they won quite easily it wasnt a 41 game but i think it was deserved at spurs won and i wasnt too surprised okay so there maybe i think its too simple to say like its the wednesday saturday wednesday no i think they lost they lost some important players maybe diabi was worth a little bit more to them than they thought douglas lise he was doing a lot in there interesting the reason for asking the question is i know ole watkins will be in some of the viewers teams and certainly id id imagine that would be a chance to be looking elsewhere and weve got some well do the stats round up later on guys and well look at attackers and we do we will be talking around mo salah of course in the in the earling harland quandry as well lets take a look at the rest of the team though mark weve got this treble man city compliment here with rico lewis phil foden and earling harland there three losses on the spin on the guardiola feels like thats the first time i could have said that whilst doing this videos what do you think about man city as an fpl option here lets lets take it in the three assets that you got right now should we be panicking is this just a blip whats going on with man city it doesnt look good to be honest the howland thing is i think howlands fine to own you talk about money and budget and all that and thats where the problem is with howland but howland as a player as a place in your team as someone who can perform week in week out its not a problem and people would say hes not scoring but dominic sanki wasnt score until sunday so that can turn around in a flash so im happy enough to have howland theres things you can do with the money if you dont have them thats discussion then foron is hes been slightly painful to own people who got on him would have got on him for a fixture run wolves then who was it southampton and then bourett and i think his underlying stats have been reasonable youd expect him to have more points so its been quite painful and he scored in two european games around in this in this period of time of course he has so the issue i have with foding at the moment outside of citys form is people tend to now look at xgi a lot and theyre going to think hes doing quite well but the assist component of xgi for me isnt its not a fantastic metric in my opinion because like theres a second degree and thats the other player has to convert the chance so im not im not entirely sure its right to equate one xgi of g with one xgi of a if what and thats mostly what fens is and that worries me about him and then lewis is just about a sell for me i think i i think we all we believe the hype didnt we and our worst fears come to pass and they are a that walker eats some of his minutes and thats happening and we thought it would and thats fine but then like the defensive fora city is theyre wide open theyre wide open down the right hand side definitely so hes hes i think i bought him at 46 hes 48 now i can sell him for 47 when you look around you got people like lewis hall maybe anderson a fulham its a bit its a bit too much to have a player whos in a defense thats not doing anything and as its transpired hes not that great an attacking threat he might get these halfast sideways pass 30 yards out assists but hes not creating chances in the conventional sense i see so im im not too concerned about howland im very concerned about lewis and fen just feels like you can do a little bit more with the money but he could explode any day he could and like i say we do have a comparison between phil foden and bruno fernandez to come later on in our slides as well guys so stick around for that i think that will probably wrap up my observations from your gw 10 team mark just a quick final thought on the the rico lewis money there one of the stats were going to look at later on is of course expected goals conceded team metric and little spoiler forest are top of that in terms of how well theyre performing been amazing havent they mar they i think you called it that they ended the season last season impressively defensively thats continued into this season as well any thought that you could be looking to the nottingham forest defensive line to complement your defensive players this ones a bit painful because like first of all to answer your question i think is a little bit late in the day okay and maybe we can come back to it in a few weeks but i think theyve got some fixtures now that indicate maybe they want keep as many clean sheets with the cavat yet that they kept clean sheet at anfield yes of course and a few weeks ago i had i was making some moves and i got pedro parro in and i my gut was to go with minkovich and i didnt and id say i havent counted it up but theres a pretty big difference there at this point sorry for asking mate okay but you me tom you get a sub story about every question theres always a sub story in the background that im only willing to tell thats why we have you on man we need to we need to offer you that all right well lets see if we can continue that sub story theme when we take a look at how your team is shaping up ahead of game week 11 and a transfer has already been made so lets take a look okay so its cool this week were recording later in the week were recording midweek and a transfer has already been made we can see kuna already coming into the team here and i want to talk around that then mark theyre sitting bottom of the league wolves they have had a wretched run of fixtures havent they a rotten start to the league in terms of the difficulty of fixtures we still believe though in this team and in coo ahead of finally a favorable run of fixtures how do you how do you assess them as a collective and then we talk around co as an fpl option as well this team this week isnt a sb story my team looks nice this week im absolutely getting the green arrow theres no doubt about that anuna like hes half the story the other half of the story is dominic alveron and before this game week started one of the things i was considering last week was salanki to coa so its good i didnt do that because i wanted to do i would preferred to get calbert leen out and coo was my preferred option so i did that saturday evening and i was going to do that once he came through the palace game fit so half the story is calvert leen then the reason ive gone for ca is hes got good fixtures hes very good i think hes like a level above practically the majority of that wolves team theyve got some guys in the middle who are very good who arent so famous and theyre not fantasy options but i think hes he is legitimately their best player and talisman so im quite happy to take that for the next few fixtures there were alternatives there chris wood wia r and i just think this is the guy who can do the big hall hes got hattrick potential hasnt he mark weve seen it previously as well he does have that monster hall in his locker doesnt he thats a statement of fact weve seen those returns historically havent we so can definitely see you there as well noticed here weve still got a free transfer mark as well so presumably you had the two frees any plans to use the second one as part of this game you could you happy with how youre set up like you said youve got a guaranteed green arrow already so its nice to know that but any other ways that you could invest that other transfer i think look looking to the future the things i can imagine im going to need are im going to need to have a little bit more depth in my defense and as i mentioned lewis is a bit of a waser and greaves is a total waster so i could use my i think ive got three no point4 as youve written there i could use that there i could also roll looking to the future but im not in a mood to wait around and i need to i need to make moves in rank now and the best way i think i can do that is to move phil forward perhaps to bruno fernandez and well do that well take a look at stats in a in a moment to see whether or not thats that is peing your interest enough lets just talk quickly around the captaincy that i see the armband on dominic salanki here mark thats exciting talk to us around the virtues for dom in the home game against lip swit rather than earling harland away at away at brighton i like to switch my captaincy around at the start of the week to provide value for the fantasy football fix elite 11 reveal subscribers to give them something to think about so im thinking about you dear viewers in this case i think like there are a lot of options for people this week if i have bruno in there im very tempted i think k is not a bad pick i think salanki is not a bad pick and i think howland is always a good pick ill probably end up on i think just in the hope of people got a jump on me last week who went to salah and captain them but they the main dont have allen still so i hope to pull some of that back and i think hes hes got top expected points i expect but i if i see any and captain in sanki if i see anyone captaining bruno fernandez i think good for them i wouldnt say not to do it mate thats thats cool just a word on cole palmer as well we had it confirmed today that he hasnt yet trained we were recording on wednesday night there still chelsea is still hopeful that hell make the arsenal fixture on the weekend lets just do a bit of a hypothetical mark if he were to be ruled out of that game week any temptation to look elsewhere with that premium option there or would you be holding him for longer than game week 11 no i think what i do is id probably use the money i saved from foden on bruno to maybe take greaves or lewis somewhere and play them instead id probably put in mikeno i so i wouldnt sell bmer i took a hit to get him in a few weeks ago as that was just im going to do this at some stage so i might as well do it but on on the fact he hasnt trained on tuesday if he got a kick on the knee bone on sunday i wouldnt have hes not playing on thursday i wouldnt have expected him to drink yesterday it didnt sound too serious does it and theyre going to be absolutely reliant on him arent they so nothing to worry about there im sure all right cool well look guaranteed green arrow thats nice so well see whether or not we can get you back on soon to see whether or not or just the extent of that green arrow mark but all looks good all right weve been talking around this phil foden bruno fernandez comparison so lets take a look at what the fanasy footballfixcom statistics suggest in terms of that comparison okay mark so phil fodens coming to the team hes in my team as well im sure hes going to be in one or two of the guys watching in terms of their teams as well weve got some stats up here for the season to date so far in terms of per 90 minute statistics you can see an awful lot of green on the right hand side here for bruno fernandez and weve got our attacking radar which is one of the features that you can go and take a look at on fantasy footballfixcom if you havent already done so lets talk around this then mark youre looking at phil fod 93m bruno fernandez over a million cheaper talk me through it mate im an owner i need to understand whether or not i need to ditch this giza so i started out the week a little bit worried maybe about fodens minutes and that didnt get any better when he started yesterday but he scored and the nature of the goal he scored was the goal that will endear him to guardiola he pressed he won the ball himself and he smashed in so i can imagine this is the player that guardiola wants in the team right now he seems to be one of the few players in that team whos performing to a somewhat reasonable level so im less concerned about his start but ill still be worried at four oclock on saturday and i think theres a good argument for holding him but the argument on the other side is that bruno has three significantly easier fixtures hes got penalties and he again is a talisman for united at the moment now the reason i ended up on foden is because i tried to take a play on fixtures that didnt work out so surely if i do this again justice will reign and bruno will come in big time im not here to make any guar gu anes but i guarantee it so that could be interesting youre man united fan right mark theyve got a new manager coming in thats look super exciting im looking forward to seeing how hes going to adapt to the league and see what he can do with this crop of players hes not in situ yet theyve looked terrible to me for so long are we expecting that theyre going to rud rro is going to get a tune out of them prior to the new manager coming in they have looked terrible youre right and they havent scored many goals i think theyre 17th 18th maybe on xg across the season but theyre sorry theyre 18th on goal scored but theyre sixth on xg okay and i think when you got strikers like highland and xery you go a long way towards explaining why that is and what youre looking at with bruno is hes taking the set pieces hes taking penalties as we know hes taking corners and youre just against these bad defenses and you hope he can hit that 12 13 14 pointer once and maybe twice i see and i think looking at the fixtures its a three fixture play and then hes gone maybe the sacka like that so i think ill do it i think ill end up doing it and another thing there is it goes back to what i was mentioning about fen being a little bit more assisted you can see here theyre getting equal numbers of shots but its not written there but the the xg per shot its implied by the other figures that maybe brunos getting a better quality of shot his expected goals is markedly less isnt it and were going to look at stats in a moment mark in fact lets just move on and take a look at that cuz the one of the metrics that we look at there is attempted assists as well i think it is from a creativity perspective and i think thats going to make your point as well but i do understand the case that youre making for bruno fernandez and look its a million isnt it give or take which is not an insignificant amount chunk of change to consider as to what that could do with your squad separately but lets take a look at the rest of rest of the stats mark to see whether or not that completes the picture here okay guys so you should be getting familiar with this set of or suite of stats that were looking at just a reminder this is the last four game we stats per 90 minutes and players must have played at least 180 minutes to qualify and if you look at the attempted assist mark you can see fodens name is in their fourth joint top in fact but is in that set but you dont see him elsewhere in here right so is that making your point it creativity looks okay but the other avenue to points youre not seeing his name up in lights and you need him to at that price he feels like at the moment youre looking at maybe seven eight points at best but like this is all very iffy stuff he you get one return in the first half theres no trouble getting a second return and then its a hall so i think its a very risky move to go from foron to bruno but the fixtures are significantly different theres like its a big difference in those fixtures you could look at cities next three brighton spurs and liverpool and like maybe you wouldnt be surprised if they have one win one draw one loss over those three sure and then whats whats the cap on what fodens going to get there whereas united optimistically playing two the promoted teams playing everton who can be resolute but they can be shocking as well you just hope maybe he gets two double figure halls there and it all pays itself off no i like its creative thought before we take your assessment on some of these other players in the in the stats there do you think youll do it ahead of gw 11 do you think when we come to game week 11 starting do you think bruno fernandez is going to be in your team i think so id be like 60 to 70 sure at this point ill do it just feel like i need to do something it would be very disappointing to sit on fen he does nothing and then bruno fires a few in whereas i think i would regret less taking the gamble and it gone wrong than not taken it and gone wrong and i think this is youve seen where my rank is so no i have i have and despite what we said about how tight it is between to the half a million a million i get it at some point there needs to be a decision made doesnt there of course man do play tomorrow night so hopefully this conversation isnt rendered completely redundant and bruno fernandez doesnt pick up any knock or that rules him up i wouldnt mind though that would that would make mind up right so here are the other statistics then guys i always like talking about the expected goals conceded first this team metric that highlights strong performing defenses we talked a little bit around forest already mark any of the other ones leeping out of you i think you mentioned leis hall didnt you earlier on in the in the video as well do you think these teams are starting to make a case for defensive assets for folks watching to consider as part of their transfers moving forward i know fulham have been in there for several game weeks already anyone else leaping out of you as a potential team to target from a defensive perspective i dont think anyones standing out from the point of view of theyre defending so well that we should have them forest yes but i think that as i said i think that time is slightly passed the names i mentioned were more in terms of value of the players themselves maybe theyre a good option because if there arent many clean sheets going doesnt matter too much who you pick i think people id be looking towards are those i mentioned hall maybe anderson i think cantic could be a good pick id be looking towards cwell maybe shortly okay nice and maybe just try and get on a few you fix your swings and hope you get the value when you pick up a clean sheet or an attacking return along the way but i dont think you can say with the exception of liverpool that any defense truly knows that it looks like what its doing and far but we mentioned fair enough mate fair enough look earning harlands been a topic of discussion in fpl circles for a little while now with how just how much money cost and lack of returns man citys form having lost three games on the spin examp for except still top of the xg hes top of the shots in the box hes top of shots overall on this for this period mark which side of the fence are you coming down on in terms of retaining highland or using that highland money to access moala bearing in mind he still features in the expected fpl point stats that we can see there 77 over the last four whats your read mate like if you look back at what hes done certainly against southampton and b tournament and people say hes missed big chances and he has but like i think anyone whos played football even fide knows that feeling when the ball comes across to you and you just cant twist to get it in or you just cant get the header at the angle i think thats what it looks like it doesnt look like hes missing oneon ones where hes just had a melt down and he couldnt make a decision its like hes trying to physically get it in but just you can and i think we all know that feeling and hes just had a series of those that could as easily have gone in as not so im not too worried about it and in light of what sanki did on sunday we shouldnt be too worried about it the concern is youre theres the opportunity cost and then on the salah side and i realize i am probably the only person in the world who hasnt been impressed by salah this season and dont even bother putting it in the comments i know im wrong but i watched the games and hes not too involved or hes not i dont think hes doing the things he did before in terms of just torching defenders and things like that but then he just has this amazing moment of quality with an assist or the goal on saturday and just i feel hes getting the other side of what howand isnt okay interesting man interesting and thats a risky game to play and i think one of the flaws that fpl players traditionally have is they flipflop and thats why i think captaining holland again this week is probably the best play you captained them you captained them then you flipflop for no good reason and you miss the hall and youre like look how unlucky i am but its just no you just youre making inconsistent decisions here if hes your captain hes your captain i like it well ive just thought of something we didnt talk around this off camera but at all in fact its a complete ball for you but previously we were talking around foden to bruno fernandez there gar natos name appears here a couple of times in terms of the shot volume markedly cheaper any temptation to completely restructure things and go down to gara or are you thinking you need the assurity of minutes and the penalties for that to be a viable move and garnacho isnt a viable option i think one of the big things thats in brunos favor is we believe hes a lock for a start in 90 minutes and theres one instance at the towards the end of the chelsea game where garnacha was careless and he got number one bailed out and then ball out by casimero and i dont know its the thing you see and you think well a manager might give him a boot up the ass and put him on the bench the next game see and i just i dont know because weve seen seen rashford on both sides seen him on the right against chelsea which is rare enough under 10 hag i just feel like maybe things are pretty fluid between dio rashford and garnacho and just i dont think hes sure enough of his start it could be wrong but no its bruno all day for me fair enough mate fair enough in terms of these other players here weve got cole palmer that weve talked around as well dam scs names been up in lights for the last two videos that ive looked at here and alexander isach as well starting to appear in these charts as well weve not mentioned him throughout the course of the video but scored a great goal what a cool goal that was against arsenal what a throwback to being able to cross the ball and header it i loved it as someone who grew up watching football in the 90s do you think theres anything in eak as an fpl option mark right now as part of a front three or do you think hes hes slightly too much money what do you think about newcastle attacking assets with specifically around isach i think the time for we went through a little spell there where everyones talking about a pool of strikers k ca wi a ro these i think the focus now around 12 is going to shift to maybe isac jackson back to hs and people are going to be a little bit antsy that they dont have that extra little bit of money in the bank so they present a nice alternative to howland that i wasnt convinced that replacing howland with one of these lower budget players was great but i think when youve got an option in 12 like jackson or isac its very attractive to then go to salah elsewhere see i i think and salanki has saved himself quite a bit of selling as well so i think we can see forward lines pretty soon who are jackson sanki isak type things love it love having all these great options and many different types of teams that are going to be being seen all over all over the game like i personally enjoy that i think what people should not forget is that yes alland and salah will score the halls more often but other players will get halls less often and its not theres theres a lot of ways to go theres a lot of options you can take and if youre a person who spends a lot of time complaining about template moves and people copying content creators or whatever you can definitely be brave and find your own way here and youll do well if youre lucky exactly and hopefully some of the viewers get that because its a great feeling when it does when it does land definitely mark been a pleasure mate great to catch up weve just gone over a half hour so we should probably wrap things up but is there anything that we havent covered that you wanted to wanted to mention before we call it quits no i dont i dont think so i think this is a good week for maybe taking a hit or two theres some pretty tasty fixtures on so if you need to make a longterm fix to your team might be a good week to try it like it good way to finish mate well enjoy the guaranteed green arrow and thanks so much for coming back
