welcome back for another video gamei 3 is just finished so lets recap some things weve learned this week to take into gamei 4 after the international break of course and ill discuss my transfer plans at the end as well ive got two free transfers now and some big decisions to make in terms of how to spend them so arsenal drew one o of brighton to kick the gamei off somewhat of an upset with arsenal heavy favorites to win this one and a controversial red card if you saw the clip of what happened was it a second yellow or not ry poked the ball away as velman was getting ready to take the free kick which resulted in a second yellow his first red card of his career and as a result hes going to miss the north london derby in game four hav scor arsenals goal which was a sacker assist and they both got some bonus between them so thats 11 goals and nine assists in habit last 17 games for arsenal so 117 returns per game over that run the red card not great though ry is going to be a huge miss next match i do wonder if artetta might use havocs in midfield for one game with trad possibly playing up top but we could see geor come straight in for rice mourinho still out injured for a while jaia pedro got brightons goal thats two goals in his last two now the budget forwards welbeck would xia pedro duran cal etc theyve all been putting isak and watkins to shame so far harer not so much jaia pedr summon im almost certainly going to buy for gami 4 given that they face ip switch home and then forest home is the next to for buan returned from injury and he was straight back in between the sticks and hes an option as well if he need to keeper as is dun if you need a defender dunk was actually at fa for the goal as sacka leapt for an aerial jw and he caught him by surprise nonetheless he will be nailed met and m menacing as well both solid transfers to gamei four aston villea bit less to 21 thanks to goals from man and jan watkins got an assist nothing to rogers so thats 61 64 and 60 minutes for watkins in the opening three which is concerning and further to that jans form plus the champions league kicking off soon emry had remarked on a minor watkins injures so that could be partly why but also durans form now biley went off injured after 50 minutes thats really unlucky if he went for him anana also got a minor injury and he came off for barkley second half despite the two goals and three its not sustainable for anana and i personally dont see him as a viable asset long term 5 mil bon not got leicesters goal which puts him on one goal one assist in his last two though he didnt start he came off the bench and then got his goal not a single clean sheet across all seven games on saturday so dont feel hard d by if you didnt keep one no one did brenford beat southampton 31 almost a clean if not for a 95th minute consolation goal armstrong and played 45 minutes for the saints and boom lift up to the promise he got brace and he was something that we did talk about in the players to bu video thats now 25 returns in 26 games when playing without tony who of course has left brenford now really gamei 3 was the time to buy him and then its probably gamei five or six since they do have man city your way next well played if you did go for him though outside of his brace he also created two big chances im expecting him to be hugely popular in a few weeks time v for one mil cheaper also a very solid option hes got two goals and an assist from the opening three game weeks 134 expected goal involvement against southampton which only harand could beat this week and no one took more than vs six shots southampton conceded 278 expected goals only west ham fed worst against man city so as we suspected southampton could be a team to target and theyre up against man united next after the break all the data mentioned here is from my scout tables link below to become a member and take advantage of all the premium fpl tools available there everton looked on track for their first points of the season they were 20 up in the 87th minute against bourma which is the latest of teams ever been tun a up in premier league history to go on to lose total collapse cal l got a goal and an assist c st had a massive impact to goal and assist himself off the bench the one bom of play whos leaping out for me is seeno hes got returns in all three games so far hes an absolute menace hes passing the ey test and hes heavily involved in their attack and obviously following the departure of salanki is bound to be more involved especially while evan nielson settles him only 5 and 1 half mil they do have a mixed bag of pictures though theyve got chelsea and their liverpool before facing south and leicester and then its three tougher games against arsenal villa and man city and then a great run of fixures again looks a great pickup nonetheless though hes a cheap punt gamei six might be the time to buy him obviously if youre on a wild card or if youre able to rotate him off your bench with others on your team then that works as well so lets talk about harand then 31 win backtoback hatt tricks that makes him the first player to score a hattick in two of the first three games since the 1994 95 season 20 years ago seven goals in three is just absurd now and hes lived up to the 15 mil price tag early on a painful one if you didnt have him but obviously salah did well as well fpl is a very unforgiving game and it can have huge wings at times gami one salah owners w gamei 2 harland owners w gamei three it was even they both got 17 points obviously if you have both then youre laughing at this point the big question for a lot of teams is it worth taking salah out for him and then even more difficult so is it worth making those two moves for minus 4 hereit liverpools next three a forest home bourn with home then walls away man citys fixes a brenford home arsenal home newcastle way so theres no denying liverpool win in terms of fixtures so i do think that they will score very similarly in the next three and if you are fed up with not owning the most end player in the game in such an insane form then just do it but it is easier to make the case for sakura to fund harland if you can afford it something sak tooma and isak to harand for example one things for certain harlands not going to continue with his current output hed be on for an 80 goal season otherwise so its just not going to happen a perfectly sound way to play fpl is just to cover all those highly owned assets harland and palmer so basically to minimize your exposure to rank swings ive seen plenty of wild card teams this week without harland so those that are free to pick whoever they want still arent necessarily going for him with a view to buying harland game week seven instead one other thing to note aside from harland is viio has not been playing the advanced positions of last season lewis has been the more advanced one 18 touches in the box for lewis this season seven for viio an assist from lewis as well and he got bonus point for one of harlands three goals ill be doing a wild card video this week coming so make sure you subscribe to see the team chelsea drew one of crystal par palace from a jackson goal and a scoring palaces patience rewarded for those that kept hold of a despite the price drop it was a recurring theme on last weeks video that the likes of e and isach need a bit more patience and it did deliver was a lovely curled shot from outside the box for e du assist palmer assisted jacksons goal and despite yellow card for booting the ball away still got two bonus points as they got all three for a 10pointer thats 45 returns in 50 games for palman now newcastle beat spurs 21 vanen missed out on this one kagu said he was close in training this week but hes not quite 100 fair isak finally coming good as we said he got a goal squared by murphy for a taing and he also hit the bar early in the game por had an assist for romero goal rolled slightly offside he actually took six shots which was more than anyone that game outrageous positioning at times on porro he joins the front line in attack and hes going to come up with a few double digit holes this season no doubt clean sheets were basically a myth this game week the only team that actually managed to keep one was liverpool ending the game with a 30 dominant win over man united huge relief for salah captain is who got a goal and two assists meaning he actually finished on the same score as harand both getting 17 points diaz scored a brace as well liverpool looks so good at the moment thats three wins on the bounds and theys still yet to concede even including this time at fenard slot is still yet to lose a game this calendar year 127 points and sals 14 appearances against man united over his career he always shows up against them treny came off early again for bradley locking in his clean sheet no returns for jota this week so lets finish up with my team and transfer plans for gaming four is henderson trent coner dunk roger sacka e smith row fernandez isak and harland team looks in good shape this week got two free transfers as well 15 mil on the bank theres two options im considering option one is to use that 1 and a half mil to move canon to xiao pedro which does improve my depth and id have to bench smith row against west ham game four i this option cuz it only requires one move and it might allow me to save the wild card cuz in gamei 6 i want to bring in a couple of arsenal players maybe in buo as well how however that of course means i have to go no salah whos home to forest and then home to bournemouth and then theyve got ws and palace away so the other option im considering is isak to xiao pedro and bruno to salah now this gets me three premiums which i really but its not about tradeoffs first of all id be selling bruno before southampton despite how disappointing hes been its a great fixture id also be using two three transfers here and its probably a transfer i have to make in the middle of the international break rather than after it because ive currently got 02 mil wiggle room at the moment but jia pedro looks hes rising tonight and eak could fall despite his goal so im not sure if its a risk i really want to take on cuz id have to make those two moves during the week and if someone at own gets injured for example then id have to play por against arsenal or wild card even there is the option to wait and still buy seller but it wouldnt mean losing sacka i fanc sack to do well against spurs so i dont really want to get rid of him and that leaves me with no arsenal players as well and as i say i want to have three and game six ideally so its difficult to get back to three players by selling now id probably have to sell salah to get sacka back in as i definitely not selling harand to fund it so as it stands im currently leaning towards canon to xiao pedro and take two pr transfers into gami 5 let us know in the comments how youve gotten this week and what your plans are for gamei 4 thanks very much for watching as always see you soon for the next one
