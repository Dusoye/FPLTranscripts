good evening everyone welcome to fpl blackbox ahead of gw nine take two how are you mr andy mode you right im not too bad mate is it is still lagging or are we all right no were good i think thats it i tried quite an optimistic setting the resolution to 4k and i think that might be the reason why things were as great as they were but hello to everyone im sorry that mr mark sus isnt here but its great to see you and if youre your first black boox of the season isnt it is indeed its the first black box of the season ive missed its been a while i dont know the last time i was on i know my favorite one was when we were roasting your wild car but i think that was a little while back now that was a friday night mid midseason wasnt it wasnt it the exact before christmas probably burned into my into my mind luckily my season started a little bit better this time so its not quite as as bad has it been have you found the season so far you been enjoying it its not been too bad ive ive had a little bit of a struggle so far this season usually im a little bit higher than this but its been ive made a few moves a little too early and that sometimes hurt me and i seem to have avoided the liverpool midfielder points i ive owned three of them and seem to have owned them all at the wrong times but its its picking up a little bit now got a green arrow this week so hopefully that can carry on and the teams looking all right so fingers crossed its i think this is the first time ive streamed with you for a while where youve been ahead of me which doesnt feel very nice it was heading in the direction of it was going to be my highest rank for about 18 months but red this week after so many so like so many people it was a it was a it was a strange game week and weve weve got quite a lot to talk about we only have you for about 45 minutes because then youve got a yes a delivery coming which is a supermarket of choice thats thats the key question is i love to say like id love to

be for you exactly anyway check it out manc cuk and use our code blackbox for 20 off before we get into game weeks and all of that stuff i think we have to cover the big talking point of the week and i know youve briefly spoken about it already on the scow cast but it is this whole sack content creator cartel theres already comments about the cartel in the chat that im im seeing whats your take on sacka gate there was a lot of last minute moves from sacka to son to foden from popular people within the community do you think there was anything untoward going on no we certainly didnt get any bloody news did we no i know and i said this to you before we streamed is that if youre getting news and not telling me im not going to be very happy so im pretty sure there is nothing going on behind the scenes i think it was just a lot of good managers making a good move sacka was not 100 going to play and a lot of people wanted to move him on the next week anyway and i think thats just what they did they jumped on two assets that they thought could do quite well this week and had nice fixtures moving forward which was foden and son i kept sacka myself i moved havs out i kept sacka and keeping sacka meant i got minkovich off the bench so worked okay for me i know jamm a little bit but i didnt move sacar out because i knew i had minkovich first on the bench and i think those people that had a good bench or a good person that could in there was less of a risk as those players that maybe didnt i can i can see why they made the move i want to move sacker out this week it was always my plan and if i thought he was definitely going to be out or i thought i need to move him out to get another player in i see it as a good move personally so i do also think as well people keep forgetting that these managers could have like two three four transfers in the bank at the moment so like moving a player out like that theres less risk i feel doing it when youve got lots of transfers so i dont think theres anything going on personally and if it is im not privy to it so id be very surprised you ob but theres theres nothing going on is there as my god im getting im getting called out as part of one of the people that sold him with 20 minutes of the headline and i what happened to me i got by bloody boers tweet when he was impersonating that arsenal and who sent you that list ah and in the godfathers chat bloody mark southerns shares it and hes been caught out before like that and i clicked on it and my normal check is just go over i was thinking of selling him anyway so i was looking for any excuse i click on the link he sends i check the subscriber numbers 20k i look through the previous tweets and they all look legit and thats what boa did smartly if you could call it that this time is that he created a bit of a pre loop because normally its just inject emojis and youre like okay clearly thats thats bua this time he done the ground workor and it just it completely got me so i looked at that transferred sacker out went back to the group chat and someone said thats thats boer mark and it was it was too late and thats normally the thing that catches you out and then sacka didnt play foden was benched he came off and got the assist it was a real roller coaster andy im not going to lie but ultimately it was the right decision because i had dibling for a sub but it surprised me how many people had forgotten who bua was because hasnt done anything for a little while and then all of a sudden i had people in chats going whos whos bua whos this bua why do you all know that this is fake and as soon as there was an extra letter in the charles wats thing i was like i know this is fake but the fact you did the sacka move because of it i thought i was absolutely brilliant and the fact mark sent it to you as well but you brought foden in so it didnt turn out that badly did it no and the two players that people were bringing in were son and foden and both of them got some points for the owners and i think thats what sha a bit more of a lens on it because had they both blanks i dont think people will care i just think i can i thought all week saaka would play and it was only when i saw the team arriving at the stadium and he wasnt in any of the pictures and then we had the old andy martin thing of him going to the stadium and hes all of that was just was just brilliant i was probably going to sell him this week anyway and because it was like 5050 at that point i just thought what im gonna do it a week early and bring him in and sk says getting buono in is a good cover story i love that as if id make that up to make myself look like that much of an idiot what i love someone else in the chat has put we know you two arent getting leaks because look at your ranks its like if we were getting leaks you think id be 17m at the moment ive told this story before i told it to you earlier but the only the only leak ive ever had genuinely was last season someone messaged me i spoke to a fair bit on twitter and said just heard liento playing like today and he was in my team and i had him benched and i was like do what im gonna im gonna risk it im gonna play him off the back of that benched was complete rubbish its the only leak ive ive ever had its it is a funny one what i did this poll and i just thought theres a lot of like pe theres a lot of people like trigger lips has done videos on it and als done videos on it and theres lots of people calling into question like the integrity of content creators and i just thought out of the general twitter lot so this is a sample of like 2800 people if there was this secret whatsapp group this cartel group that people think there is well some people think there is which gets team leaks youre allowed to be in it but youre not allowed to ever share them and if you ever share them youre booted out immediately how many people would join it 76 said they would join that league i love that so i know its people give it all the high mighty and i think that 24 at least half of those would still would do it i know and to be fair i said to you before the stream when you showed me these results the thing is there are some people out there that wouldnt join it because theyre already part of it so you got to take that into account as well but i if you offered somebody that opportunity of course they do it but i think as soon as youve got a certain amount of followers and i dont know how many it is specifically as soon as you got a certain amount of followers its seen as is wrong if you do get leaks and things like that but you look at the biggest guy out there which is lets talk fbl he gets the leaks and he shares them all every single one he gets his shares so i dont know what people want to be perfectly honest but i think its f i dont think there is anything going on that we dont know most of the time no i think its a shame with because andy gets a lot of the brunt of it because the biggest account and people say is he doing it for clout on his deadline streams andy doesnt build his deadline streams as being this is where youre going to get the leagues people turn up because he might get them and he has a list of people that he trust that sometimes they in those leagues before but he always shares them with people so i dont know why he why he gets some of the stick that he does in this regard dont know i think people just attack people that are theyve got a big following bas i think and its unfortunate but thats where you get the most interaction sometimes so people wouldnt be doing it if they were just shouting into the void they want to make sure people interact back with them and thats what they want half the time which thats what twitter is isnt it its not been the best place over the last week or so hopefully it starts to pick up a bit and we can start having some nice chats again but its its not being the best place anyway lets talk some fpl stuff just quickly cover my team this week it was a bit of a disaster 33 points im sure a lot of people can sympathize with that raya trent gabrielle lewis and davis all blanked in defense foden came in he got the assist from the corner in the 90th minute four points inom o to rogers came in last minute for dibling who id been saying i was going to play all week and then i just suddenly went why am i playing as southampton player lets just get rogers back in so rogers got the got the goal booked again though it always seems to get booked when he when he scores which is annoying harland with four watkins did well for me with eight and salanki has been disappointing with two and i benched moreno who got six on my bench he would have been quite a nice differential but a bit of a bit of a me game w best we just move on right lets just move on from this one we can move on to mr mark southerns team managed to have a o worse worst with he got 26 i think fleen was his i know rogers was his highest scorer but fleen was up there with four trent cba with minus three lewis with two gabrielle with one seeno rogers and bumo f and harand salanki so a pretty similar team to mine had celba with minus what did you make of the celba red card how do you think thats going to affect arsenal going forward i think it is i think on scoutcast the other day we did a little bit of an analysis on arsenal and it shows that they are already conceding more chances than they were most of last season and theyre not putting up as much xg i think the odard injury is a massive difference i think he is such a controller of the ball in their midfield and i think these have been a massive miss i do also think theyve played a lot of their games with 10 men which hasnt helped their xgc this season either and their disciplinary record is shocking compared to the rest of the season its compared to the rest of the teams i dont know whats happen like they wanted them to be tougher and theyre doing that by getting red cards all the time which isnt great for their assets and cbra celebra managers the people that went celebra and gabrielle or cra and rya and went for that double aral defense have been punished quite brutally to be perfectly honest and minus three from cba is that is brutal so i think i think it is going to i think hes only going to miss one game isnt he but i think arsenal double defense especially with their fixtures moving forward i think id be moving off one personally and when you got a player like say 8 nori or someone like that who could be good especially from next week onwards i think id probably make the move myself i it is a one match ban the commentators on the match definitely said it was a three match ban and i went back and listened to it again and they said three matches but its not violent play right so its just a one match thats how i thought it was just one game fine so hes back for newcastle and chelsea but misses the liverpool game so not ideal for mark hes already made a couple of transfers ill talk about those in a bit your team though absolutely flying 40 points coming up trumps mate it wasnt looking that good i i had i had rogers as well who didnt do too badly i was absolutely gutted salanki got nothing i was out i was out in town when it was happening i was every goal that went in i was thinking sans got to be involved and every time he wasnt involved so i was absolutely gutt about that but the big one was that those forest players on the monday night and having word who could have had a hattrick like he looked good again like he hit the post he had a few sitters that he missed and then milinkovic as well milinkovic who i got in on wild card and i was eyeing up some of these nice fixtures palace we were talking beforeand and we put cells in our strictly come captain in selections palace honestly that all they do is just pepper goalkeepers from outside the box and they cant finish to say their low so that any keeper against him it looks absolutely brilliant to play him and sals got an 11 pointer in the end so the people that were waiting on say a ss and a wood for monday night got help themselves to 18 points but they saved me massively so i was on about a 500k red arrow until monday night and then i ended up getting a green arrow of about 100k so i will take it can you remember the last time a monday night game delivered for people its been a while it has been a while it used to quite i swear the one that sticks in my mind im pretty sure hazard played against west h and got and got a brace or a hat trick wasnt it and he absolutely killed it on a monday night i remember that quite vividly but if thats the last one i remember then that says a lot thats about eight years ago wasnt it eight years normally its like youve got one or two players left on the monday night and you think right they can save my game week they can they can do something for me and then you watch the clean sheet get wiped out after like 10 minutes and then player gets subed at 65 and youre like get up my whole monday night for this but that was a good one for forest owners it went it went well are you playing linkovich this week against lisa im not hes first on my bench i think or second on my bench i cant remember now but hes not in my team currently okay ive got moreno so he is in my in my team at the moment this is the great and the good sheve been added to this after not usurping whats the word beating grayhead last year that was the punishment that he faced you coming into this im top of the three of us somehow 785k which puts me fourth which is pretty surprising just below pra one point behind prz seven points behind harry had an awful week again with 26 prz and harry both well praz harry and mark all with 26 pretty remarkable ben kellin though 54 points with his son captain thing is were looking at him as smashing it and hes only 300k like there are other people out there that are like already in the top 100k like hibo is around the 100k mark and i think its absolutely mad that hes i feel like hes played well recently ben but like i said hes only 300k i expected him to be way more than that and thats after a almost 350k green arrow so its been its been tough so far in this league i would say and i looked at my overall rank and thought god im going to be bottom half of this easily so to be top half i think it says a lot about the start of the season but we got to remember as well that its very rare that weve had triple captain be played quite as much as it has been so far thats been played a lot so maybe thats t a little bit to be taken into account because all those that played highland got 17 extra points so maybe thats skewing things a little bit but its been tough 300 kb in the top and most of us over one mil is not usual i think its been the relentless form of as well i think quite a few people didnt start with him at the beginning like myself few a lot of people sold him on wild cards in maybe gameing five or six and hes carried on doing well two double digit halles in his last couple of game weeks so if you had if you had sellah youve been youve been doing well bl says its the bad and the worse good name good name for this league i have to say seb is struggling hes hes down 48 48m not doing the scout cast riew this season and just seems to love banking those transfers thats what does it thats what does it see you leave the scout cast and it all goes to part no hes i think i saw his team value is like 995 as well like hes like you said hes kept hold of those transfers and i dont think its helped him yet but im hoping that he has a couple good weeks and he starts storming on up but hes only what just under 50 points behind me and thats three million rank so hell make that up hold i thought theres theres theres not much in it between a good rank a respectable rank and even a poor rank at this stage so dont panic dont panic too much lets take a look at some stats this is team data defense and liverpool are at the top of this they have we i think we all know that theyre the best defends given from what weve seen which is one of the major things that slots bought in in his brief tenure villa a second interestingly not a team that i trust particularly but 89 is good quite tough fixtures to come lets talk about man city though ive got lewis i every week they just seem to concede its frustrating i find with this team data defense stuff that like youve got liverpool there okay they seem like the the best defense at the moment but is it any other defense that you trust at the moment funly enough forest was one that a lot of us put a bit of put a bit of money into because that their data did look good and they got the cheap options lewis at least is cheap like were not paying for gardol like that although he turned into prime roberto carlos at the weekend but i do think forest i do think forest are good liverpools an interesting one for me still they do look good but their fixture run has been the best it could possibly be up until now so the fact that their fixtures are changing now if they start keeping clean sheets and having this good a daya against teams like arsenal villa city like then we can start taking them seriously but i theres not a lot i was thinking about this with goalkeepers theres not a lot of goalkeepers i fancy moving forward either but theres an awful lot of fixtures that are changing soon so if youve got those high upside defenders like anate nori like that ive already mentioned them anyway their fixtures change you dramatically moving forward brentfords are looking good moving forward brightons look good after a while like all of a sudden youre looking at a few different teams and its just based on fixtures but i think forest and liverpool look the two best defenses ive seen so far villas interesting though because i thought villa might struggle with their whole playing in europe this year but theyve killed it in europe and they seem to not be having too much of a hangover after the games either so fair play to them its arsenals the biggest one for me it has been a bit of a drop off but do you think a lot of that is because of the red cards or do you think something quite dramatic has changed this year well i think i think its it doesnt help does it when youve had three red cards in eight games its its going to skew the statistics a bit against leicester it was just two freak worldly goals from james justin not much you can do about that i wonder if and james made this point last week that maybe they do switch off a little bit against some of the teams they expect to beat because theyve got so much of the ball because theyre so in control if youre two it up maybe do just take your eye off the prize a little bit and i think we saw that in the first game against wolves should have scored in that match villa was a tough game next but again i think watkins miss an absolute sitter in that game so i dont think its its surprising that maybe they havent hit the heights that we thought given that start but at the same time no clean against leicester southampton and bournemouth i know is a concern especially when you go into the run that theyre going on to now with liverpool newcastle and then chelsea are you are you doubled up you doubled up on arsenal defense im not so i was going to and then we werent sure whether ry was going to play so i brought flein in and went with havitz got me two goals in two weeks i was quite happy with that and now ive moved on from hav to salanki so no i wasnt and i think those people that went for double arsenal defense it was the floor play it was the im expecting some clean sheets in this run which was a good decision but its like i said its been its been paid off in the in the worst way especially with the celba red card rounding it off for a lot of managers there so i do think weve got to look at the data were seeing at the moment and think that arsenal arent the elite defense we thought they were but liverpools the one thats most interesting to me in terms of maybe not a trent because hes expensive we got to try and get those premium mids but when youve got players like canate who look good and kellerer who could potentially be in goal until december with reports that are coming out like theyre not the worst players to potentially to invest in but i do want to see how they get on against an arsenal and a villa and a city in the next five im i am doubled up on arsenal ive got gabrielle bench this week because i cant bench re havent got a backup benching gabrielle is a is a risky move given the given his threat from set pieces but i do want if we are going to see people pivoting to a double liverpool defense because i know theres theres jotter theres diaz theres salah theres trent theres theres there are decent picks there but if youre not going for salah i can see why people arent going for one of josh oraz given the fact that they get benched and theres rotation around that js now got this little injury so i wonder if maybe its its trent canate and then you leave the third spot open for salah i wonder if were going to see people doing that when the pictures turn id be very surprised id be surprised if people went double liverpool id be surprised if people are even got one at the moment unless its trent and even then the majority of people i know that have trent are thinking of selling him because hes just that cash cow that you need to move to those premium mids so id be very surprised the fixtures i wouldnt say are there the brighton games not too bad but brighton can attack so im looking at those fixtures and thinking i dont think now is the time to be moving to it from 15 onwards theres theres a case for it but i would be very surprised i think people are going to be moving off defense quite quickly and theyre going to be pumping their money into midfield because thats where it all is and were going to get to a time from 12 onwards when were wanting sacka were wanting son were wanting fod palmer were wanting all that harland still potentially and i think i just dont see it personally i think were going back into the old days of make your defense as cheap as possible and pump everything into midfield and strikers which it did wouldnt it thats exactly what it used to be 45m defenders across the board so well see do have trent well thats what do you think trents going to be the sacrifice for this i think so i think its just too easy a sacrifice to make in terms of you free up like three million by moving down from him and i and i think thats the biggest thing that people are going to do and when youve got players like i said like eight nori or i dont know mikeno that you can down to and they got nice fixtures i think people will do it other end of the table the obvious ones i switch a bottom i think no surprises there southampton and then leicester all in and around two expected goals conceded every game clearly the teams to target chelsea down in 17th i knew their defense had been bad but it has been bad according to the stats its interesting that one the three at the bottom of the three youd expect and theyve got some weve got some players with nice fixtures against them this week in brenford and weve got man city as well chelse is an interesting one and i think a lot of people didnt go for sanchez because they thought he was going to lose his place but i dont hate the idea of sanchez because they do concede a little bit of xgc if that makes sense but i would love to see how much his whats that stat was it xg prevented isnt it xgc prevented for keepers id love to see where he is on that because he always looks hes got a cler in him but andy let me let me let me get that up for you right now there you go at this there you go it is xgp is there its its ones four so its not great well hes hes four for points per 90 one is one ranks about one of one of the lowest on show i think ray rayer and leno the two lowest and pford pi at 23 leno at 24 no its an interesting that the two liverpool boys being top if we find out allison is out for a little bit longer kellaher is going to be extremely popular but onan is always going to be up there because we can see so many chances as well but no i was interested to see where sanchez was on this but i dont think that its its tough with chelsea because the fixtures arent there for quite a while are they youd be looking to move in maybe 12 or 13 and again if youve got a keeper thats is doing fine youre not going to be moving for one are you no just to just to reiterate what this what this chart showing so expected goal prevented just indicates how i think i think its the best metric of how well a goalkeepers been performing this season you can see hanson is there at the top at 46 hes prevented nearly five goals with some of the saves that hes made pope there at 31 anana had a great start to the season 33 you wouldnt expect to see rea in the minus so hes hes let in more goals than he should have done give what we seen from the champions league when hes saving penalties and rebounds and all that thing its you wouldnt expect to see it reversed allison at 27 so theres been some keepers that have had strong starts the season very interesting though that fens bottom one well not bottom but hes bottom of this list and minus 170 but hes got more save points than anybody else this season hasnt he yep hes made 42 saves and next best is pope with no next best is hanson with 40 and then its pope with 35 so thats quite interesting but fens also got the fixtures coming up i switch bournemouth leicester at home and hes got two nice away fixtures youd be hoping for something in that run i would have thought yep lets look at some attacking data dont know if you like me i think i probably trust the attacking data more than i trust the defensive data especially when you see teams like city and villa at the top when what i see is teams that can play quite well against them apart from in the champions league theyre doing well spurs are a topic that were going to talk about bit more this episode ive got a table on some of their assets and they are top non 90 expect to score two goals a game with chelsea second 186 and man city just off that 185 but spurs players weve both got slanky how are you feeling about how are you feeling about that hes going to be in and around the attack the thing that is interesting at the moment and i was listening to the above average pod and they were saying the same thing is that he seems to be doing that firmino role like firmino used to do for liverpool where he does a lot of the work to make sure that the wingers get what they need to do and madison kisi brennan johnson son seem to be thriving because theyve got that striker up front and you think theyve had te o vera richison and people like that for a little while since kanes left and i think is what theyve needed theyve needed that player thats a bit selfless and will do that not great for fpl nobody ever picked forino he did have those weeks where he did well i think sank will still be fine but i think if youve got sank and hes your only attacking spurs asset i think you probably want to try and get another one especially for this little run that theyve got as well and the fact they in 11 and 13 theyve got two captain all fixtures my biggest thing is which one do you go for because i think if you were set me up so perfectly i know i know because look at this because son is the one that seems to be the explosive player that weve weve had an fpl before and hes the one that can hit those heights and get you the braces hat tricks whatever its going to be brennan johnson seems to be getting a ridiculous amount of chances inside the box and touches inside the box which it shows here but ive got such a soft spot for koseski like i think hes creating so well at the moment but is he captain a ball i dont think he is so all roads lead to son madison the big thing this week was that he got taken off at halftime he was playing well but they needed to change things and he was the one that went so i think all roads lead to on personally unless you need a cheaper option then i think you probably just go brennan because the value is there interesting i see i think all roads lead to brennan with this touch touches in the box 64 for brenan johnson interesting keski isnt isnt far off that with 62 so having like 10 touches in the box a match essentially i havent fact checked this mark southern sent me he did also send me boers tweet to take it with a pinch of soul but he told me brenans touches in the box is identical to harlands in terms of her so you think about parlans position his average position and where he just stands or johnson is getting that many touches in the box from out from out wide i know i brennan looks nailed now doesnt he i think hes going to be playing every game for them moving forward kisi i think is as well son weve been told by andre already that hes going to be managed this season he cant be playing every single game 90 minutes hes got to be managed a bit more so you would think that raras and verer are going to be coming on for son and maybe verer coming on for salanki so that koseski role i think i think between koseski and brennan i think theyre fine and theyre an awful lot cheaper as well i do have a soft spot for koski but i just think son is there and hes the one youd want to captain in 11 and 13 would you captain brennan johnson in 11 and 11 in 11 or 13 against ipswitch will f him no i wouldnt but im not looking at im not looking at alternative captains other than other than harland at the moment i think if i think if holland wasnt in the picture it would it might be it might be a bit different whos holland got in third who city got in 13 is that the brighton game city of liverpool away okay so you so you probably do need an extra captain lets get the lets get the ticker up hang on so in 13 city have liverpool youve got that great spurs game against fulham im looking at chelsea with villa at home thats not too bad either arsenal with west ham away i dont know would i rather have son than saaka or palmer thats the thing that i keep coming back to i just dont think i would sacka is the one because i think sacka by the time you get to 12 if hes fit again which will most likely happen youre looking at sacka in 12 back because youre going to want to be getting on some of those arsenal assets again potentially but palmer if you dont own palmer now when do you think is the entry point when do you think i need to get him back in for that game you is the leer one in 12 you have you have to get him in 12 dont you so if youre getting lester if youre getting him in 12 and you need son for 13 because he looks the best captaincy option or a or spurs when how are you going to own all these players by well i dont i dont think son i dont think son is needed that ive said this from the start of the season its its probably going to come back and bite me when sons ends up to the top scorer in fpl like that but if im looking at son compared to saaka palmer salah harland hes the fifth one for me out of those hes the one im im picking last and the fulham game isnt its not like southampton at home or rip switch at home hes got him in 11 harland has brighton where he will get chances against us believe me so do i need to get do i need to get some full at home when palmers got villa at home i dont mind that for palmer and then palmers got him switching south antony for side i think palmers got to be a mustone from 12 isnt he i the more you look at it as well hes in 12 hes got leicester in 14 hes got southampton the big thing for me with palmer now is like and i mentioned this on scoutcast about five weeks ago is that hes one of the only players that can go big anymore like i dont when you look at other players and you think harland can salah still has it in him but hes slowed down a little bit compared to what he used to be sacka doesnt massively go big i know he has what twice but you wouldnt expect it in a game week whereas palmer against the right oppos position just goes mental and hes not playing in europe i just think when youre looking at those fixtures its not like you have to look and say but hes he might play midweek hes not going to so i feel like palmer from 12 is a musthave so its just when the rest of them come in but like you just said if you swerve son and you go for a koseski or a brennan johnson it means you can get on a sacker and a palmer quite easily in 12 the alternative is youve got youve got j johnson compared to to son there about 3m saving there you could go jackson over palmer theres going to be what a 4m saving there no lets stop you could do or you go havs over sacka right and thats thats your 15m saving i was going to ask you which of those you think is a decent a decent tradeoff im guessing its not its not jackson its not its not either i dont think i dont think i want either over them as gone hello is it just me whats happened has as disappeared i have no idea whether its just me hello im assuming this is just me im waiting for him to come back in rip as just you andy cartel got him he mentioned too much hes back again do what this is one good thing though about streamyard is awful is what ive learned from this whole experience has been not because of you because were having to wait we have to pause between each bloody thing so we can we can speak they were just talking to me it was lovely but at least one of us can like leave and come back in it doesnt kill the whole stream true i was i was just saying if we are looking to save some money like where can you go foden to harlands the other one isnt it do you ever think foden is going to be a replacement for him no not at the moment no and we talked to luke quite a bit and hes saying like there i we dont see a time at the moment where fodens going to be nailed on because that hes not going to play him on the wings and that midfield three with gundan is where he wants to go and he seems scared of teams playing in counterattack so it doesnt look like theres going to be a fixture where you can say fodens definitely going to play even this week and i dont think fodens a good buy this week because a lot of people with foden are probably going to be moving off him in a couple of weeks so its tough and its a shame because you want them but i dont feel like theres over a longer period of time i dont feel like you can compromise on sacka palmer and harland i just dont think you can whereas son could be one you compromise on but the others i just dont think they are of course theyre all on penalties as well which is such a major factor too ive got ive got foden probably until gw 12 and then and then im probably going to be losing him for palmer in some way losing foden before spurs at home though doesnt feel amazingly amazingly good if he play but thats the thing you think thats going to be a case all season do you think fodens going to be a doubt all season or you reckon hes eventually going to be straight hes going to be number one its a shame i think he is i thought kdb being out i thought that nailed him on but i think with rodri being out and gundan coming in and the fact that hes quite scared of that midfield not being secure enough against teams he seems to keep picking gundan who i dont think has been great since hes come back either and i think it just means that foden ends up being the player that doesnt play and what savio is great at the last night and so is matas nunes as well and i just think fodens being turned into little bit of a scapegoat and not getting the minutes were expecting and coupled with the fact that hes had a bit of an injury too its meant that unfortunately one of those explosive players from last year were now having second outs about and its not like we havent got other options like i said you got saaka palas son and thats just naming three of them and then youve also got players like inmo so all of a sudden it just becomes foden is a bit more dispensable this season than he was last season its got mahrez vibes hasnt it like when we all thought mahrez was going to be first name on the team sheet when hed been playing well week after week after week he gets he gets benched mar has never won play of the season like foden did last year and it does seem surprising that hes potentially going that way but he has had history with pet before la last season was the blip for foden because he played pretty much every game before they i know i know and to be honest i thought that was it then but i think things have changed i think the rodri injury did shock it did shake them quite a lot as well to lose him for the whole season i think is massive for them and i just think ive always said with foden last year he was playing every game so it was absolutely fine and when harland didnt play or de bron didnt play he was he was another focal point which is awesome as well but i just think this year hes turned into a player that were having doubts about every week and you dont want to invest in too many players youre having doubts about every week and like i said theres alternative so ill be getting rid of him for palmer most likely not this week itd be 12 were all saying that because marks in the chat with ar and hes saying he doesnt feel confident about phone and regrets buying him and wants to move elsewhere all three of us have got him and were all feeling same way but and remember as well weve got fent and lewis so its its every week youre looking thinking if both of those are benched like thats a massive hit to your team and the upside hasnt been there yet so thats the other issue like hopefully when he does play and if he plays this week we could be absolutely loving life and he scored in champ league as well so well see what happens but hes not as certain as he was last year thats for sure weve got a little bit sidetracked just to come back to the spurs assets table i saw a question asking us to rank these in order just to just for the podcast listeners son comes out top on terms of points per 90 71 and hes mentioned kazis assist potential hes the highest on show out of som brell and kvi madison and sanki 34 pretty much brennans the one whos getting those shots away getting the shots in the box hes having those touches all in the area as well slanky is having the best chances if you look at xg per shot non penalty 026 thats the highest so when he is getting an opportunity its the highest xg shot and he has had the most big chances as well with eight compared to brenan six so he so sinki is still there im not like you say when i watch him im not that impressed but the stats dont make me think hes an awful option i just think brennan is probably the one i if you could offer me those if you offer me the swap for free i think id probably take you up on it i its interesed that though like salanki i think is fine because hes that striker position and when youre looking at strikers i think harland salanki wood seems to be the ideal three at the moment in terms of fixtures looking forward and form and things like that but that midfield slot i think is quite tough son its im fighting in the back of my head with keep it simple and simple as son because i can afford son and thats just keeping it simple hes the goal scorer but i do think brennan and koseski at that discount you it cant be ignored and i do get what youre saying with brennan johnson ive just got this thing in my head that brennan johnson is g to revert to type soon but as kfy i ive owned koseski before and hes done well but again hes got his issues where hes not a goal scorer so i think ill probably end up with son but kulu is the one in the back of my head but are you going to bren this week or are you is this just the one youd pick if you could no im not my transfer well i be interested to get your take on my transfer because im im doing these match of the day notes on twitter and the reason for that is i want to give myself a reason to watch match today because i didnt watch it religiously last year and i had my worst ever season and i think i was watching a lot of live football but i think sometimes its nice to get a bit more of a broader overview of whats of whats going on and i think match to day is helpful because they break down the tactics and you see players that you might not otherwise have seen or mentioned and i have to say the player that ive been impressed with for a little while and particularly i thought against brenford was your was your mate garnacho your boy i thought he was unb i think he had eight shots in that game against brenford i just think hes taken it a bit personally being benched in those first few matches and theres always question marks around man utd and whether tar can get them playing any brand of football that doesnt rely on individual brilliance but he is a hell of a player isnt he gacho and the fixtures again were going to come back to the fixtures graphic but the next five for man utd west ham chelsea leicester ip switch everton four of those five games against four of the weakest teams in the league well five if you include chelseas defensive you see exact so i theres been so many false dorms with united and it happens every season every season we got hang on theyve started looking good again i will say that front three of rashford gacho and holand did look good and i think holand is the one that weve missed because xerx is not that type of player i do think that looked good bruno that assist was absolutely beautiful by the way and if anybody else did that wed be talking about it for ages but i do think na would be the one to own especially if he continues to play on the left and i think for the fixtures weve got coming up especially after this week i think west hams fine but the fact that weve then got leicester at home everton at home and we got i switch away i think they are investable in but its who are you buying him instead of and if youre buying him instead of a spurs asset i dont think id do that i think id want a piece of that spurs pie and then i think you could probably wait until 11 because i dont think youd invest ahead of chelsea even though their xgc is so low i dont think you would so i think youd probably be waiting till 11 but from 11 onwards i think a gun at is not that bad we could even see a rashford resurgence which he was about 80 owned at one point after co wasnt he so ive just im used to this with united theres been so many false dawns and you think youre getting in there early and you just end up going at the wrong time so but garache would be the one i think ive already got salanki i could double up on it as a sp thats what marks doing hes got slanky hes already moved for johnson hes going one step further and buying a player we havent even mentioned from spurs which is porro as well bringing in por bringing in por this week so hes going hard on spurs i think im gonna im gonna pivot away from it and have a bit of a punt on gacho i had him last season i feel like he owes me i benched him for two braces last season yes i remember that which he was cheap as chips last year wasnt he was hes five million was i think i got at 49 something like that and again its stupid but playing a 49 asset feels rough playing a 62 asset feels a bit better even though its the same player its just how a feel works this is a new graph that graph chart that marks put together this is so the this is game we nine xgi of course game week eight xgi so this is xgi just for the game week and i think again this goes quite nicely with like talking about match of the day and highlights and what you see from individual game weeks we look at the stats we look at like a longterm view and last six game weeks is typically what we look at also can we to see who were the the top performers in individual game week i mentioned gachos shots hes not in the top 30 that i could see for xgi non penalty so they werent exactly great chances but he was having a lot of them brenan not though i wanted to talk about playing for leicester hes at the top of this 15 i was impressed with him this week havent been since he signed for leicester hes looked all right for briyan when ive seen him play hes come with a big reputation i think tz said he was going to be the next liel messi which is little bit of hype to live up to hasnt delivered i dont think brighton ever knew what his best position was tried to put him on the right hasnt got the pace for that we had a lot of players who could play in the 10 but delivering at leicester what your thoughts on him i dont hate him at all i think hes hes playing all right i think leicester fixtures what they got forest not great potentially but then ipswitch and then from 13 onwards it looks a little bit rosier so i dont hate him as a pick i i play so rare ive got him in that and hes absolutely killed it in that in the last couple of weeks so im very happy there its just i think weve got other players that are cheap options to say like are you going to go with a bonon not or are you going to go with a rogers i think is the comparison because youre not going to want more than won midfielder at 5m and rogers has been the absolute bargain so far this season and i think stop it stop it im not too im not totally sure about that i think that i think can well if you we look at some of the players on this list midfield is around five million so youve got buon not okay hes probably not too many people going there but i think hes a hes a decent option seeno is on here at 56 two rough games fixtures on exactly two rough games but you get through those and then its its a decent run do you think smith row is now just not a consideration for us at f im i mentioned that so on scoutcast two weeks ago hibbo and nacho were saying smith row is still a good and i was thinking i dont know whether he is anymore i would much rather have a rogers over him id much rather have a bonon not potentially although like i said the fixtures maybe arent there enough for me but i still think rogers is the one if i was wild card and rogers would be on it 100 and then youve got patrick flor saying no mcneel i think mcneils an option at 56 with the fixures theyve got i love mcneil ab rutter at brighton is welbeck still out well herzel has said that he it sounded painful he said hed like knocked a nerve in his back like that and he was still in quite a lot of pain id be very surprised if he if he started against walls ferguson played 60 minutes im not sure hes got a bit of a knock as well but it could be rter up front if ferguson and welbeck are both out we might see rter up top not sure wholl then play at the 10 maybe gruda comes in at 10 or they push like a bber up to that role but i think rutters looking like we paid 40 billion for him it raised a lot of eyebrows hes looking like a good player for us do the one player im going to mention and this is my like my differential i think hes like 3 owned is is dams guard for brenford hes on set piece is hes looked good hes got three assists in his last two games i think hes someone especially with their fixtures coming up as well what they got ip switch bournemouth lester all at home you could youre gonna be wanting to play him potentially i think if you could have a double up with him and aumo and then have those three premiums i quite like that so damars my little one hes not on this is he but hes hes one that im gonna tip moving forward okay well in the sleeper draft the wire have got dams guard and i know i know zal was talking up on the video they did today so i think they probably agree with you on that two more players i wanted to mention on this list one of them you own already chris wood 091 seven points for him gimenez ral gimenez 57m next 074 if we jump ahead and we come to the forwards table both are where are they on this list so where wood is 17th i saw them earlier wood is 17th and jimenez i dont think is jimenez is eighth on this say 63 for him and wood at 39 woods expected gold per 90 is pretty low isnt it at 39 thats the first thing i saw 78 accuracy and 31 conversion surely thats not sustainable surely i think he looked good he could have got more on monday night i genuinely i think he is he is such a good option if i was wild card in this week i am almost certain i would have chris wood in my team if i was wild card in after this week i might move to somebody else maybe like a ca or al larson because i think they might start coming into teams with wolvess fixtures changing and i think theres going to be a bit of an uptick there but i think woods fine i feel i feel like if youve got wood now he if youve got wood now youre going to keep him and youre going to be more than happy with the fact that youve got him but if you dont he is going to be the player that you do not move to every week and hes just going to keep it theres always a striker like this always a striker i swear every season that does this and hes just going to be that one where people are like no he wont carry it on and hell just keep plooding away i reckon its funny is it because at start of the season everyones saying not only is he is he not gna is he not going to do that well but hes not going to play because alanai is going to come back and take his place that that has just been put completely to b nuno likes him i think he likes what he brings the side and hes almost built its a prettyy exciting attack with hudson ado gibs white and elanga but its all about anderson was unreal absolutely unreal so its like a like a man city light instead of harland up top theyve got chriswood christ is this just you trying to bring mark back next week saying all the lovely things about him i wood has been mark has got it wrong about wood he was pretty anti him in the start of the season and i think he always thought that tyra would have eventually come back and take him but hasnt done so i were on borrow time with you now were were six minutes past eight youve got a tesco delivery arriving any minute itll be coming any minute mate bit of i know its like this its all the track can talk about but itll be here in a minute i would have thought well before lets theres still some stuff i can cover i can i can carry on when youre gone but lets jump ahead quickly just to your team for the week in case you do have to jump out im sure people will be desperate to know what your what your plans are al they can watch them on the scout cast i doubt theyve changed too much but this is your team read out for the podcast thiss and tell us what youre what youre thinking so i got flecken in goal ip switch at home gabrielle pedro porro rico lewis foden and bumo rogers sacka who is yellow flagged at the moment and then salanki harland and wood up top with harland as my captain minkovich first on my bench seeno and greaves dont know where that injury came from but greaves is out for about four weeks unfortunately and valdar ss my on the bench i am pretty happy with this team this week i think this team looks fine this week ive already got that triple up with city ive got double up with brenford which is in buan fleen its a pretty good fixture there my main move im looking at this week is sacka out and it will be for a spurs mid its just which mid i go for i think ill just end up going son but i am very tempted to save the money and then move from foden up to palmer got money in the bank so ive got 17 in the bank so i can move sacka to anybody i could even go to palmer now if i wanted to but i think i will go for a spurs mid its just which one i go for but your voice then i know i dont know what happened sps mid but the one thing i will say is i dont want to move down from sacka and then spread the funds i want to keep those price points because i want those two premiums in midfield so i dont want to mess it around too much but sacka will most probably be going out i have no idea whether hes going to play this week and even if he does i dont expect a lot from arsenal in that fixture i think that is as tough a fixture as its going to get for them so im pretty sure thats what im going to do its between son and koseski i think sorry because you and mark are both going to be trebled on spurs and that just isnt something that i would consider i dont fully trust them i know their attacks been good but they went down against west ham theyve they threw away a two goal lead against us they were awful in the second half against leicester in the first game they seem to have good spells and theyre not so good spells theyre not theyre not a very reliable team for a triple up on potentially but then they were top of the xgc they were top of xg on your table and i look at it and just think with those two fixtures coming up in 11 and 13 to have that triple spurs and potentially the captain one of them as well those are the games where you can get massive games and i just think why not go for a triple up captain one of them and if it hits youre flying and i think thats the thing i quite like at the moment ive done it with city i went early on foden which im quite happy i did because otherwise id be second guessing whether to go for him now so the fact ive got triple city this week this is the week where im hoping to hit big with them as well so i think you can do that every now and again and this is what ive wanted to do so im pretty sure im going to do it okay no man united players for a good run you faith yes maybe a gun out show but i its tough moving him in with all those other players i want ill show you my team the order of this stream has gone completely out of the window technical issues stream out the window youre off to do a s a tesco delivery its all its all carnage this is my team its raying goal with trent lewis and moreno im playing him tomorrow against lester away foden and bumo seeno rogers harland watkins and sanki up top ward gabrielle davis and dibling on the bench i could do smeno to johnson ive got the money to do it but i think im going to take the punt on garnacho as i said i like it just something a bit different i think hes like eight owned something like that i remind you this in two weeks i know i know and all the people on these all these people the on the video as hat united hes never going to bring in united player and all that its like well thatll shut you up when i have one in my team would it im play every are you going to are you going to wait till the last minute and get the lead before you get gacha in or are you ill see what comes through in the cartel whatsapp group and make the decision on that i will be hoping for a leak on moreno because theres always a chance he could miss out for im assuming my request to join the cartel is still pending on the pending youre not youre not a patreon member yet so thats true give us your give us your eight quid a month whatever it is and then you can cool i see what i can do big question though andy the big question that we havent even covered yet and it doesnt show it on this graphic but it is currently active on my actual fpl team triple captain any consideration for it no none at all no i just dont think i would ever play it in a single game week just dont think i would i the fixture is there and the people that did it against dip switch and you got the hattick 17 points times three lovely but double game week you you only have to get a goal in each game and max bonus and youre beating that so i will not be doing it this week and i would be absolutely shocked if i did it in a single game week in any season i dont even know what the double game weeks are going to be but it could be that i dont go with harl it could be i put it on salah could be i put it on someone else palmer potentially so no i 100 wont be doing it but little birdie tells me you might be im about im 6040 in favor of playing it im im im a bit annoyed with myself i didnt play on him against ip switch because mark and i did the match of day challenge mark didnt own harland it would have been fun to have gone into that challenge with him with all triple captain i did have it on him very briefly and then i took it off and i thought its a bit too early for that like game week was it game week three was it game week two was game week two wasnt it against z switch i just thought that was a little bit early my reasoning for thinking about it now is that ive seen southampton play and i cant remember too many teams who play as badly in defense as theyve done its its the perfect blend of a manager who isnt changing his philosophy and in some ways fair enough thats how they got promoted he doesnt want to change but do you need to adapt a little bit to the premier league well it doesnt look like martins done that at all is individual mistakes from the defenders and its just an overall real lack of quality in that southampton team like ramale was a good signing for them hes not a bottom three goalkeeper but that defense that midfield the fact theyve not got any like out ball to a to a stri and i know theyve got archer but you almost want them to have a big man up top that they could at least a leave bit pressure and win the ball high up and hold it up they dont seem to have that i just dont know how it can happen that city dont score multiple goals against them at the weekend whats your expectation on minutes by the way my my the doors just gone so ive gotta go thats it youre gna go pleasure as always thank you guys i had a i had a message lined up for that and he needs to go put his petty fu away this is the first time ive ever done a proper episode of ffi black box on my own and i did the team selections last season but havent done them on my own so i thought i could just carry on for a little bit ive got a couple more charts go through the predictions can answer some questions and things that people might have its just me if you dont like listening to me then probably best you drop off because im g to watch the numbers go down crazily but if you if you want to stick around and we can we could do another half an hour or so then lets go for it i do need another beer though should i grab that now should grab that in a bit not too sure anyway lets carry on for a little bit more lets talk about some of the other tables that weve that weve got so lets go through the main one so this is defenders over the season you saw on my team earlier that i had leaf davis at the in the starting 11 hes third for exped gold 90 at 24 the question marks are around whos going to score the chances that hes he creating hes a creator of chances shots per 90 when you compare that to trent is half you to porro two its a lot a lot lower than that but the chan he creating is high 25 is the highest its now higher than trent i think he was second going into the league trent had a had a difficult game but davis is creating chances a reasonable rate theres just no one that can has grab the bill we right well do okay i do defender tables then ill go grab a beer so i do like davis i just dont know and mark said this on the video he did early in the week the lets walk fbl is it enough to be creating chances when theres not anyone who can who can put them away and i think weve spoken about fors weve spoken about himz and kuna and stran larson i think dap was big flavor of the month going into the everton game and now its its massively gone down to some of the others so well see how we switch bounce back from pretty bad losses to lose that heavily to west ham and then to lose to everton in that manner i think mckenna is going to be worried you they come out of a bad run they want to start getting points on the board and then its a bit of an issue so hes hes still in my team but i dont think im gon to be playing him for the for theable i mentioned porro marks bringing him in this week nine goals conceded is the problem he hasnt had the attacking returns he got that goalen game week one not anything else yet i thought l impressive in the west ham game getting full a lot i do wonder if brennan cutting in means porro goes out a bit wider means that hes not getting as close to goal as he maybe was last season hes still getting chance hes still getting opportun he had that shot near the end which was absolutely awful but it was from the right the right area so i think hes hes a decent option this week i play i played davis over moreno and i do wonder if it is like a clean sheet first policy that we need to adapt with defenders i think particularly this season when the bonus doesnt favor attacking defenders the bonus does favor the clean sheets you clean sheet for a defender we i think it was murillo sals did aa get a bonus in that in that forest game maybe not but its the its taking multiple attacking returns almost for defenders to get something from it so a bit of a bit of a concern im not im not totally sold on po i think five5 is a bit too much for him but if youve got him i hold him i dont think id be ill be buying him is there any else on this list that inspires im not totally sure there is i think minkovich is a good shout if youve got him hes 20th on this list he has an assist i think he got that the week before last i think hes hes probably the stand out in that in that bracket i dont mind anor either but those fullbacks dont seem to be getting forward a lot too much so i think milinkovic would be the one if youre looking to tap into to forest nor 13 two goals two assists not point2 exra p maybe expecting that to be a little bit higher given the attacking returns that hes got maybe suggest that hes been a little bit lucky but i think hes gonna be pretty popular brighton are gonna thrash him this week so dont buy him yet but going forward the fixures are pretty decent for them couple more that we flagged here we got manning at southampton climbing up the thing look at his chan to created for 90 in the top 10 thats why were featuring him vanderberg in 4 not sure what happens with rico henry when hes back but 4m i think vanderberg is probably the one to go for and you got moleno popular seven points and from himly keane got the got the big hole but mikeno didnt do b mikeno didnt do badly 89th on the list though it doesnt look like youre going to get much from these everton defenders so youve got to hope for those one nil wins that we know d is capable of but again if you got him at 4 five hes probably a bit of a keep so theres some decent option defense theres no one that i dont think anyones a mustone trent and gabrielle obious got the tough fixtures lewis is a hold but isnt getting the clean sheets i think his minutes are pretty safe i think walkers being phased out a little bit maybe its a bit of a shame that stones has made a bit of resurgence because he can play in that inverted role but im hoping that lewis carries on vels 18th going to pay a little bit more for him two goals in the last couple of games hes a good pick as well but no one i think we said this a lot last season about defenders not having too many standouts i think were getting that again this year so when ive got trent who have i got ive got trent gabrielle theyre okay ive got lewis im reasonably happy with ive got moreno that could be any not kn forest defender im pretty happy with those going forward so not looking to make any defensive moves in the in the near future right im going to grab a beer im going to stick the stting soon back on no technical issues im hoping at this stage its a bit annoying with andy were a little bit delayed so thanks for sticking around a couple of people have left with it just me but still 770 people watching again were caring for about another half an hour or so im going to grab a beer and i will see you all in about five minutes i am back and what is better than one beer sure the answer its two beers there we go thanks for sticking around everyone still 700 people watching this which is amazing if you i know its a thursday night but if you fancy grabbing a alcoholic or a nonalcoholic drink and joining me as we just rattle through the rest of these tables thatd be great andy is getting his tesco delivery and then he has got his community thing where he does that educational id like to think its like a seminar that he does so if youre if youve enjoyed listening to andy tonight hes always great to have on standby for these things then check out his community and get involved in that right lets have a look at the mids to cheeky hazy james absolutely i dont like brog as a company theres all the problems the owner has had in the past and im im not a big fan of how they how they operate but unfortunately they do make a pretty decent beer and im a bit of a sellout so thats where thats where were at right lets look at midfielders jaks shaking in the background he all right its fine midfielders then so i mentioned garnacho he doesnt feature well on the list for the last the last we show which was on the xg for the game week hes showing up highly though on here hes 13th on the list 57 x non penalty for 90 i always say around 06 is your like elite elite numbers if you if youve got a player whos consistently getting around 06x non for 90 i said that puts him in a pretty good position when you consider the fact hes 62m as well i think thats nice inter that is identical to seeno who i would be selling for him the amount of shots seeno has is crazy he does have some from outside the air i think hes had the most shots of all midfielders which isnt shown on this on this table but in terms of those shots in the box for 90 297 ranks him to just below salah 298 look at br though 388 thats the highest of all of all midfielders but garnacho 269 decent touches in the box per 90 737 for him thats higher than s think just making some hacking nois in the background thats nice ive disturbed he was fast asleeping so went and got these got these beers so it maybe feels a little bit sideways doing that doing that seeno toono move its villa away next for simo then its man city i think he could get some joy in those i dont think selling is a if you were going to keep him i wouldnt say its a terrible move lets put it that way im just trying to tap into those slightly better fixures for and hes a player that i just genuinely like and im not seeing him many teams so theres a few reasons there to get rid of him savio is fifth on this list i think hes an interesting one as well if you are looking to go for someone a bit different in the man city attack i thought he played brilliantly in the champions league last night hes looked good in the games that ive ive seen him play he was amazing for jona last year thats why city of the ball i dont think weve seen that player from him in terms of that output if you look at some of these numbers look at those touches in the box per 90 992 thats in the top five for midfielders the ex 9 is high as i mentioned 71 and i wonder when his that right hand spot of the city team does feel up for grabs and hes clearly got hell of a lot of talent so i think its going to be sooner rather than later we see him see him break in the trouble is do you weigh or do you take a punt on it for this southampton game i think again hes someone thats thats flying under the radar he might even be some i was considering but im im already tripled up with lewis foden and harland someone to consider malison sats a great on in 85 ex on 90 but andy mentioned his early sub i think thats a bit of a concern when the players going off halftime poo klu said they werent controlling the game which is rare for him to say that i think hes said in the past that he doesnt care about how much they control it as long as they score goals and get the win but they need to do something to get a handle on that west ham game and it was definitely that sub that changed things around and kf impact that he had i think after that sub was made so i think hes now a bit too risky and weve already talked about the spurs players i still think johnson is the one to go for but i dont blame people for going for son because we know what his pedigree is like its just that its just that sanky role we give him a couple of weeks s does but if hes blanked again in the next couple hes going to be someone that we that we look to take out i dont think its fair to talk about midfielders though without talking about morgan rogers at 5m at the start of the season hes not showing up on these stats you have to go down to 4 first to find him 38 hes not in the top 10 for touching the box hes not in the top 10 for chances created his points per 90 is 447 its decent but its not crazy this is where i think watching games having a bit of making sure youre watching different teams not just your team when theyre theyre on tv and using the eye test is clear because rogers to me is looking like he could be one of the if he made team of the season the way hes playing at the moment i dont think anyone would be would be too surprised he is so key to everything aston villa are trying to build whether its in europe and he was i think he was man of the match in the game the other night every game ive seen him play hes demanding the ball hes making the runs his end product is maybe lacking a little bit and i think if he starts adding those goals to his game what is his potential for five milli hes never going to be a palmer were never going to have a palmer again i dont think at five million but if rogers goes on and could get 170 180 points and kick on from where he is now hes goingon to go down as one of the best value picks of all time and i think thats more likely that trajectory for him than he gets phased out and doesnt become a an impact for us so if youre listening to this and you havent got rogers youre always going to have other priorities maybe to go for the big hitters and the moving around but when it comes to saving money and you want to bring some money out of maybe some of the other midfielders even if the pictures arent that good i still would suggest that you take a look at rogers because i just think hes hes hes an absolutely unreal player and i wonder how long its goingon to be to gets caught up for england surely hes got to be ts got to be looking at that and thinking hes a player that can offer us something a little bit different because if you think about de bry for city and the way he can get the ball in midfield and just drive forward we need more players like that in the in the england squad from that central role that maybe hunt foden because foden has never delivered for england so rogers had to had to mention him the other player i wanted to mention here just move on is fatu as well of leicester thought he changed the game when he came on against southampton i know harrys got madidi hes i saw his podcast where he was wondering why hes hes got him i dont think he was a bad pick at all i was tempted to go there at the start of the season theres now other five options who are looking a bit better with jamie vardy with madidi and with fatua theyve got some real players that can hurt teams and again hes not one youre gonna buy now but i think hes hes someone to watch because hes got that explosiveness in him where over this run of games lester have got once we see him naed in that team i do wonder if he could present a bit of an interesting alternative but well have to wait and see a little bit on him forwards so this is the interesting position im stacked in my forward spot ive got harand 15m for him 10 goals three consecutive blanks but the stats are just absolutely obscene as they always will be over the season its more of a blip isnt it weve already seen the champions league hes gonna hes hes hes going to revert back to form pretty soon ive got watkins who i know quite a few people maybe have maybe bend off in the last few weeks hes been doing well for me there is some concerns that hes getting benched a bit earlier than youd like 65 70 minutes he did was benched in the champions league game as well duran got his sure its not his first start is it maybe i think it is his first other than other than the cup but we imagine watkins is going to come back in good game against bournemouth then its away at spurs as well i dont hate even those fixures for him then its probably a case of moving him on to a palmer when those fixtures turn around so harand slanky and and watkins im pretty stacked up top i do think im missing a bit of a trick with some of the cheaper forwards weve mentioned quite a few of these already i think jimenez is the standout for me four goals and assists for him hes in that purple patch era that he was he was in before his awful head injury hes an incredible player all his day f are playing well eight points per 90 for someone that costs 57m is just an absolute bargain so i think if you are considering one of these cheaper strikers hes probably the one to go for i think we rule out cal lein i know the fix is good he cant score youve got to be able to score and he cant we look at we look at coa as well given the fixures have turned around for him the importance that hes got in that side i dont mind that i dont mind strand larson if you want to go down even further and save a bit of money i wonder if the ship sailed a little bit on chriswood given the fixtures i think he should do all right against leicester i would back him to score in that its just from that the fixtures arent great if he does score against lee hes going to be popular given his given his price to be fair its west ham and newcastle its not a bad run is it then if switch in 13 i take it back hes i reckon hes probably still a good pick up even after even after leicester but leicester west ham and newcastle then ni switch in 13 is he better than gimenez know let me think let me let me know would you rather go jimenez or or wood go m forward probably is quite close between them isnt it i think id go those two overa for some reason i thought wood had like tough games coming up but hes other that arsenal game they all look pretty decent so hes hes definitely a consideration the stats arent arent too great other than that not a huge amount of options is there isack was someone i thought could end up being in our teams all season that injury was it going to take for him to become a bit of a consideration for us probably quite a lot vs back in contention for brenford the fixures arent bad for him either 77 ex with 90 was very popular before the injury that he had again i think theres probably better options in there and whats happened with mata i owned mata earlier in the season i got that brace from him were all talking about the fact that he was it the second most go goal since glasner took over but unceremoniously dropped and getu is getting the nod so i wonder know how long thats going to go on for i dont think mata can be too happy when palace arent scoring goals and hes been dropped and hes being such a key man for them trigger lips is in the chat he ask who im talking to thats a good question trick i do often wonder that as well im just here talking to myself pretty much as as the views have gone up to 705 thanks for all sticking with me and cheers ive missed these solo streams theres something theres something a little bit theyre relaxing in the way but also a littleit bit frantic because you youve got to keep talking you cant have too much time just to sit and have like a silence when you

discord channel is growing and i love interacting with people on that eds brother ed from scout his brothers has done like the intro video for us which we love weve had other people do the graphics fb poker playay has done the sound for us and now weve got le and liv doing things like the prediction website that weve got which if youre a godfather team member you can track all the predictions that youre that youre putting in and see how you compare to others they built us this graphic so mark and i can track our predictions and enter them in where would we be without the community and its been a bit of a tough week for me in the community this week for anyone thats following that but theres so much of it that i that i i still love and still enjoy so do just want to say thanks for anyone whos whos helped out mark and i because it does it does mean a lot to us just someones point out theyre not in order which is br w stop chris this was something that i learned from james last week that the games that so the three oclock games for example are in alphabetical order so it would be aston villa brenford brighton man city its just not something id ever thought about but it is weird them not being its that does this so lee if youre watching this from australia make sure these are now best cl or people are going to start kicking off lets ratt through these though its ler forest tomorrow night im playing moreno i dont feel too good about it i think forest probably win this game i think woods gonna get something out of it as well but i think leicester scor they scored in every match so far its a great comeback against southampton too but i think forest have just got a bit about them at the moment i think theyre defense is nice i like minkovich and i like murillo ss is looking like a decent goalkeeper now too theyve got good attacking options theyve theyve built the team around getting wood service and i think theyll theyll won this one out i do think leer are picking up though id written them off maybe at the start of the season but i think theyve got options and i think out of the three promoted teams theyre by far the most likely to stay up man city southampton this is going to be a blood bath surely ive gone for a 40 so as mark i have harand trible captain in my team currently i think they score multiple goals i think southampt are going try and low block but i also dont think theyre going to change their philosophy passing around the back i unless they completely change the way they play i think theyre still going to try and kick it around and try and find a bit of space i dont think theyve got a good out ball to get the ball to and i think city going to exploit it with the pressure that theyve got and the players theyve got i just think its going to be a tough day for southampton so 40 hopefully some foden and lewis involved but harand getting all four of those goals would be lovely brighton wolves i think we win this and if you remember matas solo goal he scored last season one of the best goals i think ive ever seen great for a repeat on that i was impressed with brighton given that we had players come out for international break we had like m injured wck went off injured we had weve had pro weve had like thumpings from chelsea weve recovered its been a exciting season already for us im impressed with r i think hes a hes a real differential if youre looking for someone completely different for a onewe punt and i think well have a bit too much for wolves but i like wolves and i want to see them start getting some points that they that they deserve so ive gone for ive gone for two one here and its its a 31 for mark brenford ip switch greaves is out i think this could be a big win for brenford again i quite like it switch so maybe ive gone a little bit a little bit lower than maybe i should have done twonil for them marks gone for a 30 inmo should come out of this with something good got the brace against southampton and the fellow promoted team i think he could do very well in this one so if you havent got inmo i think if i harlands the biggest concern if you havent got him but i think bs got to be up there right im expecting him to come away from this with a with a double digit villa bournemouth very impressed with bournemouth so far this season i think that defeat against leicester was surprising but in other games theyve looked good ive gone for twonil villa and this one though theyre another team i just think theyll theyll get the win in this and looking at those defensive numbers surely at some point the clean sheets are going to come marks given bournemouth a goal in this a twonil for villa with rogers and watkins would be lovely as the dream result for me last time with both of them scoring this a shame rogers seems to get booked every time he scores or it would have been a bigger hall everton fham ive gone for a 21 fulam marks gone for a 11 see theres a bit about everton at the moment start pick up a couple of wins a couple of clean sheets in the last two games two i just think the form of himz with smith row supplying is going to be enough to see them through on this i think we might start regretting selling smith row i know a lot of us have done if youve still got him i think hes still a perfectly fine hold to have in your team so im backing f him in this one west ham man united i think of all the teams ive been least impressed with this season southampton probably bottom of my list and then west ham close to second bottom i just think theyre so easy to play against like you look at the space they were allowing spurs to have in that game why arent they packing the midfield why arent they making attempts to try and stifle like creative players like kazki was just given license just to completely run the show very strange and its not the first time weve seen them do that against chelsea i thought they were poor as well i think ipswitch flattered them the way he switch played and approached that game i just think its not a great its not a great time for them at the moment and i know man united playing tonight there a bit about them with hiling back weve gone at you in the fores in so im backing them to get that to get that one if there was a garden center game and thats what js says i think it probably is the west ham man united game though isnt it i wouldnt be canceling my plans to to to watch that one palace spurs ive gone for two1 spurs mars gone for 30 spurs i think if spurs were to win this 30 i think glar is going to start fearing for his job which seems unheard of after the end of the season they had last time out 30 no slanky no johnson and no no porro involvement i think that would be pretty unlikely i think this is the game we start seeing some points for johnson and sanki i think both are good picks going into this palace fans might start turning on their players a little bit you just never know what youre going to get with spur so if palace if palace score i dont think its going to be too surprising chelsea newcastle im jealous of palmer this week hes someone that i want in my team i look him every week and think hes hes got great potential hes getting one assist and getting bonus i thought he played well against liverpool as well i cant see any way he doesnt get something from this game havent been impress with newcastle they got the clean sheet against everton away but other than that they very rarely keep away clean sheets and chelsea are doing very well on the the expected goal involvement table for teams so im backing chelsea to win this i wouldnt be surprised if pmer had a same both of these goals and comes away with a big ho so definitely consider definitely consider of bringing him in if you dont already and then arsenal liverpool interesting game no celba for arsenal liverpool looking strong going to be a hell of an atmosphere at the emirates for this one i think a draw is probably the most likely given that new team is going to want to lose this one i think we have to consider liverpool as a title contender this year along with arsenal along with man city its going to be those three right at the top so i think i think arsenal will take a draw in this given that cbas out liverpool will probably be hoping they can they can create a few problems for arsenal when then get something marks gone for 21 in this for liverpool so we can see how that how that one goes i mentioned the prediction standings you can get involved in this if youre blackbox patron mark is currently beating me which is very frustrating with his 55 correct outcomes 9 correct scores im on 49 so ive gone under my 50 target but i have i think ive got one more correct score than mark has so mines mines at 10 im having to extend this list each time just to keep me on it so i definitely need to start picking up hottin is winning this with his total score of 73 59 correct outcome and 16 correct score incred and hes missed six matches and hes still top so congratulations to him andy who was on earlier hes just ahead of me hes on the 50 target 10 correct score so well done well done to him but if youre interested in getting involved in this head over to the blackbox patreon sign up and we can get you involved in in this competition theres a trophy for the for the winner which hottin is currently winning captain c this is it all just points to har doesnt it mean scks touch in the box for 90 106 his shots in the box is 31 those stats are encouraging for sacka but hes playing liverpool and hes a doubt so you cant consider him harlands next his 10 goals we dont need to talk about him hes going to be captured by pretty much everyone other than james from plan fpl who wont own him dont know who hes going to go for i imagine hes going to go for palmer with newcastle at home he could go for slanky away at palace given his spurs connection but i dont think he will i think hes probably going to go for palmer in thats who i go for if i didnt have harland fodens on this list as well if you think hes going to start and play centrally i think hes a potential option if you havent got harland we mentioned inmo as well home to ipswitch i think hes a good pick with his six goals this season but i think personally the question is do we captain or do we triple captain and as i said i think im leaning towards the triple captain this week this was my team i showed this earlier with andy the triple captain chip isnt active on this but it come is in my main team my move is going to be seeno to garnacho this week benching gabrielle playing ry trent lewis moreno foden ando garnacho rogers harland probably triple captain watkins and sanki so im hoping for a decent green arrow this week thats pretty much all the content ive got for this stream more than happy to i got two beers i think it was a bit optimistic and bar even started this one its hard to drink and talk to be fair if you want to get any questions in for me ill try and answer as many as i can ive got a couple of super chats to get through too so thank you for sending those in and thanks for sticking around theres 677 people watching live if you could drop a like on the video that would be amazing if youre watching this post youtube drop us a comment as well let us know if you enjoyed it and if youre listening on the podcast give us a festar review and drop us a review on that too these things like i keep saying about the community and how great it is being a being a i hate the phrase content creator but i dont know what else to call myself with this because i do create content it just feels like a bit of a wanky term but its a funny experience because i love it and i love talking football and i love doing blackbox with mark and i love interacting with people and stuff but there are times when it gets you down a little bit ive ive had quite i think ive probably had more negativity over the last couple of seasons than ive had in any other year that ive done it i think a lot of it does relate to rank and had a poor season last year its getting a little bit better this year but its not great is its not begging for compliments and stuff but its its nice to know that people enjoy the the podcast and the streams and things and ultimately if people werent enjoying them and they didnt they didnt like it then you would wouldnt bother the reason why mark and i stick around is because hopefully were were doing something that people like and we keep enjoying as long as those two things keep happening then then we carry on its some sometimes a bit a bit demoralizing sometimes but going private i think on twitter is definitely helping right lets take a look at andrew g thank you for the 499 super chat evening chats im 42m ive been there mate do not worry saaka diaz gabrielle and calv luin to palma foden gimenez and at nori for a minus 12 what i am i losing the plot a minus 12 i have taken a minus 12 twice in my life and both times it has not gone well i look at the four players youre looking at palmer foden himz and eight nory i like all four of those i look at the four youre taking out and think is there massive potential that they go off over the next few weeks saaka diaz gabrielle and calv lein sacas a doubt diaz has got tough fixtures and has missed out the last couple of games gabrielles got tough fixes k cant score i dont i dont hate it i dont hate it andrew if youve still got the wild card maybe its time to think about using that but if you havent im finding it hard to say no to it youre 42m youve got foden at 66 ownership youve got palmer whos a great pick himene in great form go for it im gonna say go for it unbelievable i like it andrew im not going to try and talk you a bit i know its for a minus 12 but i think its its big improvement to the rest of your squad caleb is in the chat caleb is one of our patreon tier members dont ask him for his opinion on goalkeepers because hes absolutely bloody useless picking them and hes asking me for a goalkeeper move reyya to onana god just stick with reyya caleb i know youve broken him and youre youre not seeing any joy from him but i still maintain arsenal are going to be one of the best defenses in the league theyve had three red cards in eight games its been a bit of some freaker occurrences i just think i know the fixures arent great but if arsenal do keep a clean sheet in the next couple of games hes gna have made a couple of saves and be in the bonus and man utd defensively im i know theyve theyve been theyve been okay but i dont fully trust them i would just leave it youre going to keep chasing goalkeeper halles youre going to miss out on ones from your own team ray is a good goalkeeper i would i would just stay with him davies family first play one of robinson or davis and one of seeno or smith row id definitely play smith row against everton so i think that ones quite easy id probably play robinson as well i think robinson and smith row i if you do i dont hate playing robinson and seeno but i would i would think that ive got film to beat ive got film to beat everton so i think play your two filam assets there theyre a good team this season hing good to see hing al some one of our patreon members is it worth a minus four to sw sacka to son hope to pay for your beer as all youre very kind is it worth a minus four to swap sacka to s thats a tough one again if we get a leak the cartel gets a leak sack is out it probably is it depends on your benches isnt it you might have a decent player on your ben if youve got seeno on your bench id probably just play him bring him in minus fours are tricky to get right depends what your what your plans are for some long term if youre going to look to get rid of him for palmer or someone in a few weeks its probably not worth it if you think youre going to keep him right up to game week 134 it might be the move to make id be a bit reluctant to take a minus four to swap sacka out i think sacka is gonna come back into consideration in a few weeks if he lines up against liverpool you might be wanting him back straight away id hold unless youre 5050 or less that hes not going to play and then you can consider it depending on who that bench on who that bench option is i wont read yours out super duper just because its i dont want to mention the person that youre talking about fbo gold you mark its a its a nice soy one you mark credit to the f community ignore the likes of a certain someone im sure you discussed foden but whats a summary im avoiding the summary is ive got him im happy with him i think he starts i think he plays centrally i cant see him playing on the left or on the right i dont think thats where pep wants to use him i spoke to luke about it luke thinks foden is at risk when pep wants to make sure hes got control of the midfield and if hes playing against like a combative side in midfield then he might be someone who drops out like we saw with wolves against southampton hes not anticipating much of a midfield battle and normi so hes hes pretty sure that fen is going to start in that i just think ranks are pretty low its game week eight we can take a punt on someone youve got sacka with tough fixtures and potentially injured know salah as well son is he the best option i dont know i just think theres theres there might not be too many opportunities to go for someone like foden because of all the other options that weve got and against southampton i dont think theres theres many better punts we know what hes capable of hes an absolutely like unbelievable worldclass player on his day and hes playing the worst team in the league i genuinely think they are the worst team in the league so go for it i think its its pretty safe matthew perry and die for wha or just play it safe with wood just go for wood just go for wood i think thats an easy one i think given what ive learned about the fixtures tonight im a bit worried about the oing wood and again i wouldnt dont think id be saying that at the start of the season whist is a fine pick but hes been injured we dont know g what were going to get we know exactly what were going to get for wood were going to get an attack who are basing their team around getting service so i think im afraid its a pretty boring answer for me in that and dr david 1963 agrees there you go sam v says bri play wolves already this year wasnt easy 31 dont know why everyones piling on 8 nory this week no i think you can wait a week on him i think people are piling on him because theyre getting rid of trent and gabrielle or cba and its not that obvious to nowhere to go if you looking for the medium to long term he has got the attacking threat who else you go for we talk about how theres a bit of a lack of options at four five like a mikeno like that you get in a nory hes probably going to concede against brian id be very surprised if we didnt score in that but i wouldnt be too surprised if he got an attacking return and then i think he is the best four fiveish option defender so i could i can see why people are going for that lets see if theres any more questions before i call it ab says about edison is killing me now cant keep clean yep you and praz both i think its hes not someone that ive ever wanted to own but then again i thought ray would do the job and he hasnt either so its its a bit of a shame and ill take one more question if the question is just from trigger hard rested for stones this week i hope not trig considering im expecting to play the triple captain on him mo says good sol at this bit of a strange one not had to do a the black box solo before not sure whats happening next week i think mark said he might not even be around next week as well which im sure will upset quite a few people might see if luk or andys around hopey andy wont have another delivery it was a bit last minute with mark because hopefully pip isnt listening but mark forgot until about 7 pm last night and was like my god i just realized its pips birthday so i hope i hope hes treated as something nice ive met pip and she she puts up a lot with that man bless him i love you mark right im going to call it there thank you all for sticking with me its amazing to know that weve stuck around 700 people watching even though ive been just chatting on my on my own sorry for the technical issues at the start hopefully the graphics were okay on this stream and ill be back next week with someone not toly sure who its going to be but ill definitely be back next week and good luck this game week if you are triple captaining harland i hope he goes absolutely mad for you and same if youve got foden too because they will be the deci side whether i come into next pretty happy or pretty miserable anyway thats it from me thank you and see you next week
