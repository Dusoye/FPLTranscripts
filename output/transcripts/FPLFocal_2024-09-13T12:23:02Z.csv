welcome back for another video final video before the deadline in this one were going to discuss all the biggest questions and dilemmas that youre facing for gami 4 and my final thoughts this week and we of course have got lots of press conferences today so were going to dig into some key news that you might have missed lets start with the je hawks who ask should we avoid shia pedro this gameing because of his international duties so whats hler had to say about this then well he said quote i think we have a great medical department who will do everything for the regeneration of the players also the players themselves theyre professional enough to know what they have to do to be fully recovered for saturday and he also said of course they cant train today with the team but they will be back on the training ground and then its about giving them a good recovery and hopefully they can train tomorrow and then of course theyll be part of the squad so my take on this quote is its overall positive essentially saying that the players know what they need to do to be fully recovered to play this weekend the other good news is sh pedra played a total of 45 minutes over the break which is nothing over a 2e period however there was a lot of traveling and he got back late coming back from south america he might only get one session before the game in my view hes still a perfectly fine player to buy however if youre going to wild card in gamei six in a couple of weeks you could go for well backck instead for the same prize who of course wasnt involved internationally over the break j pedro is generally the favored pick as hes played more minutes and he on penalties but for two weeks well backs a good punt as well ive pought jia pedro myself while were on the subject to bryson alex asks is now a good time to buy bryson defender based on recent form and upcoming fixtures and who should be buy well its definitely a good week to buy given theyve got two decent home fixtures ahead and for me its d call for bugam van hex should be nailed as well but dun is undoubtedly nailed herer implied that ver bran is his number one keeper now and hes not going to be rotating like we saw last season and occas missed it the only reason that he missed the first couple of game weeks was due to injury over the summer as stan and cadog are two on the watch list for me for later in the season they could both become great picks if they get regular minutes it seems like a matter of time until 4 and a half mil koc gets his first start roger asks whether the arsenal plans changed to ver gods injury so my personal plan at the moment is to keep sacka and then add havocs to my team in gameing six even without erard arsenal should be able to beat leicester and southampton pretty comfortably in gameing six and seven on fantasy football scout one of the many members features you get is team news and predicted lineups for all teams link below to join with a 40 discount so heres the arsenal predicted lineup which i do agree with hav has got a good chance of playing slightly deeper in midfield and the ear god role which reduces his appeal a little bit this doesnt put me off buy g 6 currently though and n god should be back around gami 7 if youre waiting up buying salah for sacka then ards injury might make that decision a bit easier but could backfire given sacas record against spurs if you have made that move already then you might take comfort in the ard injury in a way if you havent watched the experts video thatll be on screen at the end we did a deeper dive into arsenals record with and without erard and the team callum says rate the app out of 10 well ill give it a solid 10 in my unbiased opinion if youve not got it yet then you can join about 70000 people that use the website now which is crazy its out on by android and ios links down below to get its completely free with tons of useful fpl tools and weve got some class features that were working on so its only going to get better as well latic asks diaz or j for his liverpool triple up hes already got train and seller in his case this ones tricky to answer this week both for on international duty diaz played 180 minutes and he did score against peru and they did argentina as well which is about as tough as fix has come but they did beat them 21 josa played over the break as well including the full 19 their final match which was on sunday diaz played two days later and he did have more traveling so id just about give it to jot if i was picking one the last thing to mention is that darwins suspended from international duty so he didnt play at all over the break which makes it even closer as hes the main competition for j honestly flip a cor in this one but id go for j this charger 7 asks whether i think well be able to hold on for the elusive 5 free transfers and if so would you immediately use them from any wild card or would you use the wild card and keep them now in case you missed it this season onwards the wild card and the free hit no longer wipe your free transfers which does affect strategy now i would aim to have three or four maximum before wild carding cuz with a wild card the goal is generally not to immediately have booked in transfers so if you have a wild card thats well thought out theres every chance that you could roll twice and then youre up to five anyway i think very few are going to be able to roll up to five this season that said the top ranked team yet to make a transfer is fifth in the world but thats an anomaly definitely not going to be typical so i like the wild card with the extra ro transfers rather than spending them in wild card later theyre both pretty close though the other thing worth mentioning is this new rule kills the one big punts and fpl before wild carding now previously if you had two three transfers and youre about to wild card then you always take a one big punt on someone and then you take them back out if you need so thats another strategy change its less worth it now cuz you can carry those transfers over after the wild card hopefully i explained that well im not sure if i did question from daniel who asks is a downgrade from vardal to lewis a priority move given lewiss advanced role so far this season id argue its the opposite of a priority move although he has look fantastic hes much cheaper and he has to started three games hes got competition for that role and pep can quite easily change the system as well on a game by game basis where its walker or kja that could play there now ak was stretched off over the break as well and he could be out for a while so gavardo has got less competition now and in my view much better for expected minute so i wouldnt make this move alen lump asks if having free midfield is under 6 mil is sustainable is the only way to own harland salah palmer and tren well for this to work you need those sub six million midfielders to deliver or you need all your premiums to deliver and they simply w every week i managed to fit in harand sal palman robertson on the wild card video which is 1 mil less than having tr but even then that was with a view to selling salah to sackur and gamix six to free up a further 2 and a half mil or so it can definitely work but i think its too much money chucked into four players thats 45 a2 million of four players at the 100 mil budget from gami 6 anywhere a combination like having inom and havit should outscore palmer off salah and a super cheap forward a quick round up of some other news then from the press conferences callum wilsons behind where they wanted him to be so isaks minutes under absolutely no threat for the time being if he kept him not even an early substitution looking likely though were no very popular mood this week was isaak to jia pedro or wellber to help fun salah it was reported yesterday that harand trained with the squad but he will be allowed to take compassionate leave after the death of a close family friend so theres been a bit of concern that the most own player in the game could be a doubt for g for now hollands response on social media suggests that hes got no plans to take leave the same happened last season with a family member passing pep was asked about it in the press conference and he said quote it was a tough moment for him and his family and it was sad news are thoughts of with him and his family and well see tomorrow if hes mentally and physically able to play my personal feeling is he will play and theres no risk in captain in him hell either start or probably wont play at all so just be careful with vice captaincy as always jav ellit fractured his foot during the break and hes going to be out for the foreseeable future now the main player this probably have an impact in is obis who looks a bit better for minutes k has trained three or four times for li ball now hes probably the one thats likely to come on for sal than elliot would have been some man city news from pep who conf confir that both rodri and foden are back in training and available for selection fodens only 63 owned it could be a crazy differential from gami 7 when theyve got a run of furland wolves southampton bournemouth and brighton pep also stressed in the press conference that the first three gamei of preseason v and preseason is over in the sense that theyve no longer got midweek off and theyre going to have plenty of midweek games less time to recover and train and he alluded to rotation as well also saying that players wont be playing every match so whats the latest on sanki by the way how is he still not dropped in priz anyway poa cogle said salanki improved as well and he trained the back half of this week we still have two days to go with those guys so hopefully they get through the training okay and they are available he also said that vanen trained all the way through the international break and hes ready to play in the northland and derby thanks for watching and hit subscribe if this was helpful for weekly fb content like this to help guide you through the season well be live right here for a deadline stream tomorrow see you all
