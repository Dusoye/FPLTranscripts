welcome back for another video so gamei 9s just around the corner got a lot to digest this week and ive got some tracks and moves to consider with saaka currently flagged how did you all get on last gamei let us know in the comments well start off with a quick review of the gamei and then well have a look at some of your biggest highs and lows of last gamei followed up by my team selection and the transfer plans it was a pretty disappointing game m 31 points all out blanks from riya trent porro gabrielle ls boomo johnson salanki and haren captain in other words rogers and wood the two heroes that put up any points admittedly i got a bit lucky as well auto subs and rogers coming on for sacka i was somewhat surprised to see sacka not in the squad at all but perhaps a reminder to take everything artetta says with a huge pinch of soul a hot debate this week cuz wether some had some inside news on sackur as well and we held it well i kept sacka expecting him to start so i certainly had no idea i would have bought foden or palmer given ive got triple spars already i would say though sacka to some was a perfectly logical move regardless and i would be surprised if a small group was gatekeeping information the risk and getting courau theres too massive i rarely get sent early team leads myself personally and if i do ill just share it im not sure if many of you care about all that stuff but i thought id weigh in putting all that aside it was a hotly debated game with the sun assist given tweeted by official fpl then the tweet deleted and then sunday night followed up by another tweet saying theyd made a mistake and given it in the first place you think it was the correct decision or a mistake if you missed the sun goal it was a sun shot saved by arola and then it hit to debo then it hit arola again to take it back on target hence no assist i personally felt they got one that right and its good to note that they changed the rules this season so that points are now finalized on the final day of the game weag there could be other occasions this season where you get some goals or assist points given the next day which wasnt initially given had this been last season those points would have been locked in on saturday night despite a poor score im very happy with my team i cant fult the players ive picked and thats just how the game weeks go sometimes it wouldnt be surprising if a team that scores 20 or 30 or so points last game we goes on to get 70 the next game week thats often what happens lets have a look at your biggest highs and lows of the game as well next alex volo triple captain harland very unfortunate and hes photoshopped an l over the sea here to reflect how he shortly feels after that one six points a tale of two sides here adriana got keens 14 points at auto subed off her bench while tommy says my highest scoring player is second on the bench he didnt get so lucky another chip disaster fpl simpson says accidentally bench boosted two players of a combined value of 83m he says no idea how it happened but im in 100 pound ahead mini league he bench boosted mik leno and vanderberg for seven points on the bench could have been worse further chip disasters fpl dun says i had loads of yellow flags and doubts following the international break i free hit away from a team that had watkins rogers ss and salah i bought in cba who got minus three ryan gabriel rico lewis foden gordon johnson salanki who all pretty much blanked or worse finished on 21 points the old team would have had 42 points kareem sent his team and these are all brutal by the way theres a bit of a trend here he says no returns he got minus three from cba the only return is last on his bench when everton finally played good he finished on 19 points it was one of those gamei wasnt it im hoping the next game we get some great scores back in again did anyone have a good gamei well just a few sent some good ones in this week so well finish of yeti p he got 72 points and he had returns from sals ana salah captain son rogers and watkins and on top of that hes up to 148 in the world so thats that done lets get into my team for game9 and transfer plans in goal its ryer its pretty remarkable that hes kept no clean sheets home to leicester and southampton and their b away so im sorry to riot owners that had him before i think i broke him getting on the wild card for that run further to that its a horrendous fixture this week facing liverpool at the emirates cba suspended cury off injured with a possible knee injury in the champions league timber still injured and potentially out again so it could be a back line of something like zenko or kir or left back gabriel and white center back and party right back its just not worth spending a keeper transfer in my opinion here transfers are too precious and there are other changes in the team im looking to make which are more of a priority perhaps some good news for lewis owners walkers got a knee issue and hes not in the champions league squad so hes a doubt for the weekend again still not a guarantee of lewiss minutes of course pep could line up without lewis and walker if he wants to its the stand up fixure this week though playing at the sd head home to southampton man city comfortably top of the clean sheet probabilties with 52 chance next high is brighton 36 and then brenford 34 as it stands im playing trent over gabrielle this ones quite tight you either hedge your bets and go for both or you can go all in on arsenal and start double defense the injuries and the ca red nudges me trents way though i am considering a defender transfer this week which would see trent drop to the bench im keen to keep hold of trent though for those fishes after arsenal when hes got brighton home v home southampton away lastly pedro porro who took more shots than any defender in the league last season and his 16 shots this season is currently a more than anyone else four more than anyone gabriel and t have taken 12 par has taken 16 vard and diaz have taken 10 hes registered 177 expected goal of on so hes showing promise i just need him to chip in with an attacking return to help towards a rank swing upwards spurs play way to palace and theyve been given a 29 chance of a clean sheet this week its a 343 for gami 9 in midfield its sacka johnson boomer and rogers so lets talk about saaka first then what do we do with him hes been upgraded to an orange flag or downgraded 25 chance of playing oddly carsley indicated over the international break that he could have played in their second game which was well over a week ago now but he said it was unfair to risk him and aleta said he was hopeful hed make the bournemouth game what we do know is he wasnt in the champions league squad as arsenal beat sha to 1 nil so is he simply saving him for the liverpool game as it stands im looking to sell him roll that in the transfer plans later rogers was outstanding in the champions league midweek what a player he should be nowhere near the england under 21s i can understand emys frustration there when he gets cau up every time viller have enjoyed a great start to this season which he has played a part in theyre currently four five wins two draw one loss 293 expected g of for rogers for comparison suns on 296 j are just above on 306 its a home fixure this week as well as villa host bournemouth johnsons goal scoring streak finally coming to an end last game then a brutal watch as a triple spurs owner myself with none of my three picks involved in any of the four goals we had a golden chance header which was loed and he put a shot narrowly wide as well he created two chances against west ham and he took five shots in the box in total it does have the feeling of a potential breakout season for him and bumo gets the vice captaincy this week its a great looking fixure home to whip switch whove conceded 174 expected goals this season which ranks rock bottom in the league just behind southampton on 1725 xgc it was great to see vissa back in the squad as well after his injury we hadnt seen him since game four bumo managed to chip in returns in his absence but lets not forget what great partnership the two are v could be a serious differ for r to consider hes only 22 owned and hes 59 mil its hard to look past wood right now but v has got the better longer term fixtures onto the front three then which is wood sank and harland is this a week to consider triple captain in harland looking at the data man city projected 335 goals by the market which is the joint highest this season of all teams it switch at home was the other one where he course got hatrick against ip switch the other side of the coin though is this no rodri no kd b in the squad rodri wasnt involved when he got that first hat trick against i switch kd b was for game mc n man city going to have neither them in the team i do think its a valid week and i did say last week that we talk about it now and i saw this as the better week than the last one we did have a poor game against wolves though one of the worst games ive seen him play im going to think it over the rest of this week as it stands im saving it ordinarily this wouldnt be much of a conversation in previous seasons but as a reminder due to the fa cup schedule changes theres two expected double game weeks but weve got triple captain free hit bench boost and possibly the mystery chip to use in the double game week so thats four chips for two weeks possibly the free hit can work in the blank gamic as well hence you could make the case a triple captain in a fixture like man city home to southampton and use it in a single gamei its certainly work for those used in gameing 2 and even three id love to hear your thoughts on this one drop a comment below sh them what you think so harand tops the goal scor o with a 57 chance of scoring anytime soank is on 34 for the palace game if we filter the last five gameing since sanki returned from injury his underlying numbers been good 365 xgr which ranks fifth highest of all players and second highest among fors after jimnez himz was someone that we should have discussed in the players divide video hes got four goals and an assist in the last five and hes got great running games ahead hes taken the opportunity and run of it since coming into the team for mooners now harland alarmingly quite far down this list which going back to the triple captaincy debate its an argument that you can make against it three blanks in a row and recently not putting up the same numbers not the same shot frequency and so on one very tight decision im pleased with so far is wood over calon on the wild card that one underlines the luck element of fpl i felt there was very little between them and it bowled down to forest looking like a better side so far the season dc had the better overall fixtures and at least he does look slightly better than wood longterm for fixtures but wood in the better team potentially three more game maks in the team for wood and then ill shake things up moving on to the bench which is fabianski seeno gabriel and greaves so even if theres no concrete news on sacker i could roll regardless with seeno a pretty solid option to auto sub on if required ive got two free transfers and theres two paths on considering now the first path is just a roll or transfer and look to buy palmer gami 12 by crewing some free transfers until then option two is to bring palmer forward and buy him right now before newcastle home ive only got 4 mil on the bank though so a second free tr will be required to fund it so the second move im considering is gabriel to pinck that that frees up more than enough money and you might think why not someone like vardal that could end up being the best possible route to go but the big tradeoff there is i cant get sacker in around gamei 12 or 13 ill use plan fpl to show it easier here so this week if i was to buy palmer and pinck then i could roll in gamei 10 and 11 if all goes well this is how my team would look for those two game leagues and then in gamei 12 i could sell wood for stewart or only 4 and a half mil forward and then johnson to sacka and then trent back to gabrielle so ill be temporarily selling gabriel for liverpool new newcastle and chelsea gabber is 63 mil though so id lose a bit of team value in doing this what i dont like is id be playing it very tight here as well any other issues in the coming weeks and it be a minus 4 or i have to delay the moves till gamei 13 id like to do the moves in gamei 12 ideally though cuz wood plays against arsenal and johnson plays against man city then even if theres positive news on sacka its tempting to make the move regardless as hes not played for weeks now so whats this match fitness and sharpness going to look like let alone the move does get me an upgrade on p buying pal homes in newcastle as opposed to sacker against liverpool if you enjoyed this video make sure youre subscribing its completely free and drop the video like to show support thanks for watching and see you soon for the next one
