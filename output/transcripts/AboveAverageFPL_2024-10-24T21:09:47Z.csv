n right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam and as always joined by baker evening mate how you doing not too bad mate not too bad not too bad thursday night friday deadline not long to go i like friday deadlines it just feels like you can finish work get your team done and then you can just youre just out youre just out of it sday morning just so irritating and they like the 1230 stuff you just feel like you feel like youre just constantly thinking about it from about 9 to about 1100 whats going on whats going to happen i like it no control deadlines done relax its weird one though for me because on a on a saturday morning normally im taking the little one to dancing and so then i get half an hour to myself while shes there sitting in the car so i can flick onto a stream i can search twitter i can jump on discord chat with the patrons i can do all that stuff in that half hour and be just ready to go i give her a lift to gymnastics we turn up at about 5 to 11 and then its like right i got five more minutes she runs off and its like okay i can get any moves that i need to do done so i dont mind it i dont mind it personally but no i can get the appeal i can get the appeal of a of a friday deadline for sure theres not even a l lunch time kickoff is it saturday i have no idea mate i have no idea so switched off so its lester forest leester forest tomorrow night 800 and then next game is straight into it 300 loads of them well four of them not loads this the time im maybe im just not paying attention so much because im not thinking im going to do much this week spoiler alert i just dont think i just dont think im going to be doing loads spurs are on at the moment yep so weve timed this perfectly as always timed it perfectly brenon johnsons coming on for the second half just fyi couple of people in the stream said it was lagging a little bit but a few hours have refreshed and it seems like its okay good doesnt look like its lagging on my side no drop frames nothing like that so hopefully we should be okay so just refresh your stream if youre if it is doing that and hopefully we should be just good so hello to everyone in the youtube chat and there is a poll out it is the question of the week do you want to be triple captain in harland yes no or let us know if youve played it already let us know in the comments lets see what youre going to be doing and i can imagine so did you see earlier on when andy sent out a message sent out a tweet he was like im thinking about doing this thinking about doing this and just was talking about transfers and he already changed his triple captain was active on harand just sitting there in the image first 20 comments no one noticed first 20 comments no one noticed and and then somebody down bit further down picked it up i said i see that little white chip there i see it there sneaking in so if you want a if you want a yard stick on whether were going to be hitting 200 eo like andy mirs lets talk fpl if hes got it on its going to be high its going to be high i think its its going to be do i think itll be 230 240 something like that no i dont think it will be i think itll be like 210 maybe and that is quite interesting isnt it because quite a lot of people have played it already okay quite a lot quite a lot of people are going to play it normally you dont get this like some did it here some did it here some did it there like last season virtually everyone did it in the same place see someone i was chatting i was half chatting to someone on x last week i cant remember when i played mine i cant remember we played it game we 27 was it hland everyone did that game 27 hland i cant remember genuinely gen i cant remember but everyone did it like we remember the end of the season thing we did the sort analysis looked at all the different places to see who when did people play and everyone played in the same place okay thats true thats true a couple more people are saying that theyre having problems with the stream i am not sure why that is to be honest because as i say ive got this little thing that says dropped frames normally when the when the it lags and even crypto block dan saying it as well and he has the best internet in the world so this is very interesting lets see if i can lets see if i can press a few buttons if you lose you i apologize but i dont like it when you press a few buttons man i dont know i dont know what else im supposed to do mate to be honest lets see if we can f b justor did you do that did you press the button to make fan of b score no but thats not a bad thing is it theres enough people say work its fine i think we just i think we just we just crack on we just crack on okay well if you are managing to see the screen and you are enjoying the content that we do make sure you drop a like on the video bergell has just missed from two yards and taking the keeper out and if you like if you want to see more then make sure you subscribe and thanks to everyone in the chat for joining us and we can we can just go straight into the games lets go straight in the games mate lets get it done straight in the games we got to be short because its friday deadline so were limited time frames here so we are lot lets do it do it get out cool so standard graphic rob t just showing us the expected goals and percentage probability chances of clean sheets no surprises city stick out as the prime fixture in fact we were normally looking as you say before previously teams are looking to score over two goals and its pretty much there are a couple there but its city or bust feels like a city or bust week 335 expected goals with a 50 chance of a clean sheet and and southampton with the only team thats expected to score less than one goal or not expected to score a goal slam d fixture absolutely its a slam d picture is what it is i think brenford and brighton both on 2xg or more we ask are we starting to see are we starting to see three or four teams that we can look at every week when were looking at looking at picking teams to target like historically its been its been big four plus or big six like thats where you thats where you see it the big attacks but well weve seen brighton up there before weve seen brighton up there before definitely under desery a few times and but brighton with no striker no its surprising that is a little bit surprising well becks definitely not making it and j pedro not either dont know about ferguson after coming off early last week its im surprised im surprised about it and i dont think its rare that youll go into a week where youll have a team where thats got virtually no ownership in terms of the attack and theyve got an expected goals of 215 in a week georgino 55 hes is an interesting pick now on if you were on wild cart this week i think i think he genuinely is quite interesting probably hard to trust many of the others in that but is he interesting enough that youd pick him say over rogers continues to liver villa got 185 expected goals you probably have him would you have georginio over mcneel probably not probably not because the like the guarantee of minutes the guarantee of involvement set pieces at space id still think id like mcneil probably over georgino i think i think its a tough one brighton looking at this one is it makes you sway towards could i get anything there but just i just dont see theyre about to walk into liverpool and city i think its a its its a complete nondiscussion with everton who like fulham southampton west ham brenford compared to wolves leicester sorry wolves liverpool city i just think i just think those three fixtures those next two fixtures if it was on wild card i would just be i would be swerving brighton because just unless youve unless youve got transfers in the bank like if you got three or four transfers and youre on a wild card then cool go for a punt and use one to get out of it and you might go you might just go from one team to the other you just go from a brighton to a to a wolves maybe although there arent any real midfielders from wolves that you want to be fair a lot of people with at nori now very popular this week and and like hes going in as a defender against a team that were expected two goals against you wouldnt normally play defenders against a team thats expected two goals against so hes a stash and he definitely are you are you looking up because rardon has scored i didnt know he scored hes just about to take the penalty but thanks ah that was a penalty was it he just staring down ive got notification im not watching it i got notification hes staring it down jcs brought up an interesting an interesting point and we will discuss that later on we have got a we have got a graphic for for a free hit n team because it is is an option particularly if youve got you if youre low on brighton the difficulty is as weve said with brighton is that they dont have any strikers so that you could go you could go boma georgino and then what 30y at the back i think i think so well look at that free hit in a minute but i think ill put rogers in on that free hit team and i think bear in mind giorginos probably got pens as well this weekend ill probably go georgino over rogers but then again i told you last week to go e over rogers and watch the scores so thats thats the difficulty when its a its a relatively good game for them this i think is people will be looking at watkins and potentially again still thinking do i sell him do i do because of the other shiny toys you might want to get the foden the palmer all those type of players but 185 has a massive share of the goals watkins is still fantastic in my opinion this week brenford if you after cheap striker this week so like chris wood we have a chance to talk about chris wood cuz he scored monday night you could look at it and say whiss back good fixtures long good fixtures we dont know we dont know hes back though right hes at a half hour which is fine were not talking about a son palmer saaka type job where you where you take you take the risk because how important they are to the team and that they can have an immediate impact because of the individual quality of the player now im not saying whis is not a good player i think hes a good player but hes not a great player no that said i think say i use the pun for you i think brenford will farm big chances they will against the old tractor boys and so hes going to be hes going to be one thats going to be a huge beneficiary of that bumo as well it was weird i had a discussion with someone on x earlier they just sent me a little dm asking me a few like questions which nobody ever does so i was like well okay and he was like would you sell dcl for wha and i said no on that one just because i think that i just think that everton will continue to generate good chances over the next three or four weeks and i just think that transfer might be better used elsewhere on a pivot and gw 12 type vibe so again one week punt maybe well one week punt definitely if youre on free hit i would have him but i dont think i think id be comfortable enough just having bumo in that fixture i just think but just go back to these cheap strikers i think weve all danced around chriswood most of us have not everyone because more than 10 of the game had him the other night when he scored like its a long time now i think they pulled up pulled up like last 38 games like that last 38 games like a calendar season as it were and only palmer and harlem more goals in him which is insane what are we mocking about like why isnt isnt wood just set and forget leave him there thanks i agree is this the right it sounds like it should be the right entry point but is a is a way derby the right entry point i dont probably not like were all going to keep saying is it worth it but its probably just some reflections for us is like when it came to wild card you went and ker i went dcl we were looking for stuff when the thing that we continually talk about is nuno loves him where weve had this bit where we were like were not sure if we love him and maybe we like taio better and all this stuff but the fact is the manager absolutely loves him hasnt stopped picking him up for a year hes just hes just a good ive been ive been hot on him since 2019 mate and i still cant pick ive dont think ive ever still cant pick him its stupid its it doesnt it doesnt make a huge even when he was at burnley i was like ill go ashley barnes over him and things like that its its weird like when the opportunity is there i think is at some point is well make that move the entry point as i say we talk about entry point like if you dont get this fixture like you want probably four fixtures to be honest you want four or five fixtures out of it and if you lose the promoted side one its like well its just a little bit worse now because instead of the next five to west ham we just saw what west ham did i know im just thinking like instead of being in instead of being leicester as the entry point and the next five fixtures ending in ips your entry point is west ham and it ends with city and youre like well thats stupid isnt it and then doesnt make sense doesnt make sense its its now its now or its never but what well do is well go were not going to do it then because then hes got like a way to arsenal but then hes home to i switch i dont think i can get to him anyway i dont think i can reasonably get to him without a hit thats the thing if i could move xia pedro to him i would just do it well always find reasons well always find reasons to him but just some positive positives for him other than that this week spurs good fixture all looks of things 19 i think its interesting how the bookies have are now seeing arsenal liverpool if you looked at last year a klo game in this one like 28 expected goals between the two teams is low you virtually got the same expected goals in everton fulham as you do in arsenal liverpool thats quite interesting theres only theres only leicester forest and everton fulham they have lower expected goals than arsal liverpool this weekend thats going to be down to thats as you say like its not a its a klo thing theyre a lot more conser not conservative they a lot more controlled in buildup arent they liverpool and they havent and they havent been they arent going to put theyre not going to do it to arsenal but they arent they dont look like theyre going to score three or four goals in a game well they look like it liverpool looked like if they went two and0 up they just wouldnt let they just they just shut up shot completely completely i think i think its i think its still a good fixture for the defenders i do like its its not a disastrous fixture feels ki i wouldnt be surprised if it walked away a n youd also wouldnt be surprised if it finished one all or 21 either so its not its not probably its not probably a 20o game for the defenders either no saying that is gabrielle got the 15p pointer against tottenham like those set pieces set pieces could be big for tren and gab its its just a just a toughy one we werent planning on talking about tottenham but im going to blame that dom in the chat said is will madison play well hes looking around now i dont think hes on the pitch now i think he its very interesting that he started tonight and not saw that was something i wasnt well i didnt know how much andrew was going to rotate tonight i know we had the we know about son i dont think theres any worries about son whatsoever not in plans for the game and sess that doesnt doesnt scream like theres an issue just screams like im just managing minutes but it does look like hes been taken off at half time unless no teo went off at half time madison on the pitch and n other moves made so far 60 minutes in so i think thats a worry for madison i think that is a worry is they they quite often will play three in the middle and all that stuff and i just i do wonder if from that last game the sar basuma and keski midfield maybe just thinks its more solid maybe as an away game definitely be i definitely be a little anxious if i was a madison owner i dont know this is this is a home game and you only 45 minutes maybe he just needs to get more minutes in his legs like would we be bothered would we be bothered about him if hed have played 85 minutes and then played 30 minutes today i dont think i be he did get taken off at half time for tactical reasons thats but i said i said at the weekend thats specific to the way the game was going now if he thinks that were going to have the same problem against palace i dont know its its definitely not good though is it no theres no theres no way we spin it in this is a good thing no thats fine so its its its definitely a problem and if somehow madison doesnt play then its good for parro its great par other ones on this man united look good chelsea look good look good we better just look at the main man then man city so we know theres no doku this weekend we know theres no greish this weekend i think the one thing is thats definitely its definitely a bump for har of minutes and its definitely a bump for photom minut it isnt it what choice they got sounds like f and left well the only thing is i dont know will play fod and left or play left and then bernardo right play bernardo right yesterday second half he played monas nunes on the left there is also that and he was good didnt just play on the left he was good on the left would so wouldnt surprise me if he played all of those he just said there is and foden stays central i think i think he just i think it just it does feel like end of the last season he was just bins now central player and i think i do think that will continue i think the reason why i bought toinho is and his plan doku and all those things is that he just doesnt see boden as that as that wide man anymore so i do think i do think hell still play central but it could be sininho and bernardo feels like probably what it is and then what kovic and bernardo in the middle i dont think theyre going to need much defensive no defensive defensive work doing at the weekend i can imagine that past map is going to look very interesting i do good for good for v well i think if nunes is there im not sure it is as good im not sure it is as good for vardal but hey maybe he doesnt need to because he bangs him in from 20 yards anyway so if he passes to him because if he always goes out on the outside then maybe not maybe not v ill just find ways of scoring true it is it is it is what it is and they have 50 chance for clean like viio should be a good pick the question is you do you do you want to spend six million on vardal if you havent got him a lot of money is its a lot of money i do think so trent to vario for example i do think just liverpool are miles better defensively theyre miles better defensively theyre incredible defensively im not sure im not sure id save that million quid would you back would you the fixtures i wouldnt back the fixtures though over the next few i know they get i back this fixture but post this fixture id back liverpools fixtures theyve got brighton liw brighton and then they got they got two home both at home theyre both at home but its still brighton and villa i if you ask me brighton and villa at home or bourma from brighton away from man city if you ask me to take the bet well have that bet all day long mate ill take you any day any day of the week this is man city one clean sheet since game week one absolutely diabolical defensively two away games i dont think theyre good cleans liverpool just went out to lipick and cleaned like theyre cleaning everybody okay they give one chance up to liverpool to chelsea ar arsenal theyre away to arsenal expected 15 goals like these are these are a good defense i dont i wouldnt like a trent to valar move thats thats for me i think you have to i just think youd have to have not side about five transfers in the bank it depends on what youre going to do with a million quid i dont know i dont know how much how much you can improve your sigh with a million quid though in midfield or attack and thats the point thats why i dont think its worth it because i dont think youre getting enough bang for your buck with that extra million quid thats why thats why i think if youre going to get off you just you just jump fair enough hence thats what ive done captaincy triple cap to captaincy harland do you think thats an absolute nobrainer or could you see yourself going elsewhere do you look at the goal projections lets have a look at the go protections so harand projected 136 i think for reference when he played it switch it was 135 so the same palmer 65 is next so hes expected to score at least one more goal or dble sorry not at least one more goal hes expected to score double of any other player in the league this week so captaincy a lock triple captaincy an option it is he scores ridiculous goal in the mid last night and if we look at the times so this is the third time this season that hes had expected goals or projected goals we to say of more than one against brenford grace against ipswitch hatrick it effing suggests youre going to get 13 points minimum if you do triple captain him and its 13 points its a clear 13 point points on the field yes thats huge i expect models will have him somewhere like nines early nines like that as a prediction but either way its going to be a good clean amount of points against the field its its a i couldnt put anyone off it that was trying choosing to do it im just goingon to personally is im although its been pretty much a disaster of season so far i dont i still feel like id like to hold on to it thats thats just how i feel with it i think this season more than any season like bonus points reward the attacker i like that if i can have two games if i can have a talisman in two games and preferably a midfield talisman in two games i just think its it gives me just a fantastic opportunity from the bonus perspective realistically i dont value the chip that highly anyway like its one time this player isnt it thats what it is how many times how many points do you think that player is gonna get in a week and you get that extra that is that is what it is but definitely would put it on off it for me im id i just want to hold on to it and if you didnt have harland you just kept who if you didnt have harland because theres people dont have harland that wont be free hitting to get him in i think i prefer the i think i prefer the boomo pick because i think if you havent got holland youve definitely got boomo everyone loads of people have got boomo i think thats the fun thats the fun pick this week i definitely i like i would go boomer over palmer as c to b cool were in agreement there were in agreement i do wonder if those odds just seeing this world back currently projected 58 i think once bookies maybe realize that hes definitely not playing i wonder how much whether that does have a big old dent in the in the projected goals for brighton on that those data we saw true but other than that look watkins jackson wood still here ahead of son as well wood is ahead of son wood is ahead of salanki wood is ahead of esack and wood is ahead of the striker thats probably going to be playing against ip witch which is i a bit i feel a bit stupid on the wood thing on the thing it is what it is mate it is what it is jc saying triple captain chris wood maybe thats the way maybe that is the way do you want look at team lets go look at it okay so i got move off the bench now i for who though g rogers rers okay fair enough so youd have wood over whis in this in this week yes said that i know it just said that but i you just said i dont know hes but i would i know but i would i know i would still take that free hit you want the friday night game youre free hit you want the friday night game id still take that punt i would back myself over the bookies in that sorry k got double defense mate just get van no mate these guys are scoring for fun just go full triple brighton at the back anyway free hit team veran in goal p collins and dunk at the back bumo foden gundan palmer in midfield rogers is on screen not for long watkins wood and harland up top yes rogers fabianski mikeno and justin on the bench its its its a good way if you havent got harland i wouldnt break my team up to har id free hit this week its a fun week to do it i still probably would prefer well ian maybe im talking from a position where ive already triple captained i think i much now that i ive locked ive locked a chip away i would probably be looking to wait for a double for my free hit and so if you didnt free hit would you would you just take the gamble on bumo as opposed to breaking up the team get harded i just captain him bumo i just captain bumo i cant ging anyway on the harland thing are cu because youre going to get him into captains it but youre not gain on it because it give be 200 anyway no youre not going to gain on it but youre not goingon to youre gna avoid losing on it right youre going to avoid losing youre going to youre going to avoid losing on it people say like you dont gain anything well yes i do i gain harland thats what i get i get i get the harland points whereas i would have done before but we have just looked here and said getting 13 points so imagine is owner you dont own youre 26 points down on the field when have you ever looked at fpl optimized and been minus 26 and gone i can recover from this like you dont youre just youre weeks dead your weak is dead i would i would gondo is won for me hes taking set pieces he just is a bully in these games weve seen him do it internationally weve seen him do it for city he just hang around in the box he just hang around in the box and he just always scores in these games and hes owned you would not be i would genuinely not be surprised if hes sc a hat trick this weekend he be straight in for me over aario because i think youve got a good opportunity i would i still like pinck and collins because they setpiece threat is so big ips which you got no greaves they got no twan a you just got to go at it just got to go at it i would i that for me it would those are the players i would definitely go for you can walk around whether its wood whether its wi whether its rogers whether its georgino all of those type of ones but i think its i think its great i was tempted if a couple of people i was looking at this i was tempted with gacho over rogers was definitely one i looked at but again theres nothing wrong with rogers like i know its good youre going to look at it but technically still villa expected to score more goals than man united this week they didnt play thursday night man united are playing thursday night i like i do like but just like about probably just realizing the friday night games leer farest ill probably go ill probably go would i like nao for the next five weeks as well like hes a good pick for the next five weeks he was cheap legitim legitimately i was thinking about him this week i still am to be honest agreed agreed he hasnt done anything tonight i assume done absolutely nothing tonight dont know but the good thing is about him is last season he got ridden as a 90minut man and the last four games hes played 90 minutes so as soon as ten hog says youre my boy and youre playing again every minute a play time hes hes still on the pitch hes still on the pitch at the moment one shot hes hes got stamina for days js asking us wheres bruno couldnt afford it couldnt afford it because because the watkins thing youd have to lose watkins lose watkins get bruno get v no not going to that am i why would you on a fre walkins home to bournemouth you could have you could have bruno you have bruno at home to southampton and bner already sent off and id still have watkins bought home to bournemouth over bruno okay i wouldnt id have bruno br way at west ham over no home you said home to southampton with bner sent off slight go post slight exaggeration but like when once you start looking at once you put f and pal watkins and harland team you aint got a lot of money thats true that is true okay you money right onto our teams youve made some youve pushed some buttons mate so ill push him bs the other night y i got bit tri trigger happy tell world i put i put 4 in the bank because i dont know how much you got in the bank how much do you have in the bank i think 3 3 in the bank but i love it j it you im never leaving that cant do it no chance i was supposed to ask you before we started but we got were a bit too late carry on so so ive just spent the whole thing talking about how good defensively look for art and how you should play them i saw tren and absolut absolutely hate it thats thats how it works in it content creators thats what we do is we tell people not to do something and then we do something else yes thats about yes thats exactly how it works but ultimately d was my problem and i want palmer and i just want palmer and son more than anything just want them in my team want to see them in my team and the only way i could do it was to sell trent so i did thats thats it there isnt much than that ive sold him ive got ai i put a on the bench he on my bench i play meleno ill play gabrielle play lewis and hope for the best again why played 90 minutes i like it so its ry louis meleno gabrielle and defense sun palmer rogers brumo and then salanki har dcl up top every everyone at home apart from spurs so i know its its good its good i like it a lot its good its good it feels a very weird position as soon as youve got havent got two transfers again jc says you could have bought bruno fernandez i could have and genuinely was tempted genuinely was tempted so if i was to have just saw diaz it would have been to a man united player whether it would have been down to garnacho or up to bruno but bruno was one i was looking at okay so for the first time bruno was not banned from the transfers for me i dont think hes a bad buy at all you say youre saying youre evolving as a manager im saying that man united look like they were evolving last weekend which is a positive tough place to go fibach here as well so i wouldnt i wouldnt wouldnt lay too much into this plus no bruno no this week as well so cool good what would i do what would i do and what would you do if if it turns out suns not okay id probably just play eight nori fair off i say that while youve got seeno as your first in fact no id probably just play seeno id play seeno i probably just play seeno cool i have one free transfer i have3 in the bank myself my team currently sits as martinez porro gabrielle lewis and trent rogers bumo mcneil son and then harland and salanki up top ive got johnson jeia pedro leaf davis and e the more i look at leaf davis the more i cant believe i just didnt save an extra half a million then i wouldnt be get annoy myself that im short of money in a number of places so thats a bit annoying i contemplating moving on going like ges rather than leave davis just what any 40 defender anyone vandenberg this week would be lovely wouldnt it like imagine if i just had him just so i could get him in instead of a trent or a gabrielle and then i wouldnt have to think about making the transfer i could just park trent on my bench or park gabrielle on my bench and just be happy with it but no ive got leaf davis so i have again we have to keep talking about a like he cant hes just going to sit there f on the bench at the moment mate im trying to get him out of my team im just trying to get him out of my team the further i can put him on the bench the closer he is to going out of my team is he first on the bench no hes not im considering playing xia pedro just in case hes fit and thats not even bench wanker thats like i would i would take i quite like it id take half hour xia pedro at home to wolves to avoid probably hedging in that liverpool arsenal fixture because i hate hedging and i hate playing team playing things against each other youre not hedging it could be nil it could be nil thats true thats true its not it youre right its not its not a true hedge in that sense no nil a very possible result but so a ive toy with a down to down to nacho and then jaia pedro up because down to nacho gives me like seven and then jaia pedro i can get up to wood can i get up to wood i cant think cant still not gonna happen were never bringing chriswood team i cant i cant remember i was looking at it earlier now i cant now i cant remember what i was going to be doing this is very lson kona stran larson was definitely on the radar but in terms of in terms of this week i dont know jc saying e barry my boy like palace are just terrible theyre just a terrible team at the moment theyre just theyre just in a place where they are just bad and i know es had some chances but hes he just been bad whistle was the one i was looking at no wher was the one i was so xiao pedro to wher i think i can just do it its its its cu is playing tottenham so if you ever need a team to sort you out when when its not going so well then well find a way to help him out so you just know hes scoring im point too short thats right im point too short im point too short of wha so i was looking at e to gacho and then but then thats for a hit and its like whats the point in taking a hit when i could just roll and have a perfectly good team and an extra transfer next week theyre a big problem palace they are a big problem like the other night against forest would just com in my opinion comfortly the better team and mainly it was because it was everything was just i think feels snatchy in the team like and keo all his shots were quite snatchy as a the number of times its like block like shots are blocked all the time like theyre taking plenty of shots but the lack of quality is just constant because it feels desperate it feels lack of identity its its such a weird world where youve got a proper number nine target man we spent all season last season talking about how he is a full matto is a proper bully number nine you cant go from that style to a style with antia like hes not that he relies on a good build up team around him to create and then hes that fox in the box type guy or hes one where hell drop a little bit and try and bang it with his left like but hes hes not just havent they havent brought they havent brought anyone in they almost like and cats and cs almost replaced e in terms of like het in terms of the head there but he needs almost replaced i sorry alisa is what i meant but hes more like iou isnt he they be like i do what than that the its and ker and isar for alis and a is like similar profiles but not as good but a long way alis is completely different well smar isnt too disimilar to alis in style hes a one v one winger but hes id say that alises okay fair enough id say alis is more technical has definitely much higher technical ability whereas isar is very direct like run past the player rather than rather than team the to when suns out we play to verer who just runs past the player thats l thats what im saying is that theyve tried to do similar profile to similar profile but with much worse players youre like that doesnt work that never works but they to not play mata just i dont get it there must be a massive falling out so do you think still going on from the olympics when he said like i want to go to the olympics so i cant start the season with you guys bas its all its all bad its all bad its all bad so i think im probably going to roll im almost certainly not going to be playing e and the spurs thing as well ive got a spurs defender theres all sorts of reasons that i can put into my head that wont make me play aa so and if you were to sell a it would be what probably got an ao something like that as it stands i dont think theres anyone better the only way the only way i would improve a is if i sell trent its the only way i can improve him and you better just wait on that for a week but then i wont sell trent next week thats the thing as you said like the back end and dont and then you wont sell trent me so but thats okay thats okay not selling him next week is it definitely id wait a week so any questions anyone just drop them in the chat we 46 minutes thats not bad for us its good thats not bad its not bad peter red card were done pretty much d says r gimenez has been hes been excellent and vi is getting better vict is getting better five in five returns in five everton brenford palace wolves tough victory away at spurs i would say that home then arsenal liverpool so its good for the next four having southampton at home after arsenal and liverpool and then away to chelsea after just stinks of like youre not having him youre not having youre not getting him for southampton at home well you might if you bench him the problem is youve got such a good amount of depth in your in your team i still just look at it and think i just hold on to j pedro and hope that hes back for 12 thats what im thats what im hoping and waiting another week gets you closer to knowing that cuz dont get by the time we get to 12 you also got international break in that so you got quite a bit of time 12 is a 12 is a pivot spot as well and like i said already like i want jackson and palmer in 12 i like i want both of those players in 12 so i will probably make moves that help me get to that position i think b surv theres a theres a perfectly theres a perfectly reasonable exit point on son in 12 which is which is fine so palmers relatively straightforward salanki can be if he continues to flatter to deceive in terms of shot volumes then hell be easy to move on to be honest and id probably rather could you i can move back into the midfield somewhere if i want more of the spurs attack because like dei still like 62 as well and he will play other games dont forget on a as well like i dont think you can lose on a this week because he plays tottenham either we fix him because we fix everybody and hes back on show and then hes got walls away and fulham two good pictures if they get rolled over i see absolutely no way that glas is in a job next week true and then and then we saw what happened well we saw exactly its exact hes first on the new manager bounce job like he was the second huton g was like new manager bounce i love that stuff so regardless like hes probably a good pick next week questions who would you play at a meleno in esr play against each other as well ill play meleno play meleno probably just my throw my throw my mikeno bias in there as well i think spurs are about to get another penalty j asks is richie a threat to sanki minutes long term possibly but possibly a threat to some minutes too because i also id rather have richie play come on the left wi you than teo at the moment i dont think i dont think like richie is a different player to the way sank is playing at the moment as well very i dont i dont think he can feel that role would you walk call to bring salah in next week chs asked whats going to the question and he asked it a second time as well would i wild card to get s in next week i dont have an issue with it i do still think that game week 12 like you said is theres some good swings in that in that game week 12 it would probably be that weak for me id almost be tempted to make the move but id be more tempted to take harland out and bring salah in next week and then world c potentially go week 12 and do something else then would you possibly even later than that would you rather downgrade watkins or salanki to three up funds for a midfield upgrade well its more funds you release if you do sanki but watkins sorry if you do watkins so but you can still get down to you can still get down as you say to like strand lson and whatever else and that frees you up two million how high are you going up with your its its a difficult its difficult its difficult what i do think is mallison potentially is a bump to salanki minutes not a detriment to sanky minutes because prior to this week sank had to play every single game yes but now he doesnt have to play every single game so that there might be a world where hes beneficial to his minutes and that he starts playing 90 every league game because he doesnt need to play 0 in midweek we just dont know that yet so im concerned about salanki the last couple of games of no shot whatsoever and the way it feels like hes doing a load of the good creative work to it but palace is a good fixture home to villa is a good fixture home to ellip switch is a very good fixture would you start mikeno or gabrielle i start meleno i personally so before i made the trent move i had gabrielle in over above meleno but i hadnt i hadnt given any consideration id probably still give id probably still play gabrielle have i tried the fireable whiskey sour yet no i havent a whiskey sour apparently we have to love a whiskey sour sorry i love a whiskey sour you need to try the fireable whiskey sour apparently then i think jimmy i think jimmy sent it to me i think jimmy sent me like a recipe thing on on twitter so see could do a fire whiskey s on sunday night hgi says just joined are you two triple captaining i am not because i played mine in game week two and got a hattrick nice touche from harland so im im good and im not youre not so the big thumbnail triple captain harland we are not still think still think its good still think its a good week to do it though i do i do i think its i think its a better way and not necessarily because he scored a couple of goals in midweek but more because dku is out i think thats just a natural bump is theres no doku messing it up but and therefore i just think youve got guaranteed 90 minutes fair enough last couple go down go down to roberto whos fpl yellow army so da a first ask free active free hit active would you go son or foden this week free hit f him this week okay cool bench one of dcl or seeno bench s menu y i am you are yes you are and then ask would you start trent or gabrielle i would start the home defender i real okay cool jc says nice flex yes
