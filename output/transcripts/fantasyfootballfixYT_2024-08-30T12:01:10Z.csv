hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fakes youtube channel my names fpl phillips and its that time later in the week where ive got an episode of eddie versus the algorithm for yourselves where im doing quite well at the start of this 2425 season at risk of jinxing it if you dont know im taking on a computer generated team thats putting together its own free hit draft if you will or highest predicted point scoring side for each game we of the season and then putting together my own draft free hit were putting them up against each other for game we after game week until all 38 weeks have been completed and seeing which comes out superior myself or a machine or computer so far its 2n to myself ive done pretty well in gw one scoring 90 plus points the algorithm pretty close behind on 80s something and then last game week we both had haring captain but it was my pick with son in the end that did end up pretty much doing most of the damage so i was happy with that one not a pick i was seeing getting much love when i decided to go with him things changed when salanki was ruled out etc but overall i was still confident in son as a selection and so yeah im just to my own hall there really but i think i did pretty well and ive done quite well so far lets hope it continues as we move into game week three weve got an algorithm team to look at weve got my side to look at and then well discuss the captaincy as well which is going to be a big thing this week and just depend a little bit on who you own but im going to rank four of the top options in my preferred order for you so stay tuned for that one but firstly lets get into to having a look at the algorithm side so the lovely updated score is at the bottom of your screen 20 to myself the algorithm is predicted 61 points for this game week and to try and achieve the score its putting out this side in goal its going to be mark fleen of brenford as brenford have a very kind fixture against southampton at home who are probably the least impressive side of the 20 that ive seen and watched play so far this year i think it which have looked actually okay and i just in general think south h to look a bit lackluster going forward especially in game week two anyway game week one a bit of an anomaly fixture youre not going to get that often where your opponents go down to 10 men very early on in the fixture so its very hard to judge when youve got an even smaller than two gw sample size essentially with a team and maybe they just havent been able to find their gear and get into their groove yet but i think southampton away from home are pretty poor side are going to be a poor side and having southampton at home as a fix is going to be a good opportunity to try and target for some clean sheets now granted brenford havent looked amazingly solid defensively theyre not that high up in clean sheet odds there will be other teams that the bookies for etc are targeting but a 45 mil keeper if the algorithms looking to save budget to go big elsewhere in the side then i dont mind it as a pick where i would sl the question things slightly though is going with a double up with christian a coming in for that spot in the middle of the defense there so he started on the left and side with rico henry out at the start of this season hasnt looked that attacking from what im concerned ill admit i dont know hes in the line numbers but im not too interested in him as an option brenford have a bit of a mixed bag of fixtures coming up i think that if youre going with a player around the 45 46m mark then you go for robinson the player on the right of a on your screen there f have some very nice fixures coming up hes had a bit of a price rise so he might be out of budget for some people but if thats the case there are other 45s melo at na and forest who i think looks good and nailed on or you could even go for n delovic at 40m aston villa and have a good option there for a month or so however long matty cash is out for because he looks to be the preferred right back option for this year when cash hasnt played so yeah thats my two cents on a anyway ben white is another interesting one as everyones going to be opting really for reyya civa or gabrielle it seems from these first two game weeks ben white hasnt really been doing what we saw from him at points last season getting forward lows getting assist chances all that stuff so hes not really going to warrant 65m price tag and i feared that would be the case when i saw the pricing at the start of this season and i think as boring as it is rea just probably is the option to go for at the moment arsenal almost havent looked as amazingly solid as they have last season but theyre still managing to keep clean sheets if its only that those one or two big chances per game then reya is a worldclass keeper and he can keep them out so going for him and having that chance of getting the clean sheet still getting those saves in hes mopping up a lot of the bonus points is what weve seen over the first two fixtures as well so for 55m i think he offers pretty good value for an option into the arsenal defense so yeah ben white not much love for me but as a one punt in a free hit team essentially i dont mind it at all brighton at home is the best clean sheet odds of all with 50 chance i think it was which did surprise me a bit but i think the bookies know what theyre talking about and thats why a lot of fpl managers put a bit of faith in their statistics into midfield then were going to see a midfield four of embo sacka gordon and morgan gibbs white which i really the look of i have to say ando in particular i think could be a great pun for anyone whos thinking about wild carding next week or even bringing in as an option and then maybe benching in one of the two fixures afterwards which look a bit more tough hes got man city i think the week after so its not the most optimal time to jump on brian and buo but for this fixture he could be a great differential i think he started this game week at around 5 ownership so i dont think hes going to be anywhere near six or seven by the deadline so you could have a big differential on your hands if you want to go there as an inu replacement with a little bit of money in the bank i have to admit though i really some other options at that price so it obviously stops you going for someone an e who i think points are definitely going to come for maybe even this game week morgan rogers youve got smith row youve got lots of options including morgan gibbs white whos in this team as well for in kungu replacements that maybe have two or three good fixtures coming up instead of just the one on that note gibs white has stood out as the nottingham forest pick of choice really when i think well be coming in for wood its only a matter of time really with how u age is clearly getting to him up front and he doesnt offer the same skill profile that al and i offers with the pace and the strength instead of just physicality and finishing but chriswood will be it no disrespect to him has had his time and has been shown to be a quality player hes got a hat trick at newcastle last season but yeah gives white on penalties nailed on gna get the minutes i think he could definitely be the man for you hes hes again a little bit an in nailed on the talis man of the team the 90minut guy on pens but for me people will just see them as boring picks when they could definitely come through for you and gibbs white has some nice finishes coming up as well and definitely is one that ive considered very strongly is an unun replacement myself saka and gordon are then ones that people already have in their team so sacka good home fixture definitely captain the option as well which well get into and then anthony gordon is an interesting one you could had some good times against spurs at home and anthony gordon is known to be one of those players whos better at home although he scored away from home last game week its a bit one of those myths thats brown out of proportion amongst the fpl community but if youre backing him and you believe in that then home fixture against tottenham could actually be a pretty decent chance although for i think tottenham have been improved defensively this year maybe they havent had to face as many chances and again its a small sample size over two game weeks but for me im not sure its going to be quite the six whatever battering it was last season or the year before and then finally up front were going to have a look at the forward line so eac comes in so even more of an indication the algorithm is predicting a decent newcastle performance in that one we then got havs as well to complete an arsenal triple up and erling allen whos taking the captains arm band away from home against west ham so again theres not too much to mention here i really the look of all these three guys for this game week i think theres good options theres good options elsewhere as well habits is probably the one that the fewest people own and the fewest people are looking to getting he had a bit of a quiet outing against aston villa but he was very impressive in game we one and recency bias is 100 a thing in fbl managers weve got object permanence where we really whats in front of us at the moment and whats done well recently but even one week ago or two weeks ago now seems a bit far away for us but i think habits is a very good selection if youre looking maybe to replace isak or youre looking youve got those funds from downgrading in defense or in midfield youve kungu and rogers and youve got a bit of funds lying about then havit is an option you should definitely be considering trying to squeeze into your team or maybe on a wild card in future weeks finally then on the bench were going to see rogers johnson and howard bellis so some very template bench players but its good to see rogers getting in there as someone who has brought him in for in kungu but yeah lets have a look at my side now and see how it compares to this one so this is the side i have gone with a pretty controversial team but i didnt want to go with something that would be similar to what i was going to get from the algorithm i made this before i saw the algorithm team but ive gone with picks that i am backing quite a lot for this week and i feel very happy looking at it ive gone all in on a defense which is something i tend to do in this series sometimes ive gone with the arsenal backline soa gabrielle and rea are all in my team just going with clean sheet odds based on that one was tempted to do it with man city and just go with the pair of edison and rico lewis or somethingone that and back them away at home against west ham but in general i just got a bit of a feeling that arsenal might somehow scrape a clean sheet in that one but brightons attack has looked very good so i am a little bit worried there you got matoma whos been performing very well back in j pedro and then youve got m on the right hand side it is an attack that scare me slightly and i think theyll score a lot of goals this season so im not feeling 100 confident in that selection for a clean sheet but you living you can always get some decent bonus points and safe points now it seems from rare and then the defenders attacking set pieces brighton arent very poor from them in defense admittedly but you never know with c and gabrielle theyve been shown from those rice corners to get a lot of headed goals so maybe this will be the first game of the season that we see one im trying to manifest it here if you cant tell ive stuck with robinson ive also had embo in there had the same thoughts of the algorithm same with gibbs white too but then in my other two midfield slots ive not gone with saka or gon any of those boring picks ive gone with e and ive gone with cole palmer cold palmer on fire last game week i think its going to happen again admittedly at home crystal palace in game week two someone with double crystal palace defense in my actual side i am terrified and ive got the captain z and on palmer i think theres some serious points coming for him over the next few game weeks and its very difficult for me at the moment not being able to squeeze him into my team without a serious hit or wild card and ill be lying if i said ive not considered the wild card this game week with part of that due to review to try and get coa into my team and then im also quite excited by the forward line munise is quite a basic pick but one who is going to deliver on that xg and the chances hes been getting last game week very unlucky for owners a player again who i wish i owned up front and id brought in for salanki instead of the man i went with armstrong who looks a bit rubbish and then evan olson who if i still had salanki and id benched him last game week and i was now looking to get rid is maybe the pick id go for the bournemouth fixtures are a mixed bag granted hes got two quite tough games coming up after this one but bournemouth have been one of the most impressive sides to me so far i think theyve replaced salanki well with this fell i hadnt seen any of him before he came to the premier league so ive got a small sample size that ive seen him from but in the games i have seen and the minutes ive seen of him play hes looked very impressive and everton have looked very poor so far this year so i think it looks a bit of a perfect matchup for him to maybe get his first you goal of the season under his belt in there but i also really the look of seeno at bournemouth i think its one of those two that you go for and im considering im i up both for my team in future weeks on the bench smith johnson and marillo in case theyre needed but now were going to have a final talk about the captaincy so were not going to make this section too long so you guys can get off and
