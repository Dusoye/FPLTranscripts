support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay welcome toone this walsh youre kid it up today kid it up of the thrashing i picked this up in the uk felt relevant felt like how you doing did you get it at like the nike store or what where do you where do they we were walking around girlfriend doing all the shopping im just tagging along then i was like wait i want to go in this store and it just all kits it was just all like retro kits like this is even from like three seasons ago or whatever gotcha no palace kits sadly but i got my nephew a couple kits i got him a fulham not related to me going to the fulham match at all i was just picking from what they had kid size and then i got him okay this sick ax 1998 kit its so sick he wont appreciate it at all but ill be happy when hes wearing it okay full you what are you doing to him you might be indoctrinating him unknowingly brainwashing him hes just like in the stage of his life where hes just full kit wanker every day of his life like school put on the messy kit with the messy shorts with the messy socks and his boots you got you got to have a word with your brother all i like messi im happy with it no but full kitted with wankers i wouldnt allow d to go full kidding dude i for it at that age goodness okay come on hes six hes just showing his love for the game all right all right so team wsh team walsh is doing good doing whats happening in team walshs part of the world i dont know dg i dont know im just falling into all the things its going wild carded on 96 read the people of your team all right so i finished on my wildar with rya defenses trent robo didnt move from that for one second during tinkering rico who i didnt start with and f fell into after i spent more time thinking about defense like mid midway through the week and look you got you another clean you just got three cleans there right they just he just did it a different way he got a six point way six points clean no matter what and then i have pow and greaves on the bench my plan is just start rico every week and when he gets zero minutes pal will come off and thatll be probably fine and ill deal with it later when it becomes a problem and then my midfield i have palmer rogers mo bumo e and then my forwards i went with kai watkins and joe ladro j pedro who i benched this week i just i had a lot of i spent most of the week on 4 five forward because i just didnt feel like it was i wanted to spend a million there but the more i looked at it with rogers it just felt like when i was going through how is this team going to fail that seemed to be the biggest issue and if i had no money and i was moving somewhere from rogers i felt like i would just be ineffectively using transfers so i just put jao pedro in i dont remember what the sacrifice i made elsewhere was i think maybe it was like the bench or you were toying with saka right you were like maybe out saka set of palmer because youre going to want him and so that was like a i dont i dont remember exactly where the edges were this feels like the team that you initially sent me it was a million so i think what i had was a four five defender instead of greaves and i had 0 five in the bank that was what i thats what i and then i ended up just putting it all in j pedro and putting ges in im so happy with this team so palmer definitely shortterm probably game week six ill get rid of him because i do want to get sck in for those two games i think its worth it and even though palmer has good fixtures his fixtures turn very quickly after that and i just i just feel like saka for the home lester home southampton backto back could be 30 points there and i just probably want that and then my plan is to get holland in for watkins and probably mo probably moow palmer watkins to saka holland and some cheapo is something that im gonna want to do in a couple weeks but i look good to save for the next couple i think im in good shape right now and so how many fre are you on now im like confused okay two free captain bumo so that was genius worked out and aaron said whos walsh selling to get holland back in or is he sticking with his balls like dude are you paying attention while its just flying right now theres no theres no panicking to get holland right now no it doesnt it doesnt matter at all until game week game week seven and you look look im not married to that because while home fulham is good i could be okay not captaining him that week and then the fixtures for him its its the real home bankery banker is game week nine theres no if hes fit theres no universe where im not going to have him for that game more likely than not im going to put him in for seven and cap him for seven and nine and then reassess maybe ill get rid of him again because i like not capping him for a ways and for nonhome bankers so even though he had it this week i didnt feel nearly as good as like the home the previous week he looks great seven goals in three games and brent home brenham home arsenal at newcastle im just going to stick with what i got and hope watkins finds figures out how to get his head out of his and finds the back of the net tbd on that but big tbd big tvd but thats me one more walsh question before my team dr brad said with an extra week of data would walshs wild card be any different which i thought was an interesting question it definitely would be because i think then the palmer saka question it gets closer so i dont know if i would end up going with sock over palmer in that in that position but like we talked about we like the palace fixture for palmer and they ended up matching each others points on six but if youre going to and then i i prefer polymers four and five to sakas but when you get closer to having to use the transfer i dont know im not sure how that trickles down or how many free you have but other than that rogers was worrying i still like having walkins for this run he still is farming chances hes just not finishing them he still returns has home everton home wolves at it switch i know every wild card team ive been seeing in discord has mo and holland and its difficult to imagine not doing that but i just i just dont think its correct because we cant captain both of them ever so you have to i think spend more time looking at the captain there are so many good picks and when you have 28m of your budget in two players if you have rogers and seeno and 5555 p j comes back to the pressure point thing its almost like if you just made like a an excel spreadsheet of your team and were just like who are my greens who are my yellows who are my reds i feel like a lot of the discord teams with even three mum teams im seeing with palmer mo and holland just like theres like six yellows in your team youre looking at like a problem thats a problem these teams im seeing are like trying to go without trent or jamming in like robo with cheap defenders jia pedro starting every week with no cover and look thatll be nice for home it switch home nfo and then youre looking at it and to me id be saying like i dont know if i want to start him for any of the they have home bs like i dont view and that could i could be egg on my face because they might just continue to improve and he is a starter its its its stressful i think and rogers right hes dont know if hes hes good irl i dont know if hes a good fpl pick still we got to figure that out well get there but how about youre also im doing great quite great 87 i got there the more traditional way than you the capping boomo and sh i just have holland cap for a hattrick i have mo i was thinking back of like where we were at pre game week one and i was like huland a mo im just going to get him and when you think about its simplifying the game its like theres i either theyre both going to be doing well therefore im going to be doing well and happy that i have both of them or one or two of them or not going to be doing that well and i can get any player in the game its like the oversimplified version of that and it turns out theyre both the two best picks in the game so im doing well i got another trent clean he his point dodging is on another level this season unprecedented hes dodging them and he also has 20 points which is also a funny thought i had today that we something we never talk about is like clean sheets as an avenue right cuz like i had dku also who also creates chances and everyone hits the bar and y yada y but he has no other avenues either his teammate finishes across or slash cutback or hes getting or hes blanking and hes blanked every game and meanwhile trent just rattling off three cle no problem leaf davis mvp with a seven pointer esa got finally got a goal nine pointer so just fine i already made two moves though because of the j aention jiao pedro price changes so i ripped out doku and mun for jiao pedro and e exact funds feel like im in a pretty good spot with one free with that team moving forward so i feel good m just didnt work out and smith wrote too if he didnt get the goal that goal that 10 point i dont know we could prob were going to have to spend some more time talking about fulham probably i dont know if were it today but thats the thing thats the thing where you have holland and mo and if your five5 is blank its okay if youre your cheapest guy blank its okay when theyre just scoring 15 points both when theyre both scoring like around 15 points every week it covers it papers over the cracks and you dont need much from those picks to still be fine right thats the thing its like dku smith throw and mun smith throw very close to blanking all three and the other two did blank all three but one return in nine games you have to set your priors with these picks anyway right like if i had a crystal ball in front of me that said nothing else other than dku starts all three games 100 for man city i would have been like auto this phenomenal pick and he started all three and created a bunch of chances and i he blanked money is hes going to get however many shots he has in three games i dont know 12 like that and a bunch of them are good chances i would have been like thats good that i want that player what if he was going to get zero shots and 12he headed shots well if the cris ball just showed me a head and said all shots are coming from its like the xg dots on his im not sure im not sure or bicycle kicks thats the mood special three headers and a bic 90 the esa goal was a big pressure rel though that was huge gordon only has one return in three games but it was a 10pointer and i feel good about their fixtures eso got the assist in the red card game and then a huge gold max bones this game so that calmed the nerves a lot with that pick so im like pretty stable im not amazing im not a wild card team no im definitely not especially after these two free but im okay and i i still like most and you have leaf and i have leaf so this start every week easiest game in the world so ni nice that he just came in right away and got you a seven pointer its so huge with a side pass from midfield but he looked he looked good dude he was everything i wanted him to be yep august mug winners first mug of the year and were shipping five mugs out this month because of the triple tie in third place nathaniel brown in first place ak no mystery sathia aka jitterbug on discord aka wharton heres a who in second place and then a threeway tie third place michael kaufman aka mishka aka

was also the funniest live stream in my life my godic laughing like the whole time i was crying all right all right thats that so you have to wait one more rory button aka ding dong diogo good job you good job by you september another three game week month rip for mugs if you have chips because of the international break right now can you imagine a world where theres just no international breaks one season thats just nfl schedule style every week no friday games maybe a couple monday games but i dont even give a about monday games no friday games no international breaks its just every week theres games on saturday games on sunday can you imagine how good that would be wouldnt mind it god were on day two of 14 right now its terrible its unbelievable its so bad day one jesus christ there were games yesterday day one i always feel like the first week of the international break is are like among the worst weeks of the whole year where its like i have to go through all this and then i get to the mon next monday and im like finally okay at least this is like a normal week and i have the same and then i have the same buildup to the weekend and then guess what another international break after game lets you depressing me here with this talk so what do we got going today baby we got games to talk about we got question a lot of happening man a lot of you mentioned villa maybe we go there im curious because you watched this game and i didnt what you saw questions wise wolfie summed it all up he said where do you stand on villa assets ahead of a ridiculous run it feels like the attack is where you want it to be but bailey has potential injury watkins is low on form and a rotation risk is it rogerss team now i that it was a difficult game to watch having rogers and watkins the first it didnt take long before rogers to oly with the oi up was just that was the le like the story of life of the game but i villa just i still theyre just getting away with it almost like newcastle similar to newcastle where for them to be on six points is maybe reasonable because the west west ham were pretty poor gamei one but they were just broadly bad this game and their balance just feels off tian zonana just doesnt seem like that works to me and the fullbacks are problematic the bogard was probably their worst player he was putting up he put up a zero he was so bad and dean on the other side is just limiting in terms of how much he can give you and i just feel like their balance is is just off and rogers didnt play well he wasnt his best game he was getting physical to they were fouling and needling and niggling like they were just all over him and he had a hard he had just had a hard game he had a hard time dealing with it and he it felt like he didnt have confidence in his touch or just i have assurance as he did like the games before where he was just taking everyone on and just in beast mode so the early injury to baile also moved him over to the right which changed things dramatically he hadnt done that and just doing that mid first half i think he was also just a little bit thatll team just not used to it and everyones doing different things when bailey does do so much for them in terms of outlet and creating space and losing him after 15 minutes was a was a was a hammer blow they dont have especially with emmy bndo seemingly i dont know where he is hes fit not hes on the bench i dont he yet hes a like hes just not and then filene hurt right and thats like so all of a sudden they just have no width depth at all they got rid of diabi and they dont have someone to play diabs minutes so like bays out so i dont know if hes going to switch to playing with duran and watkins which he might have to do matson could do a job he im not like calling this my god out of position matson but he could fill in their left wing i just i struggle to see how they score goals like when they have all these players who want to play more centrally and wheres the width what does a goal look like im im not sure they looking at how the personnel is going to be central mids like ramsey was seemed good on highlight but what i was going to say is like the opposite end of this take is like it could have been 2n in 20 minutes easily like alli is getting huge chances one v one that he didnt even get a shot off so it does even like count towards his shots or ex or whatever the one the goalie fouled him or he ran over the goalie as he up his touch that was a oneonone and then he got another oneon one off target and thats like a oly peak olly goal but like what eventually hes going to score and then things will get going but but like yes those were two good chances they didnt continue to create and have more of them though like they didnt have a good chance after the onana go and the onal was one of those but theyre playing theyre playing lester and they rode their luck they could have easily went away with a point and i honestly i feel like a point fit most fair result on balance a score draw but lester gave them some problems and the sub and the its it doesnt smell good from it doesnt smell good but as a nonowner i feel like theres sometimes more clarity as a nonowner than an owner as a nonowner i was like my god i got so lucky cuz that could have been an triple return subs on 65 im like i have to wild card probably because i have to get him for this run and im if i dont have him he subbed on 60 on the nose again so hopefully these two weeks good hopefully these two weeks i dont imagine hes going to be going to england maybe he is i have no idea but hopefully these by the him get him back up and again right this is a thing where im he still got five points so its not a he got something by the way did he touch that ball i think he did they had one replay they showed many replays there was one where you could tell many angles there was one where you could tell that the trajectory of the ball got slightly altered when it pass him but there were plenty of angles where it looked like he was nowhere near the ball is this there was one from there was one from the sideline like the near sideline i remember seeing i was like he did touch but like thats the thing where they he didnt do the things or he kept doing the things hes been doing all year missing his chances so if youre wild carding now youre looking at him like i dont im not doing that they even though they have good fixtures like hes not showing me anything and that could be fortunate or it could be very unfortunate because as we talk about fixtures and form and what breeds which its fixtures breed form so im still going to just give him the next three and you after after the up switch game im just going to reass assin look if he gets me six points in the next three or nine points in the next three then ill just get rid of him im just going to not have him anymore and ill get some good forward and ill be fine ill get eso or whoevers good then and thats fine for me but its its disappointing but i do want to just make another note on rogers like its hes hes hes clearly very skilled and good like at things in real life and he helps the team a lot and he floats and drifts hes good at football good touch like good vision good passing he could have three assists right now and we wouldnt we wouldnt be worried about this but hes the player that for him to be an fpl pick the team has to be playing well because hes not going to just be like e and just be like im just going to blast the world or im going to take six shots in a game hes just he goes with the game he and hes influential and important when the team isnt playing well i think thats with rogers im just like h like i dont know if im gonna even start him over bumo this week i plan to before the week and i think i want to try and stick with that because i dont want to overreact to one fixture but if you have if you have him and hes a start every week with no bench cover i would be looking at a plan for gw seven to figure something out there because we havent even mentioned europe they could look they are struggling to put a good 11 out right now right now theyre injured and they dont have a deep squad and they might just be up in like newcastle war last year where theyre not going to look good all winter all fall and all winter like i can theyre laying the groundwork for that theyre starting slowly and europe starts very imminently so villas concerning to me that stuff is not linear its like em is emry a good coach yes like do they have good players yes but like when is it all going to click no idea it could be in february its like theyre starting to look good and this is good for next season but like we dont we dont know you answered one of these questions but the other one was benji i a lot of people are wild carding because we got a lot of wild card questions theyre fair wild card benji said if youre on wild card over the international break is it even worth the point 6 to bring rogers in your team over winks or insert any4 five if hes just going to rot on your bench and i still think he is i still think getting an eighth attacker at 51 is still worth it so one note on this which im a little bit dis i didnt spend any time thinking about this and i wish i had but i think you just go adama honestly because he doesnt have europe they dont have competition for a spot they did they did bring in one wing they brought in a guy well bring one guy re brought in rees and they signed someone i think i think reese is the main thats forgot he because he can play on the right for sure but its just re its just rees i dont i like i feel like hes adama is going to be playing every game unless he gets hurt right and if youre never starting like thats the thing if youre getting rogers youre never starting him then i would rather have an attacking 5m who i know is going to be starting every game and we have no idea when europe starts over the next 2 3 months if thats going to be the case so i would look at thats fair mil was happy with the dh he got the goal which is a goal i like ive never seen him score that goal before i feel like ive seen him every type of goal because he just like its like random like ive seen him shoot that ive seen him take that chance and put it into the ive seen him do everything thats what like hes the perfect like i show my nephew an adama compilation in 15 years and hes like hes the best player in the world right and im like well what if i told you hes one of the worst danny i said is watkins not a captain pick if he keeps going off at 60 probably not a captain pick and the last villa question was big dunk he said is onana the villa pick and the new doug louise or is it just not sustainable no its ridiculous he doesnt have pens so hes someone very different i think it was liam and discord made a good comp to soup check onana good comp great you could have a charmed eight goal onana season and if he does it in a twomonth span youre flying but his goals are just headers and like lucky late runs into the box its not hes not an fpl pick to me even the late run was a design setpiece like even his ones that seem like open play are still not open play at all do you think that note is overthinking with rogers about not getting him and getting someone like adama because of your potential rotation with him or is that reasonable i think its reasonable i think theres a higher percent chance that roger starts trickling in with some like 27 minute appearances more than adama even though adama also gets subbed every game which is annoying at least hes starting every game with very little competition theres only reese for both wings as far as i can tell harry wison like he but hes the guy who subs on like i dont think i dont think hes about to like i dont think hes knocking the door down for like a start the only thing is if he does want to push hogle up and play burge like theres all of a sudden theres one spot between a wes hogle and that smith row lukic like the other thing is if hes thinks hes going to have an aneurysm because hes watching adama every week and hes like i just need to like never see this guy play again ideally but thats fair lets talk about city okay so this ones targeted a little bit for you callie said walker came on for gardial is rico lewis the best defender pick in the game easy game gets an assist kid is unbelievable i dont know so funny how short our little goldfish memories are like my god what do you whats your rico because you were you were trying to push me off rico for the sake of depth like that my position when you ended up with the jao pedro taking a million from taking five from one of your backup defenders and you had 05 in the bank cuz i had kilman instead i didnt have pow i had kilman and dunk were my two four fs with rico because i like tren robo 3 four5 and one of them being rico and my stance was also i want you to have jao pedro we were both like pretty a line that like you need cover for this team like having just rogers is not good enough and my thinking was in a team with trent robo rico 4540 its a little thin at the back because like villas defense isnt even good and after this run youre never going to want pal to come in you never want greaves to play i have leaf davis but at least he attacks and then like i was just envisioning a world where like rico is no longer starting every week and youre unhappy with your third defender but i was still high on rico just trying to find the balance right it was like i just want there to be cu im worried thats going to be a problem i dont know he looks great hes always looked exactly like this to me like its hard for me to tell like if hes taking a step forward hes doing one specific thing maybe that pep wanted him to do that he wasnt doing before but hes just great hes just like a great talent in a bobbing way of just like hes such a good touch clever such a good dribbler will he keep starting no clue at all especially in the hard games probably not would be my guess aral fulam arsenal those are the ones he misses and doesnt sub on the thing thats fascinating with him a little bit to me is they dont have a fullback like him on the team so when they dont play with him its just gardiol is the most creative one and we remember the end of last season his heroics where he was just coming in and scoring and getting points for fun but he did it in a very different way its like a lot more like root one like or hell go on maybe more d more direct rico is like youre say i imagine hes just another year in the system not positionally getting caught out like he maybe would have done last year but the way that his he he just plays he was playing in midfield hes playing like an eight he inverting stones prime stones rooll exactly and hes 46 now but its pretty good it feels good im glad i have him im happy to keep starting him and like where i came and came out at the end with my specific team with pow is if rico is a problem when pos run ends then like i just am going to need to do something about my defense a transfer a transfer i use a transfer pick your favorite four or five guy for the next 10 weeks and you pick him and i might get rid of rico at that point cuz he missed he didnt play for four games in a row and hes just sitting on the bench like cu pep changed his mind about something because thats how he rolls or i get rid of how and i just get someone else who has a good fixure run and its not him in six game in worst case it seems like its just one free which is not that bad thats where it seemed like but its like red rede jedi had this question he said with pep not playing foden stones or walker yet and europe about to start should we just avoid all city assets other than holland and like i think this sums up like what we all know is that like other than holland probably kev probably also is lumped in with the rest not in the holland category anymore theyre all going to get rotated and we dont know whos going to start and thats a big reason i ripped doku out of my team i feel like i got a little bit lucky to get three starts out of him but like im not banking on that for three more and i think thats like broadly right and thats why like rico is interesting because hes cheap and you can cover easily defensively right we all have a fourth defender that plays and most of us have a fifth defender that plays unless you still have barco like me so its easier and we wont know this until we see him not start some games but we are anticipating that when he doesnt start he doesnt sub on that its going to be a zero minute because pep hates subbing he hates making subs period he likes just giving guys full rest and not putting them in that position for whatever reason so if thats the case it just makes rico when hes rotated unlike with foden or bill like b or doku or whoever all jack kevin they have so much more likelihood to sub on because those are the positions that you typically use your subs more that could make rico just he should be an every team pick and hes getting close to that honestly i dont think hes getting close yet i dont but i do i think we could be about three or four games away from its just like hes should be in he just should be in every team hes going to be 48 by then if hes starting some games they still look good he gets another dude he should have he should have a goal he had he had two he could have two but he should have one like so if you add if you add seven more points onto him hes just sitting there with trent points thing and hes good pick good pick well see when the other guys integrate i dont know but good well the other guys is just one guy its kyle how whats gonna happen stones right sure well stones thats still barely consider him a city employee at this point i dont know what to believe its crazy he just never plays hes never picked never fit never plays and then at some point hell play 20 games in a row be the best player on the team and then ruban just smacks it in his own goal like a piece of that he is genius by him and raul said doku is close to points every week surely a seemingly nailed pep wi who and play both left right is not a transfer out and i just replied to him like too late hes out of my team he i gave him the run that he needed so thats it and the last city question was just mor ari said two hattricks in a row is it even worth it to transfer out holland and have more premiums im guessing walshs wild card performance last week says yes it is different though its different with freeze than with a wild card yes like im not transfering him out dr no its so dramatically different because if you cant if youre doing it with freeze you need to have more freeze than you have right now to do it you need five four could work three is for the holland move because youre distributing so many millions you can make i dont have holland and i just scored 957 whatever the points so there are a ton of good picks in the game and there are a lot of different a lot of different teams you can make that are great without holland as they would be with him or could be with him it depends how quickly you can redistribute and how many picks you have are just not that good right thats it okay what game do you want to go next well i just i just want to talk one thing we talked about southampton a couple games ago as like this is the team to target and then just every game is just more loudly reinforcing and giving us more loud evidence and information that they are the team to target brenham could have scored five in that game i was watching that game it was horrifying as a nonbo owner they are very burnley they are very similar to burnley last year but like first half burnley somehow figured it out in the second half they were shipping as many honestly maybe southampton will too like its possible they still like thats a that was a takeaway of the game was like they dominated for large chunks of that game of course they werent creating good chances because theyre very bad players but like its weird like the zone their defensive third was just a feeding frenzy for brenford they created seven big chances from turnovers there but when it was in southamptons attacking third they were pretty good like suara is good lana came on was good bbd looked pretty good so like thats a burnley esque thing to me is like they would just like surprisingly hold possession and then like mer would like do some dumbass and like whatever it is and they feel very similar to that i hear you no thats a good comp but and that was sids question hes like is bumo a great pick or is southampton just in the business of getting themselves relegated but i think that both things are true exactly like how many games of bumo being god tier without tony do you need before its just like factual we see weve weve seen it with him for enough of a sample size to know that hes electric and has all the avenues and is a phenomenal pick so bumo should be in every team after the next two game weeks just like e and thats other like if you have the holland team and you have like neither bumo nor e and you have like mo and then like youve got trent like you have it in different places and youre in good shape but and i got a this week you have him now those are the picks that you must have in my view to cover over some of the other cheap expensive players that you dont have deal and game week six like im not sure right now that im gonna have enough freeze to have like a team im happy with like i might have to wild card in six but which is fine which is fine newcastle go they have home man city in six and then like a tricky run because i expect everendon to not be the worst team in the league and then brighton chelsea arsenal right so thats a convenient time to like you want bumo and you want three arsenal players like boom thats thats all your moves in gameing six so you need to figure out how to make that happen for sure but southampton bruno plays in this week y early game mean i expect at least three goals for man utd against southampton theyre rashford garnacho bruno should fill their boots i expect i expect every attacker against southampton to filer boots unless they show otherwise so i think im seeing a lot of frustrated people that have bruno that are like just ripping him out at all costs and i shout to sammy i definitely wouldnt ahead of southampton he could come in with a triple return easily in this game so i wouldnt any attacker before southampton bad y yep should we talk about man united game we only got a couple questions benji said is the stench at old trafford enough to make bruno mazero and the other potential picks of voids and then vikings said if youre still not on mo is it rip up your team aka wild card territory if you dont have mo i assume you have holland so youll be okay cuz you can still captain holland this week and homeor is a pretty good fixture for liverpool gek five that is again right that was such an huge factor for me why i wanted to have mo was for captaining him in game week five because five is a little bit tricky of one and city smaller five for those following but as far as man united go theyre just g to finish somewhere around seventh and the players are cheap so im not like seeing a reason toay panic there like theyre not premium assets and the fixtures have been a bit of a mixed bag we know brunos underperformed and the fixtures on the horizon are incredible after the southampton one specifically they have some tricky ways and the homes home spurs home brandham theyre not incredible if you have like maeri its fine just ben this week bench him and spurs whatever its f i assume youre not getting him as a start every week pick and i think you just hold bruno for this week reassess but look lipo almost scored mesi almost scored versus liverpool like that was their best shot of the game so and ugar will come in and a lots going to be made of the midfield as it should because its undermanned and theyre going to struggle with europa league theyre their streets behind liverpool this is any team thats going to finish lower high between seventh and 10th are going to get destroyed by liverpool this year and thats who they are and theyre priced accordingly so if you look at them more in that context and through that lens rather than theyre supposed to be among the best picks in the game and theyre one of the best teams in the league which neither of those things are true nor have neither of those things been for years basic but thats still how we thats still how theyre viewed talked about fpl towers have gotten fans but just just premier cuz were just weve been conditioned to that reality and look their defenders are four five and five theyre theyre price just like aston villa and thats everton or whatever right so thats fine exactly im to im totally with you i dont think theres any more of a stench now than there was game week one its all the same players and the same manager they made good signings its the same team if you think theyre good youre going to get disappointed because they havent been good and theyre not gonna be good but if theyre just not good but if you recognize where they stand in the world and theyre fighting for europa conference league then like theyre theyre off to a fine start they have a win thats pretty good for them lets go on the other side though and talk about your team it was a dismantling performance any change in the i think the liverpool power ranking of the pick its tough where do you see tough between its between mo diaz jot soos behind all of them trent robo kates five vbd 6 mo is still brian had a question about like diaz and jota and then after the match he responded forget my question all good attacks go through mo and its just like like hes still just by far the best he is one of the alltime greats hes just unbelievable looks as fit as ever had the summer off they have seven goals on the season and he six involvements hes three goals three assists insane the hair transplant not having the sicho bob curlys i like a lot but i would have preferred if he did this though and just embrace the me too one of us its okay youre married its fine they just weird theyre weird just are all do you have any athlet well never mind but lets trail that off there i mentioned this i think last pod like theres got to be some out andout liverpool supporting maniac who just went mo diaz jot in their game week one team and they are flying cuz j diaz should not be 75 if theyre starting every week i think like to made them all 75 because they just assume theres just gna be so much rotation everywhere nightmare none of them are going to be picks y and maybe that would have been true under klo maybe that still will be true when europe starts next week but as of now if theyre starting every week theyre completely broken and ridiculous picks so how do you stack up those six trent robo kate mo diaz jot which three i think mo and trent speak for themselves as being well ahead of the pack theyre both nailed and theyre both the best like trents easily the best defender in the game mos easily the best midfielder in the game i dont think anyone would even argue with that and like we said with the trent point dodging he had a he had a goal overruled this week hes created many big chances that none have been scored dont need to go any further into that but then outside of those i still like jota but hes gonna get rotated as soon as were back its like efl cup game and then champions league game and then more games so it might be a world where like i like that you have mo tr robo because robo i think is also safe to start all the games but i dont think its impossible that like the best three are just mo and trent and just get someone else whos amazing as your third pick not a liverpool player so even but what even with diaz and jo youre in youre that worried about rotation that i am you wouldnt have them what i dont have their fixtures i like wanted to look into the champions league fixtures more but i didnt have time but it gets insane immediately its three games its three its a game every 3 days theyre home nfo on saturday the 14th and then theyre away ac milan on tuesday theyre to fly on sunday immediately for a way harder game so like already i dont and darwins not going right like hes banned from international games for like six games for fighting fans and like already its just like well i could see darwi gakpo starting easily at home nfl its just too scary so for me its like i think you got your points and youre happy and i dont think that theyre like you have to hold diaz you have to hold jot at this point im worried about the rotation okay interesting okay and what about kate because hes been a monster since he subbed on and the last two and half games hes just been a beast hes so are you worried about him rotating to because like i he would tempt me over robo on wild card as maybe the third guy because youre youre freeing up a mill like you could show me a team that has if i put that million somewhere else when i if i if you have like trent kate rico 4545 behind them could be an interesting one i think i like that shout especially because we saw robo against man united with garnacho on that side whos just hes just too good to let run free right so all of a sudden the robo that was in the box getting shots taking corners l just did not exist at old trafford at all he was just complet he was left center back they play three he didnt attack at all so like robos trending downwards a little bit because man united is not the only team in the league with good wingers who are fast the only thing we dont know and i think its probably worth a ticket to find out is like is he going to go full klo like kate cant play two gam a week and im never going to let it happen or is he just going to be like hes one of the best center backs in the world play him like you play virgil which is probably the way to go like you talked to neil in preseason right whos just like what are you saving him for and i remember and i so vividly remember us having that conversation like hes fit like this is the bracket of games like hes right its like play your best players when theyre fit because theyre ev yes theyre gonna get tommy john surgery like just pitch so im tempted to take that pun if youre on wild card thats appealing to me maybe kante f5 that like that m the thing with robo is if theyre cleaning at the rate that i believe they will clean at im happy for robo to take the occasional game off attacking when theyre playing a good team right and its the thing with cleans as one of the a yes right and i do believe kate despite his performance in the league so far telling us otherwise to be a donger he could have he could have two dos this year this is the story of his life i dont understand he will score goals event he will he is not they might be in the champions league but they might be hes good at scoring the champions league but theyll happen theyll happen so canate at five cuz we take the piss out of kate for his lack of availability but when he plays hes so generally hes so good and they bought him he was one of the best young center backs in the world and hes just not been able to stay fit for years but he looks right now and weve had weve seen him come back from injury spells previously and just not look that good hes had some 90s where its like god like canate wasnt that good but it look slugish or whatever hes playing this way and i dont know what the subtle demands on the center backs are different but he looks great five millions just liverpool are just like not they conceded some chances after it was already 30 which is concerning for clean sheet but pre that theyre just not conceding chances like header right was like half chances bicycle kicks like a header from a corner whatever but like in all three games its just like the defense just looks good so i like that shot liverpool good what about what about newcastle we got to talk about newcastle josh me and slim asking is gordon to bumo the easiest transfer of your life pyob said is gordon to diaz time or do we keep him for wolves and fulham and ja also just saying how do we feel about esok now and pir do if you have to sell one to afford saka to mo which one goes or both of themselves and im just like so opposite of every single one of the questions i feel fine with newcastle and am i crazy am i am i blinded i think maybe a little bit i think you should be a little bit more concerned than you are currently especially that the next four fixtures or threeways in home man city a lots been made of their home away form splits i think probably more overblown than anything and also they its been talked about because thats true right theyve been pour away for a while for months and months and months and months so while the away fixtures arent that grueling or difficult on paper they seem to make every away fixture difficult they went to bournemouth and got destroyed we talked about the team that they played in that game but look they were playing home spurs and they somehow got the three points but it wasnt like a convincing performance right by any stret but where are you why because you just feel like these two players are such tried and true tested fpl assets and that theyre just going to score a couple goals and theyre going to be involved in these games an interesting it was interesting and wasnt interesting at the same time the spurs game because it was classic and spurs spurs since game of five last year they dominate the ball they get high turnovers they tilt the field and guess what they concede big chances dont create any big chances and they dont create big chances and esa gets a tap in he hits the bar on some freak shot that was strange that was insane i dont even know what the hell that was he got another pretty decent chance gordon took seven corners and indirect freeze and created chance im just like to me i just saw like if these are still the same guys theyre maybe they havent clicked yet to the same level they were clicking at the end of last year thats for sure right fours and fives like every other game week but i didnt see anything that was like very alarming with either of two players and i think its a team thats getting better chars back talis back maybe some guys look at fit barnes starting i think was a huge improvement for the team and the away home away thing i just feel like wolves are a bottom five team fulham are whatever 13 team and like im those are just good enough for me and then im probably g to get rid in six thats just where im at thats reasonable getting hurt again is just comedy im curious about whats going on with trips because i wonder if hes going to saudi or like galas just gonna buy him because like there was a lot of noise about him wanting to leave and he didnt leave but hes there he should be definitely starting over livero definitely like its not even a close call and he played zero minutes so i wonder whats going on with that but because to me like the balance like when they have trips and they have that outlet on the right and they can shift over and like have create this tilted field theyve been doing that for years and theyve never not done that since edwards arrived actual and they might just also be having a hard time coping with that but he was their entire like ball progression their hub for every created chance so and theres a bit of a learning curve there like and someone like sha is hes not trips but hes a good passer and like him coming in will definitely change how they build up and move the ball forward and tanali will too so i dont know what the hells going on there but i still just think its a team on the up whos not playing champions league fixtures soon and these guys are nailed and playing well so their fixtures this season are difficult like they dont have any super awesome prolonged runs like they have all these like difficult fixtures spliced between like a good one with some awkward ones and like youre talking about right they have the these two good games even though theyre away and then think chelsea arsenal back to back and then i dont know theyre theyll be interesting we have to just give them time because the one game a week is going to be such a huge deal this year and there are only about four or five teams in the league that have the one game a week where i think we do need to pay a lot more close attention to see like getting players like bowen aention cant stop shout out to bowen these guys like gordon who just play one game a week if youre what if what youre talking about your fears about the liverpool players borns true like jot darwin gapo k they start rotating and if guess what gordon and esa play 90 every single week like if youre getting 180 in three games from diaz versus 270 from gordon its not close and 180 assumes hes like maybe starting three and getting subbed or starting two like it could be worse than that also three right so its interesting to just monitor it for this at this point thats where im at its like they havent been great theyve been okay and okay with some returns is good of and we forget the red card right the red card is so huge we j cuz they if they scored four in that game were like which they should have every other team does probably would have so that also changes everything and thats also why like es gordon are even in our teams right it like that game was like a big emphasis point so tough one to evaluate thats fair should we jump to some questions maybe lets do some questions lets see what we got here harley boys triple up of mo holland palmer plus a premium defender is perfectly viable with all the cheap options out there is there any reason we shouldnt have all of them and ure we always have one of the best captain options for every week and then jitterbug and brent followed up and said im on wild card is it stupid to not have mo and earling at this point we already touched on that with earling i think the three premium teams ive seen i havent liked any of them youre just going to be giving points back in defense i think and its usually not a thing right isnt like i feel like big at the back is similar to thrum and in that it comes up at some point every single season and usually my thinking is like doesnt that never work usually not especially when one of the thums is 15m and the other ones 12 and a half 10 instead of 10 and 11 and 10 also then its like okay we could maybe like if youre if youre trying to jam in saka palmer and mo its like a no its like you can get there and then your defense is still good your team still looks good its but the other thing too when i was wild card tinkering was like i did feel like the pool is very small of players that i wanted in certain price brackets like other than jao pedro there wasnt a single forward that i felt good about under 75 salanki might fit that mold soon and mata has been a little bit off the boil and weve had some tough games he might if we clicking a gear he might fit not right now oi even he has question marks kai is an incredible pick and then you have eso whos we talk were talking about the fixtures being very diff difficult to interpret you can choose your own narrative there all of a sudden were just theyre not that many forward picks like the midprice midfielders like im not too i dont like love wanting like gordon right now if youre just buying from anyone in the field so its like other than bumo and e im like i dont want anyone there in the cheap mids im like i love seeno love rogers dont love anyone else there so and even them its like even seena like start every week like they have some tough ones i dont know but like being able to sprinkle around the brackets like instead of having to go double or emphasize in anyone like cuz if you have less premiums then youre then youre leaning more on like well you have bumo and e and diaz and jotto you got to think of it like a depth chart what like you got to think of like heres my 75 that i like the most and theres this guy this guy this guy behind him and thats like your guys you can easily get to if this doesnt work out and then as you go down the list you dont want two five fs because theres no one behind them thats good and you dont want any of them and they might both be bad the trickle downs hurt hurts your team and the other aspect is with trent and robo its not having them just feels bad like theyre just so attacking and the defense is going to keep cleans and like i dont i just dont think thats good and its its also right were talking about like palmer mo trent could have 40 points right now and that would be like thats in line with what ive been watching and he has 20 which is still like the most or whatever right so i just feel like trent imbalances it a lot because theres the other world where you just go four fives defense right and you just go put it all in att tag you have three them like whatever you have no keepers arent getting bones them all no rya you just go four five4 a goalkeeper five four fs and youre just rotating whoever and then youre looking at okay well now i can make up the points cuz i have all these premium attackers im not compromising anywhere its just like the defense and i didnt spend time doing that because i just i was just so want i wanted trend robo so much and i like the sevens and i like the way the balance looked but if you are that hellbent on going with mo and holland i would look at that that might beable thats the thats the upside of like a good game with good priced assets is that like i think thats very viable and theres not like theres no four five thats on a top defense right or we all have them well rico r but but theres definitely rotations that exist where youre like only starting them in home teams against the bottom 10 or whatever and like that can make a team good enough to start and maybe those six pointers that trickle in are going to be less than trent 12p pointers but you get exactly like you said youre making it up in other ways so i think its possible i think its possible cie and jam asking about munoz is it worth holding munoz or shifting to someone like rico lewis comes up again should have put r on the thumbnail holy you cant do anything here before lester but its just the right side without alis its not the same hes attacking he is up and down like his fitness and his work rate isnt in question but its ive been thinking about this a lot because its like why does munos look so much worse and the answer i think is simply that ois is so insane that like they had to do so much and double him and worry about him so much that munoz was in space in the final third constantly and hes always available right like whenever m get the ball the game is so easy because there lay it off so easy and this amalgamation of edward kamada had he decent end of the game but he was he had a rough game against chelsea not playing with one of the best wingers in the world surprise like impacting our team worse team and our right side and its concerning so i dont think munoz is that great of a pick i think you definitely just want to play him for last year i wouldnt be doing anything with him this week but unless if sar starts doing bits but even with kamata nether of these players sar might have a bit more pace ob has more pace than kamata for muno what he was we were seeing from him last year with ois he was overlapping underlapping making back post runs when the balls progressing on the left side and breaking out there because we were transitioning faster and now were just like dodgy stagnant slower football with like triangles breaking down and weve had a hard start a lot of our players are getting poached heads returned okay we know whos here now i expect us to improve but that was going to be my like i we bades we have bad pictures so we have united everton liverpool at nfo which isnt an easy one spurs those are not like not great clean she lets just let me just keep running muno out here like hopefully they figured it out we have to be playing well for that to look good like where we could maybe keep a couple cleans and so i think hes a cell its long and short of it i saw i felt like that second half against chelsea i was like yes theyre starting to click like palace has showing me something here but i hear you i a lot depends on like how these new center backs settle like is is chala just going to be great and the defense like is dor coming in for hughes and like they just look great cuz dor is so much better than him in every way well lroy also be good lroy so i dont know but i hear you its probably right kamada is concerning to me hes been its nice that they have lester because you could just wait just wait a week roll a week kams concerning hes just played badly hes just been bad pretty simple as hes just been bad and i dont know if its the physicality cuz it shouldnt be the tactics he knows everything under he play with glasner for months and months and years right but hes just been off it like hes just been so uninfluential and im im also surprised at how slow he has been to give sar minutes like even just subbing him on came on and looked good he looked good but i feel like hes subbing him on like late and you remember for mata which was weird matas i remember when sar was at watford he was having some issues with just like picking up what he was supposed like tactics and stuff like intelligence related st i remember that where it was like he was like doing i think back when they had mil or i dont know who i dont know he had im sure when he was at watford he had 12 managers but i remember like reading some stuff about that where it was like sars like football iq its like what im not sure about that but it just i just kamada on the right and i just want him to play are there like its just kamada coming in and its its so slow and i dont know that treat thats just dudes can just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time which is so true weve been doing that our whole lives its fun to just look at like whos on that like 1920 watford team its just like 1920 well 19 sl20 2019 2020 s wells j pedro deie brito they just have all these weird guys the greek fallback halls jerry d was on that team god dude like they dor is on that team some lads so many guys holes my god had so many h bosses all right so were were a bit of a mess still but we did play a little bit better second half i think you guys will get better i believe still so do i get better figure no problem with him do you okay think hes good im glad we got him because we needed some competent player whos not klein who can play center back so im very happy to well i think lets squeeze in a lifestyle question here before we go back to fpl arnest lot said for walsh if you were the sorting hat what hogwarts house did you put aan in i think i think als a gryffindor honestly wow is that good what does it mean i dont even know harry potters clan harry potter well all of them are in gryffindor the main character vibes thank you its its just cuz i you i think that the to me the biggest thing with griffindor are just like leaders and i think thats what youre like so thank you d thats it i appreciate it when are we going to do the second whens the second well it is international break so its a good time to watch a movie maybe ill watch it this weekend okay can you tell me if you do can you tell me because then i will rewatch it yes ill definitely alert you dont surprise me on this one okay i wont okay get you ready with questions and what not whis and did we got a i forgot to tell you we got like the we had the mets had a remember i told you i got all that mets gear from the guy who works with the team one of them was like a harry potter mets crossover where you got a scarf and it was one of the houses and like you didnt know what it was until you opened it so its like one so the colors were different based on the house colors for the harry potter but like mets insia no so like it had the mets insignia on all of them on one half and then the backside had the harry potter house and we got ravenclaw house did you get ravenclaw theyre like the smart party pants house nice i could see that what which characters in ravenclaw which that i know chang no i dont think any of them they dont theres no ravenclaws in it there there have to be but they dont like open up the other houses to the characters okay mainly just slyther the heel and the whats the non heal what do you call it i forgot okay heel and the what is it gast where are you we g hes screaming right now its a whisker said is kai good enough to cover for saka kais good hes good but i me what is the question i dont understand this question what does coverage mean what does that what does it mean does coverage mean if i have get the same and i dont have his teammate whos a better pick and thats why hes more expensive then im fine because thats not fine but i just dont know what it means i dont know what it means hes not cover because they both are g to score a lot of points in hom lesser home southampton in gaming six and seven so no thats my answer no i to me its like the coverage ideas know im not going to captain them are they going to get roughly the same points so i can get a cheaper lesser owned player to be equivalent to the other guy and i dont know theyre just both great but kais kais so good dude kai because of his price and mainly because of his position better i would prefer if i could only have one and then build the rest of my team i 100 its kai because mo exists and palmer exists and theres other good mids but theres very few good forwards and kais underpriced and saka is just appropriately priced matters thats fair thats there also i wanted to mention this no pensas here theres like theres no pens i think its probably one of those things where theyre like were gonna make a stand cuz were a referee union or whatever and then three months from now its like a pen every week cuz theyre just like correcting their dumb theres been two pens far two pens in three g so theres 30 games and there have been two pens thats up thats insane thats absolutely one was holland and the other was who was the other one hack yep y yep its thats crazy especially early in the season you expect i always expect more pens in the beginning of the season cuz random call whatever like sam sammy stack said because of the five transfer rule theres less reason to make moves every week as rolling is always an option im curious to hear your thoughts on moving aggressively and using transfers when we dont necessarily need to versus being patient and waiting for certain assets to pick it up thats a good question ive been thinking about this too like well not wild card but just looking at people like i have to get three i have to get four to get like i just cant do anything till i get five its like i think we might be a little bit over correcting on that front right how many points do you get when you reach five transfers is it 100 mystery chip if you got five transfers you get 100 extra points like i think thats going to happ you get like a xbox live reward you get a stress ball for it because then maybe priorities would change but its like balancing this notion of having four transfers or using two to dramatically improve your team if you can dramatically impr dramatically improve my team for 500 bob like i think you need to scrutinize a little bit more because like youre its like what were talking about kate like youre saving them for what like to still use them on these same players or is it like i want to buide my time because theres one or two bad fixtures and then its a sea of green and i want to use these transfers on these three players but like are you thinking about saving five transfers to just be okay im making five moves now or are you doing it to like whats the point i think we like i get another wild card if i get to five because i get to wild card actual wild card and then still have five but its like but if you wild card i assume your team is a disaster you just you just need three exactly like i think even wild carding like you coming out with two frees after wild card in because you almost always i dont think either of us have ever made a move straight the week after wild carding something very insane would even wild card you have two free you save you have three free like that youre in a great position youre in incredible position right there because i dont think the goal is get five and then start making a single transfer and float like youre not improving your team if youre doing that so like it does come i think the planning matters a bit more this year where you need to look at these are the these are the three or four players that i want to move and i want to do it this way and like thats where the depth matters a lot because you dont want to have to like for my team right like if as a picked up a knock i would just hold him and i have rogers and ja pedro but if youre if youre looking at your team and you have po po is a bank youre like ill just whatever but like thats where i feel like you want especially with europe starting off like you want to still be in position to save but if you have someone like you you have gordon right and youre happy with him right plenty of people have gordon not happy with him its like well if youre going to hold him for two away fixtures that youre not sure about how hes going to perform ahead of man city and then a bad run versus like dont get four free and just get bumo or bums bad he has two get just get like es strictly better for the next two and then hes a better asset long term as well so and like its like youre going to then wild card in six or seven and as is going to be in your team and gordons not so like you just make it sooner than later i agree with that ive just ripped mooney and doku out of my team on a sunday for that exact reason im like i dont want them longterm i dont trust them shortterm i think the guys im getting in are better shortterm right j pedros home if switch home nfo as is home lester home man united at everton like id rather have them than just save and squint and be like but mun is home west ham its like just make your team better get more points its interesting because it is very like the saving situation and taking hit no ones taking hits like very rare you probably should not be ever and i think that it makes sense because say having all these bank transfers like if youre just planning and getting safer guys then you can do it without but theres going to be some type of like the games going to going to correct itself and this new rules introduced and i think as a community or like us in serious fp air quot serious bro i think over in to one side where its like you should be saving under mostly all circumstances where it should probably instead of be that like thats like at a nine it should probably be more like out a six where its like you should save but no different than last year like when you could get two like its like every year weve ever played flpl saving is great if you can afford to save but we set our teams up differently because we couldnt get five frees so we didnt have depth didnt have we had fires all over the place because were trying to h roll right so its different interesting game the interesting stand it was cool to see three free transfers on my team before i used two of them and im back to normal one free but it was you had your fleeting you had your fleeting moment that was cool lets see not that many more questions as sheer said out of kai and esak which one should make way for jao pedro so funds can be released for salah and midfield i just trust kai so much more trust the te and also like im assuming if im wild carding in six then im keeping isach over kai but you have other scenario any other scenario im keeping kai because i know hes great i know the team he plays for is great and i know i want him in six i think thats just it oy said im asked us cuz we didnt talk about him is porro startable versus arsenal or a transfer out if we dont have another good defender to start do we bench porro i think he gave you a good idea against newcastle hes just gna farm shots that are low xg and he could bang any one of them but yes theyre not going to clean and right exactly what he showed me in his one pointer against newcastle is that like i can start this guy any week dont care creates chance takes set pieces and takes six shots like get in my team absolutely and you you were lucky enough or not lucky you were fortunate enough to be able to have your team set up so you could bench him in newcastle bench and youre going to start him in arsenal right youre not going to play nfl against liverpool so but then youre looking at a wide birth where you dont have any home bankers for a while i dont think home brand as a home banker honestly this year but no theyre theyre good but they could clean two of the next five you dont know which two of like home brenham at united at bren at brighton home western at palace like you could tell me theres two clean sheets there and be like which two 20 rolled any of those i have no idea no clue and he start you just start him all those games and youre midt defense just like billa playing midtable teams playing midtable teams and he takes a million shots pieces hes like a five5 leaf davis yes but his teams a little better well probably more than a little better theyre better theyre better but hes still great pick absolutely i am i dont like not having him after watching that game im just like i want i had teams where i kept him but rico just turned my head a little bit too much but it was sc watching him even with him first on my bench like i was just like god is he about to brace like am i flo said what four or five defense can you have in your team without a transfer for the next eight game weeks very specific but lets just call it longterm villa was one shed i but i wish i had leaf davis not just because this happened just recently but i just still feel like villa like i dont three like i have three villa players like how did i get here like i dont know what happened bright you were very close to dunk i think brightons but they dont have good pictures well they have home tr nfo before a bad run that also includes home talking about eight right start every week its definitely not a start every week its fair chelsea they have some good ones a few they have good for the next four they only have like one bad one even like brenham they have these two bad ones but then they have six good ones so the question is tough cu eight start every week for eight is hard for long time and thats why i go back to villa rate them or dont rate them its just the picture are just absurd and theyre just like that this most teams wont have a run this long and good all season right home everton home wolves at ep switch home man united at fham home bournemouth thats not eight but its pretty close its good i think you could throw landro in there they dont have great fixtures but i think the defense is going to be okay with defense should be good anthony robinsons there hes attacks a lot like hes just still good looks good rico you just start rico every week lot of lot of picks lot of picks and this is i like too the fix are just so bad initially but they got better theyre been theyre a lot better now that man citys passed them its true theyre just like fine now p said what are your thoughts on matoma for the upcoming run hard to go there its also hard to evaluate theyve had weird bad pictures they murdered everton as everyone does tough late winner home man united and then the red the red card up everything thats what i dont like about red cards right is theres nothing that we learned from that match i dont think like arsenal were beating the absolute out of them for 45 minutes and then a red card happened youre youre stressing the next two games i think very heavily for matoma that he needs to get points iwi nfo its the first game he the everton game he was like coming inside so much he was so influential where i was like is he not just doing winger stuff and then the next two games happen i was like no hes just a winger again and but that might mean that in the easy games hes not hes cutting inside right and like the hard games he has to keep the width or whatever it just feels like this season especially and looking at a player like this is if im not sure that its going to be a hold for a long time like i dont want to be spending transfers on my midprice midfielder goes back to the is he one of the best like 8 to 10 best picks attacker picks in the game and its like absolutely not the world where he is and this is another aspect with him looking at it where its like he has two incredible fixtures and then he has like a bad run for a month and a half look at his gw 12 he has at bournemouth home southampton at fulham at lester home palace at west ham home bref like i would happily wedge him in for like 12 because then youre like okay i could buy at least five or six games and i can deal with him at the end tail end of that run but i have like a bigger gap just like i can start him happily for at least four five six seven if i need to and i think with these non premium picks like with the five freeze like thats where we should be looking towards so with just two games im just like i like id rather get someone else either vacate from the premises e bumo where its like right as boomer for example even boomer with his bad fixtures id so much rather have him yes like dep team dependent like if you your wild then okay but if i have already wild card and im like i made a mistake i need to do like i would rather have bumo than moma right now for game week four and its not remotely close like its not even in the same stratosphere of close and so i think its its tough cuz hes competing with them hes competing with thats the hard part thats the hard part about in general right its like matas upside is like seven goals and bumo is gonna get four to five free ones his ups 15 goals hes gonna make that up in p possibly im look at my team a little closer like the odds are very high that im wild carding in six it makes sense you have the newcastle players cast players i have jao pedro all of them switch then my defense is thin because i still have barco just makes a lot of sense it does and you can probably start thinking about that and just save until then you can easily save until then okay you just have to hope you dont hemorrhage price too bad but even its not that important i have every most expensive player already in my team like and its still fine because the fulham too whats the fulham switch theyre fine for four five even their six is okay but they have two homes thats okay its okay forr okay ben said any thoughts on welms versus j pedro and soo said i second this lader play only played nine more minutes back to brighton and pedro is just such a better player and i think hes also just more flexible and on pens and by flexible he could play four positions and wbs can play one and fergusons not hurt anymore so im im with you on ja page right it just feels like hes good hes just good wbs is also good but in a very like specific way ja pedro just has everything and it seems like hes like herzler like loves him he keeps talking about him in such glowing terms leader all this and he just he pops up everywhere he can play everywhere hes he can make subs and just put him wherever he needs to put him and hes just so clever and the pens are weve just said theres two pens in 30 games but theyre going to get a few pens this year theyll get some they have and m and like they dribling more dribbling than like most teams in the leag he got how many he got what 10 pens last year all got so something insane so j pedro just seems like a safer better pick pens are just op the flexibility is also not nothing we mention you mentioned ferguson we mentioned rutter last pod they have all these wingers rutter or ferguson could start up top in any game and wels we know is injury record whereas like pedro can just slot over here slot over there do a job here do a job there find his way in the team last question was mish this is a fantastic question from mishka as usually he said now that ive used all my chips and came in as second loser for the mug what advice do you have to reset my dopamine and continue to be plugged into the game holding transfer feels like the hardest thing in the world right now so misha just needs to feel high from the game and what can we do for him here i think honestly the answer is triple ups on defense that is a true high like you need to have du you need to have dueling triple ups on defense that rotate and never captain the chalk never captain chalk never captain chalk just like look whos the most voted on whos the most obvious cap dont captain them dont pick that one y i me triple defense is risky that feels fun risky thats not wck its borders un reckless but its no but theres a difference like youre not tripling up on hip switch defense like find a good run and good players that you like on a team you like right and its like youre not just capping like youre not just like blind upack cap this guy like youre capping someone you like in a good fixture its just not hes not as good as holland in a good fixture also youre just taking those like me and maybe 45s and youre taking the 45 and maybe not even it depends how high you need to get maybe its not even rotating triple defense because even just like tripling on arsenal defense like every arsenal game is still a very like tight rope that youre walking but it does get boring if you do it for a long time so maybe you do need two teams though so you can rotate and feel different i think you should i think you should have two keepers and two defenders you should rotate between three teams you two like that you have three four five between goalkeeper and two def enders and then you have the fifth defenders are some rogue horor and youre just going snip snap trip something like that thats cuz then week to week youre rooting for like a different team you have like a different fixture that you care about different players you care about and youre just like trying to hit the jackpot youre going for like a stress ball youre just going for a team of the week situation like my god this guy had triple defense like spur defense he had vandan romero and poro one week and they lucked into it clean its like whoa all right that is a good one though good and then i have so many asses to slap unless you want to talk about something else first no i think were good dude so many signups thank you to everyone what we usually do here on
