yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is fpl nao and in todays video we are talking all things wild card going into game we four i want to look at the teams to target in the upcoming game weeks the players that you need to buy and of course whether you should have highland in salah or no highland in your ward team so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up when you are building a wild card team in gw 4 i think its really important to understand the teams to target over a longer term perspective now of course this season is a little bit different because of course we can keep transfers during the wild card so if youre one of those lucky managers that is maybe not used to transfer right now but its also wild carding in game week four youd actually come into game week five with three transfers available which is completely different to what we have seen in previous seasons so it means you could wild card in game week four but still almost do a mini wild card a few game weeks later to jump on a particular fixture swing and we need to talk about that in the fixtures on your screen now of course there are a few big teams that are not included in this list we will go through those including man city liverpool chelsea fulham so we will touch on those as well as what you can see on your screens but game we four and isolation has been a popular time for managers to wild card for a few weeks now i think theyve looked at this moment with a fixture swing for the likes of brighton for aston villa even for chelsea and felt this is a great opportunity to jump on some of the players available now in terms of brighton the upcoming two are great ip switch at home not enough forest at home in game week five but after that chelsea away spurs at home newcastle away even liverpool away in gw 10 it really does feel the team that if you were to wild card in game week four youd dont really be bringing in the value players l pedro for the next two game weeks and then maybe have to build a team where you either rotate that player in and out of the team during that tough spell or you do a mini wild card with your team and then look to jump off those players brighton do offer brilliant value and well touch on some of those players in this video but its worth noting it is a very short window where based on the fixtures theyre actually quite attractive in terms of ailla as well this is a great time to jump on them if you want to everton wolves ips which even man united at home i would argue is a good fixture and bouth at home in game week nine watkins of course has been little bit difficult to have any confidence in because hes been substituted early and his replacement in john durans actually been stepping up which is a little bit of a concern if you are looking to bring in watkins into your gw four wild card teams and importantly we do have the return of the champions league for aston villa what is that going to do with these aston villa players we dont really have the answer to that right now especially someone a morgan rogers who has been so good with minutes could we start to see a change in that in terms of the other teams right now it looks a bit of a change for arsenal if you were to walk card in game week four i do think theres an argument potentially to go without i think spurs away is actually a fixture that probably looks tougher on paper than what it is but spurs followed by man city if you are going to go without arsenal i think thats the time to do so however you will if your wild card in the game week four need to have a strategy in place that you can get an arsenal player back in gw six because leicester at home south hed at home even bournemouth away in game week 8 feels fix fixures that you absolutely need to have a piece of that arsenal attack and maybe one of the defenders so if youre going for the wild car 4 strategy please do make sure you take a look at game week six where the fixtures do swing because that is also the time where a lot of managers are going to plan to walk card so if you dont have a plan on how to jump on some of these play an arsenal asset which is going to go big we have to also remember as well liverpool longterm are great just running through the fixtures not forest at home bournemouth at home in the next two wolves crystal palace even chelseas home if youre wild card in game week four liverpool are absolutely essential you do need to double up on those man city as well the real tricky thing about man city going into gw four is that in gw four and isolation they have a great fixture at home against brenford but then in game week five they have arsenal and in game week six they have newcastle game week seven onwards the fixtures are phenomenal so youre in a tricky spot if you walk hard in game week four because i think the fixtures too good in this specific game week to say you need to move away from man city however you could then transfer out one of those players in game we five for a couple of game weeks if you need to free up some funds the other team that we need to talk about right now is going to be somebody a new castle going in away againsts wolves away gets fulham then man city it is a time if you want to move away from the players because the team havent been great and also i would argue the players havent been offering amazing value and if you were looking to maybe change it up in your team moving away from newcastle isnt a terrible move so thats just a quick recap on the fixures lets take a look at some of these teams first up with a haland and salah draft so first up as you can see i have built a team here which includes both harland and mo salah in it because i do think it is a viable strategy that managers do need to consider now i will put this out there this isnt completely locked in terms of the players i wanted to more build this team with an idea on how you could actually structure your team and then we could have a look at the rest of it here so in terms of the team we have got 45m goalkeeper at henderson weve got cheap enablers in this in the shape of rico lewis and coner and then of course weve got robertson at 6m you can see on the bench weve also got pedro por alongside robinson so we have good options in defense here and i would even argue if you needed to free up some funds in this wild card team you could easily downgrade maybe pedro porro to a 45m and if youre sat there right now thinking trent alexander arnold is absolutely essential you can then upgrade with that 1m from robertson to alexander arnold if you felt that was the way to go in terms of the midfield youve got your premium in mosala but we can also if you wanted to have cole palmer in your team at 106m it would mean though coming all the way down to the cheaper nebl midfielders in the shape of smith row rogers and e which i think all offer a fantastic value and i would say as well if you could go to someone a seeno i do think longterm he is a brilliant option for your teams when to take a look at the fixtures for balou they are a little bit indifferent however chelsea at home i do not think is a terrible fixure liverpool away you could easily stash him on the bench for that game week then southampton at home followed by leester away if youre going to ward in game week four i actually do think sano is being overlooked right now and i think his minutes are better than that of smith row so i couldnt afford him in this team but if you can get him in because he has slightly increased in price i think sano instead of smith row is actually the more favorable pick but as you can see with this team here you can get harland you can get sher pedro but we are put at a dead spot in that third forward in the shape of stewart i personally dont think that the forwards are good enough in gw four onwards to justify go for a three forward draft i would much rather go for some premium midfielders in this team the great thing about cole palmer is you can have him for the next couple of game weeks and as i spoke about in gw six sacka all these players who are arsenal have brilliant fixtures so what you could do in this game week then is then flip it do cole palmer to aaka in game week six and basically r with a structure of howand salah and of course bico saka and the problem with it if you were then to sell highland you cant really go back to him easily that is the big problem the cheapest player is watkins who is6 million cheaper then youre having to completely change the structure of your team to go back to him later down the line so look at this team right now i actually think it is quite attractive i think youve got the premiums in salah and palmer youve got er howland up top yes you dont have a forward between howland and xiao pedro but right now dont think there is one that is standing out as an obvious pick in your teams and i do think with a slight tweak in this team you could easily lets say downgrade pedroo to a 45 then upgrade robertson to trent and then if you wanted to do smith row to seeno with those small tweaks in the team i think youre getting closer to an ideal wild card in gw four but its worth noting i still think you need to have a plan in place for the fixture swing in game week six where you can get on those aral players and thats why i think wild card in gw 4 is a little bit worrying for certain managers depending on their team but this is definitely viable let me know your thoughts in the comments we now need to come to a draft which is a little bit controversial and that is going to be a no earling howland team so as i mentioned it is a little bit controversial going with no highland in a wild card 14 because as i mentioned brenford at home in gw four would you be surprised if he was to get another hatrick in that game i dont think we would be at all however as i mentioned to you in game we five in game week six he does have trickier fixtures theres no denying that so the first thing you need to not is this team has no highland however you absolutely need a plan in place for him in game week seven sorry in game week seven where he has fulham at home wolves away and then southampton at home i feel thats a very scary period to not have an er in hland so if you got a wild card and g before without howand please do have a plan in place to get him back and that is why ive put oe watkins in the team because at his price point it is a bit of an easier way to get to harland if there ever was one the problem with watkins of course he isnt delivering and also the minutes are a little bit of a concern with the champions league coming up as well the fixures are great but im just a little bit worried that we could see continuously what cans being substituted 20 15 minutes before the end and that never was a problem for watkins before so i think watkins is great but you do need to be concerned about that so what other tweaks do we have with this team well we can easily afford trent but importantly we can also put another premium midfielder in this team ive currently got for kevin de bruy mainly because in game week four at home against brenford its just a scary fixture not to have any man city coverage and i do think kevin de bruyne has been ticking over nicely the great thing about de bruyne as well he could be our cash cow to go to other directions if phil foden finally gets fit we have an easy route to phil foden in gw six if we wanted to for that man city team and if you want to go that highland i think foden or de bruy need to be in your teams weve been able to actually upgrade the forward line as well visa coming in at 61m i think brenford are a brilliant investment however maybe a little bit later down the line the next two they have city and spurs but then in game week six they have west ham wolves man united and ip switch so again those managers that are going to walk card in game week six are all going to jump on brenford you need to have a plan in place where you try and get on some brenford assets cu the fixures are fantastic with brenford if theyre going to score its going to be visa or its going to be uo contributing in that goal so with this team it feels a little bit more well balanced but of course you are missing one key player in the shape of erling howland but if you are brave enough to do it weve seen in the past few game weeks that managers who are without harland are still finding ways to not only match but sometimes do better than those managers that have howand in it so dont be too scared to do it the one thing i will say is this 45m goalkeeper at henderson im still going for that route but you could easily if you free up some funds maybe invest the 1m and go for a rare at arsenal longterm perspective is probably a better pick so let me know your thoughts in the comments right now i think the general consensus is a gw four wild card is actually quite hard to build but if youve activated it i think this looks great but i think its easier said than dont going without ear in the hland and i think naturally were going to default to a highland and salah draft and then look to squeeze in some value picks alongside it so let me know your thoughts in the comments which draft did you prefer and of course if you enjoyed the video in general make sure you do drop a and of course smash that subscribe button we of course be dropping videos throughout international break so hit that notification bell so you do not miss a thing take care have an amazing day and see you real soon cheers
