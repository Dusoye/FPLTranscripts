welcome back for another video final video of the week then were going to recap all the latest news from todays press conferences and were going to answer all your biggest ffield dilemas and questions for gami 5 lets get into it help mbappe win with his fantasy football team and lets prove that fpl managers are the best fantasy managers anywhere in the world so rare is a freetoplay fantasy football game its similar to fpl but he pick five players every match with a few twists mbappes got a rivalry gun of his little brother the prizes are insane right now when shirts signed by your favorite players vip tickets to match is so rare cards to use in games or if you can score 400 points you can meet mbappe himself so im just doing my team now since i know the premier league better than other leagues thats how im going to do my team mostly so allison in goal im going to go with trent as my defender salah is not a midfielder in so rare so im going to go with bellingham hes home to espanel and then ive got a limited salah card from a couple of years back so im going to use that and then ill go with robertson as my extra so all in on liverpool and then salah captain this week click the link below to play free and enter a team now ive played years and its an awesome game that complement fpl nicely first question from fabian who ask who the best replacements for munes are which is also a good opportunity to discuss the best budget fors in general right now ive got three replacements all of which can be afforded in one move cal l vard and welbeck cal did miss the leag cup midweek of illness but hes back in training so hes definitely an option and he does have the best fixtures of the three vards got two goals in four as well but hes only taken three shots while kav ls taken six while beckas got two goals one assist hes got the best underly numbers of the three but the worst fixtures of the three but in the best team of the three long term my favorite would be calvin lon for 59 mil my got feeling is theyll get a result away at leicester and win the game and although two and four is impressive for vardy its from three shots as we said and you could argue the fact that its 37 is a factor as well becka like only if youre going to wild on gamei six so essentially one meek replacement but it should be pointed out how good forest have impressed defensively who brighten the playe theyre third after liverpool and man city for expected goals conceded if asked to rank them in order itd be cal le and vardy and then welbeck ive seen dap mention a few times as well he does look a real talent but his minutes have been a bit all over the place he didnt make it to 60 last match casper asks who to start between gabriel cono and robinson now gabrielle off the back of a 15p pointer conso with the best fixture and robinson with a bit more attacking threat this ones a close one but id go with conso the three if youve got a defender dilemma on the fpl focal app you can go on the menu and then go to fpl odds and youll get the clean sheo and goal scorer probabilities every gameing from check the chance its completely free its quite helpful when youve got these defender maybe even goalkeeper dilemas and captaincy as well with the goal scorer odds sometimes your own intuition is needed though if one defenders got no attacking threat while the others got loads villa have got 36 chance this week fham 22 so id back the probabilities here robinson first on the bench so one piece of news today is eak how said hes taken a knock to his foot and well find out more today and then ill make a decision and he says hopefully its not too bad so jordan asks what to do with isak the problem with how is hes infamously the worst at telling us anything helpful in his press conferences like theres every chance hes already been ruled out but its also possible they are going to make that late call and he could start if youve got a strong option first on your bench and ill keep him otherwise id cut your losses and sell him if youve got the money watkins is a standout replacement but youre going to need not 5 mil to fund that if you watch the experts video some of those were going eak down to a budget forward from that first segment and then saka to salah and then captain salah so lets discuss that sacka to salah one then time is an illusion asks is sacka to salah with gaming five captaincy worth a minus four here this one feels like a tight call and it could have a huge swing as well if youve got isach and sacka then i just about go for this one last season arsenal versus city had the total of one goal across the home and the away games whereas salah tops the goal scorer probabilties this week and the gameing projections plus youre selling isak who is a doubt i think harand to watkins and sacka to sal is also a tight one but its a very aggressive move sending harlem with such high ownership that one i personally wouldnt do but i could definitely see it coming off if youre an aggressive fb manager as last did keep haring quiet last season watkins does have walls and hes showing good form now simon asks is this real life is this just fantasy ive looked into this one unfortunately were caught in a landslide theres no escape from reality bernie asks if wild card in gamei 6 is a necessity it absolutely isnt as the catchphrase goes it is very team dependent while caros are going to be building towards a core of triple arsenal bumo harand maybe palmer maybe seeno if youve already got most of that core on your team then its not necessity using my team as an example here in gameing six i can sell salah and smith row for palmer and bumo or i could sell salah and cannon for bumo and havers nether team is screaming for a wild card to be used but if shia pedra is an ongoing problem plus if any other issues pop up in addition to quanza already being one of my bench then it will be tempting to use it to clean up the team and to get triple arsenal which both are lack him gami 7 is also good c window fade force asks about west ham from gemi 6 onwards he says it looks like a good run of fixtures to gmi 20 so hes looking at bowen kudo and mavropanos west ham another one that the gaming six wild cards are no doubt going to be looking at theyve not been in our thinking for the most part from the start of the season because of the poor fixtures but from gami six its brenford ipswitch spurs man united forest everton and newcastle i like bowen more than kudos and id pay the extra 11 mil for that in defense wild cs could go for ariela and fabian which gives you a guaranteed keeper for 8 and a half mil emerson would be my pick of the defenders rather than mav panos assuming his knee injury is not serious hes yellow flagged at the moment in right back theres waker and soual competing so thats a nogo whereas creswell probably wont get sniff all season in left back some other important fbo news j pedro will train today ahead of gameing five with a late decision to made on his involvement ive got the full quote here which is he will train with the team on friday then well have to see how its going if he can train fully if he can all the movements we wont take any risks but he will be part of training h is turning into another hell here its not particularly helpful information its quite open to interpretation he wasnt in their league cup squad midweek and i do wonder if we might see him benched or perhaps not even in the squad ive moved him to my bench from now my team and start a concert ill run through my final team in a moment let us know in the comments what your feeling is on xia pedro i ran a poll on twitter as well and the results were as follows 396 say he starts 509 say ben 9 and 1 half say not in the squad at all so if theres any wisdom in the crowd here is one to think about if you had him starting in your team im sure in some cases youll have no choice but to play if theres no good option on your bench but if youve got a 5050 call like coner and xiao pedro which i do then using that bench is a consideration in case you missed it sackur is fine after his injury substitution last weekend he started in the champions league against atlanta which ended in a nilnil draw ri saved a penalty to clinch the point he saved four of the eight penalties that hes faced now by the way sterling came on for sacker at 7 3 minutes so sack is in line for a start against city slots revealed that allisons a doubt for gamei 5 reported hamstring tightness and hes going to be assess today now this ones a real headache as well cuz if youve got him its not definitive if youve got him keep an eye for some early team news tomorrow well be covering it as usual on the deadline stream so make sure you subscribe we have a good chance of knowing before the deadline if hes in the squad or not and if there is no news i think id just keep him in fact on that subject keep an eye for liverpool news in general just in case slot benches one of jos r diaz a gak played well in the champions league and slot said himself he would have started him in gamei four if not for his heavy involvement over the international break and hes been saying a lot of good things about darwin as well hes yet to get his first league start watkins came off early in the champions league as well and there were some fears of an injury but emry said hes working well he played well and i decided to change him like another player hes okay de bruy came off in the champions league as well with an injury in his case there were rumors that hes out for the game against arsenal he was asked in his press conference about katy b and he gave nothing away he said hes a bit better and he said theyve got training later and he was pressed on his involvement and he said he could be involved so i finishing up with my final team then its henerson in goal its trent dunk porro and coner in defense smith ro rogers sacka e salah in midfield and its harland up top on his own so as it stands ive bench sha pedro for cona now if theres any early team news that quansa starts and ill swap him in for coner instead salah captain harand vice the plan is to roll the transfer this week and then spend them both in game six or wild card and take those two free transfers over with to gami 7 sck is the only one on my team with an away fixture this week which is promising thanks for watching if this video was helpful hit subscribe well be live here for the deadline tomorrow as well see you then
