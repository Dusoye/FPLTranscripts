and we are live now fully live fully live okay heil cheaters welcome to the aam podcast my name is josh landon here with brandon k brandon how are you im good josh weve got a lot to talk about you coming off your wild card i think i had this idea that i like kick things off with a little holland talk but i feel like wed alienate like some very sensitive listeners right off the bat has the time come for everyone just to make peace with earling holland are we there yet its a weird week for it right because hes now on the itll be what it was nine goals in the first four matches and yet i am planning not to captain him this weekend in place of a player who blanked this last weekend so it is a little odd isnt it like i its its just a funny thing because i do feel like hes like break the premier league thank goodness arsenal won today just regardless of your thoughts on north lanta derby and like fandom aside right like feels like if arsenal lost that like the title might have already been i dont know people like hate when i say this its very interesting because its a its a real american versus british thing in my experience like americans we operate in a place of like this is like as a as sports fans at least like this is it funny because i feel like the british national character in general is ry very defe perhaps exactly sarcastic but when it comes to sports or sports as they say take off the ass theres a feeling like hope springs eternal and if i say stuff like the premier league is over four weeks in therell be people get extremely mad at me for saying that right whereas in america its like a thing you do right like the tigers was it a better example like a lions lost today right like this is what happened in nfl right so theyre one and one and so as like well seasons over were not were not a super bowl contender this year thats just the way you talk about sports and its youre trying to you have to go to the ex right right and to make yourself feel better you go to the extreme like maybe it is outlandish that im saying that the lion season is over maybe im overstating it therefore the lion season isnt over its a reverse jinx exactly and its its but its like not even in the moment i its not a conscious thing right i i hate the intentional reverse jinx i have been accused of this before on our twitter but to me it only the reverse jinx only works if youre truly not trying to do it right if you were if you were genuinely in a in a place of usually its like a place of anguish like fpl related anguish where youre like nope this is not going to happen theres im not going to get anything out of whatever ex player this week and then you get the glorious r like george castanza said it is its not a lie if you believe it exactly so thats where youre at with the reverse j all right so i think it was a very international breaky game week and i think just looking at the past completion of mosala is that post international break feeling in a nutshell it was it was crazy watching him and many other players in liverpools sabas li was having this issue as well and this was a very it was just a very underbaked performance by liverpool but credit to forest ana what probably for me had the best performance of the weekend he was unbelievably good in that liverpool match and at 44 suddenly im ana curious we talked about forest a little bit like right before the intern it was like our pod after gw three before the international break and about how we thought they could give liverpool a little bit of trouble this upcoming weekend just because theres theres a lot of quality on that like its like its a team thats for all of the they felt like they were like a proto chelsea a couple of years ago right where it was like they just kept adding more and more players to the squad but its like they shed the ones that didnt work and they found the a combination that does and there i think its quite a easy team to like now but i thought they but i agree i was surprised that sabas got the full 90 theres not like a fantastic replacement for maybe but i thought he was terrible i thought he had a like a poor match and the announcers felt that way too it was like i think ag everyone agrees not a great match no the real comedy of that match was diaz and joda both getting subbed at the same time and joda taking 10 seconds faster to get off the pitch which meant that joda got off the pitch at 5957 and diaz got off at 607 or whatever it was and it was like j had ordered an uber from the center circle was like i got to keep my festar rating and i cant keep this guy waiting it was brutal because you saw its its its such a fantasy moment because you saw the three players lined up right and when they showed them all line up and they said theyre theyre right by the the fifth official right and so its like its its going to come or fourth official whatever it is the official what is it is the fourth official yes fourth official right because you got the two linesmen would be two and three and then this the onfield red ref right see the this is the fifth official and what am i think like the fifth element i dont know where i am so fourth official theyre theyre lined up and so you see that and youre like okay and you already knew like sal is not leaving the pitch right its like its got to be its got to be joda and then youre like maybe diaz as well and then they i think they even announced so the announcers knew the change that so they knew what was happening then you see the ball in play right and so youre like all right we just need an extended stretch here where the ball doesnt go out of play little bit of head tennis maybe and it was like i its so funny i remember this so well from yesterday and it was like and i think forest got the ball and somebody on forest immediately uncorked like a 35 yard screamer that missed the net by 27 feet and and at that point it was like 3922 and i was like well like theres no theres no way were getting this like these guys had to be like at the extreme end of the pitch for this right very frau too because bradley was coming on and so there was an assumption that trent might be coming off clean sheet then he stays on and you must be thinking great we lock the clean sheet in i dont know i dont know about locking the clean sheet but certainly i was like at least i get more chances and like now i get trent feld right but no in the end he ended up with exactly one point he could have gone at 59 or he could have gone off at the end either way he ended up with a one pointer just a weird match from liverpool i it does feel like i was listening to like the totally football show like that and they were like the worry now is they were almost too good in the first three matches and it gave people a sense that they might be further along in the restarts or retooling whatever you want to call it with klo out and i think i its hard to say right because in some ways this team is fundamentally the same as last year right who is who would even be the kind like some players are more beted in but its even spas was there last year right i cant think of a single player in the starting lineup who was a new sign exactly so so i dont know its it the real issue for me and ive shared my screen here although while im on the transfers page for some reason i think i was just absent mindedly hitting buttons as i was talking to you i wild carded in all these liverpool players and and it just it just it didnt work out if i had just gotten the clean sheet i would have felt okay about it right but i did think trent had a pretty good game all things considered and he is in the zone clearly right now he had a great international break and there was a corner in which he went for goal he went for olympico and he was like well within his rights cu hes just so dialed in so as far as sh shelling out the money for trent you still have to feel pretty good about that i dont feel good about it because it didnt work out and i and i wild card out of a better team to so like sure i have these players now like maybe eventually theyll be good quickly run through the team for people listening no i think its fine i i have kaa stunk lost the clean sheet right away way trent got one point robinson lost it like what the 90th minute and 30 like 90 plus three like that it was like the like the last boot of the game lost his clean sheet henderson lo conceded two to lester awful performance it feels like lester are just gonna score one or two in every single match like i they might i honestly feel like unless they get a point penalty like a massive one i think theyre probably gonna end up staying up this year because theres just theyre just they just have enough like they can score goals i always this is just like my like my like rule of thumb which is that if you have a bunch of teams that are all near the bottom of the premier league table and like any one of those teams that theyre capable of scoring goals is going to be the team that stays up versus the the other ones well it aint southampton i can tell you that much no poor southampton its like they almost feel like an example of a team that got promoted like a year or two early its like they werent quite its like its sometimes it isnt good news to get its good news from like a bottom line standpoint but as a fan and honestly im not even from a bottom line standpoint you could argue that theres theres theres a case for waiting like trying to keep your powder dry like that right theres always the risk that you just dont ever get up right and that is the thats that so you always have to of course go go all out to get promoted but it does feel like there are times when its like you need to go to back down to the championship reset right like fulham we talked about this before but like fulham like it was like the third time was the charm with them right like and they seems like they have a lot of stability now its a real alchemy particularly when youre working with a lot of lone players and theres you have to have some level of continuity in addition to some elements of luck etc so i feel like when we looked at your wild card team when we did our patreon pod on thursday night i was struggling to find any issues with it i thought it looked strong in every position decent rotations no real weaknesses matt turner as your backup goalkeeper is the only guy whos probably not gonna get 90 in this in this lineup totally and i and i so i rolled out a 352 i got blanks from every one of my defenders my goalkeeper and every one of my midfielders an 0 for nine from those and one of my starting forwards didnt play jaa pedro and i lucked out because i definitely lucked out because johan wisa came on scored 24 seconds into the match got two bonus even though he subbed off in the 45th minute so so that feels like a stroke of good fortune and then of course i had holland and captain him so all told i wild carded and im down like 550000 spots so clearly a disaster but its like a house its like its like buy an old fixer upper i like the bones of this wild card its got good bones so i just need i just need it to turn into points eventually but its its a bummer im four weeks in now 15m overall and i think the worry now is this another season like last season where i feel like i like the team that ive put together and then every week it all goes right you just end up treading water exactly but its way too early to think that like i know i was talking earlier about being pessimistic i but i dont feel overly pessimistic i just rogers again its like another match rel looks good and but theres nothing happening with him its just its hes not i dont know its like if its if i dont know forgive me if im if im mentioning this again on the podcast but theres this tik tok feed i like where its all of these theyre all like french guys i think and they all take turns scoring like they all like its like they all do its like they all like its like a challen right and so itll be like a top bins and then itll be like two touch volley and if you get it you get a check mark if you dont get a whatever right and so these guys its like no one in the world is better at hitting the crossbar or the post than these guys right and its like theyre incredible at it occasionally they do go in but they are masters that accidentally like hitting the crossbar but getting so close and its like but its like theyre all just these dudes and its like kind almost feels like the difference between these tik to that guys as like the premier league guys like the premier league guys somehow know how to get it in and im just like its morgan like morgan rogers like if youre if you were capable of scoring you should have scored by now i dont know its like at some point like its its more than just bad luck right its like hes i dont know its like the gabriel jesus thing like do we is gabriel jesus on a 10year run of not being able to convert chances or is it just that hes not very good at scoring i dont know morgan rog is like to beat another metaphor to death feels a little bit more like when you first get the new fifa video game and your virtual pro is just has like no skills and you have to slowly build them up like morgan rogers like his aim was either directly at the goalkeeper or off to the side there was a great moment where he could have just teed up ali watkins for a tap in and the pass was just so off the mark so it had a one he he had a oneonone he couldnt convert weird match for watkins too he has the brace first goal he scored i thought was a good goal second one was i a bit lucky right it i think it takes a tough touch off the defender and loop straight into his path he almost cant he almost couldnt miss with the second goal and then but then he missed some like big chances and then d is it duran or duran duran duran comes on and and scores a great goal we a lot of great goals this whole weekend i was watching the highlights from the i had some play date related responsibilities st so i couldnt watch the the newcastle wolves game har barnes incredible but all three of the goals were great every single one of the goals scored in that match was fantastic because even the wolves goal was great because it had this great like a like dummy on the on the goal it was cool so so this is there was a question that we had for this weeks pod i think i had it down at the bottom but its jimmy ragd dog town asked what im enjoying about this fpl season so far and i would say again for me what i enjoy is watching the premier league and then fantasy is like the its like the thing that i sweat through in order to give its like i would say from a fantasy perspective i its more its like i dont know im not always having a great time from a fantasy perspective for me like watching the matches perspective i am almost always having fun like yesterday theres so much going on its very stimulating its fun and i and if i didnt have fantasy i would i just dont think id be was watching as much right its like i wouldnt be carving out the time for it and i but it does bring me a lot of joy watching these matches every day every weekend its a blast fpl is like somebody in a dark alley thats like hey buddy you like watching premier league well have you ever watched premier league like this exactly you ever smoke this and watch the watch the premier league exactly thats i think thats thats true from a from an actual fpl perspective this is a bad week for me to answer that question i think the thing i always love in fantasy like everybody i think is to have have players that nobody else owns who deliver and so i did have a little version of that i had johan vissa this week and ill take those seven points and and thatll be my little bit of joy this week for my own squad right is the visa bench boy so i will stop talking about my team now why dont you talk about yours because you its funny because i was thinking about this earlier today and how i was like im gonna say something to brandon its gonna sound insulting but i dont mean it this way or not completely at least but i think that you like this week was you showed the benefits of sitting on your hands right there are times when making no decision is the best decision right and i think thats something that you that you can first i was like did you get 70 points this week i was like d dang i ended on 55 points so you and i you and i talked on the main podt last week and you had triggered your wild card and i was like go with god thats not for me ive got my newcastle guys maybe ill get lucky with the north london derby then we talked on thursday and i was losing my nerve there was the international break injuries to odard to cl rice i was like what performance are we going to get out of arsenal this weekend conso had this little bit of a doubt even though he was past fit on friday and i just had this insane fomo not having a single liverpool guy so there was this inkling that i was as you said josh being passive so in fantasy you can be one of two things you can be patient or you can be passive and the difference is like patience is im trusting the plan that ive set forth and even though im going to be tested lets just carry it through and then theres paity where youre just not recognizing the situation that youre in you dont make the necessary changes and you get you get destroyed because of it and i was fearful that not getting any liverpool in particular was going to mean that i was managing passively so do you think its like an eye of the beholder thing one mans passive is another mans patience well its its a its a hindsight thing im able to say that it was patient because it worked out for me thats thats what leading from behind i think thats but now youve got now youve got two transfers and and you i think very likely i would say you ended up with a better squad by not making a wild card right like your wild card team would not have had 55 points would be my guess for sure no definitely not and like we had talked about i was thinking of going double liverpool defense so like i would have just been like destroyed when that when that clean sheet got wiped out so i do feel like im in a stronger position now i have to answer the question lingers of like well so what am i going to do with liverpool now i at least have the opportunity i doesnt look like the price market is going to be fluctuating too much this week while weve got these champions league fixtures that are starting and theres also the efl cup so guess im just looking for minutes rotation any injury concerns with liverpool with arsenal and all these guys whats up with saka y i cant believe they fl why whats the point of flagging saka anymore it will make a difference always being rolled off the that is a i dont want to get away from your team but ill just this a quick reminder that the european manch kickoff this week we have aston villa play on tuesday away to young boys at the wankdorf as we as we talked about last week wonderful and i think itll be very interesting to see whether watkins or duran starts that match i think i think we might see duran start it which would be good for watkins owners i think youd want him to start that match if watkins starts at midweek then i think we could see a duran start on the weekend and then liverpool also play on tuesday they go to ac milan so like you said well see what we see well see well see what we see but well i think i think the fact that its tuesday means that everyone should be fine i would love to see joda not start this match that would be ideal so well see there i was very i was leaning towards making the joda to to lis diaz move and was going back and forth but on friday and then i missed that diaz was set to price rise and its like i was like ah fine i was i was debating between the two anyways and the price rise i was like im not gonna spend the extra point one now when it was a lateral move i was okay with it so and then wednesday man city host lil and then thursday because theres no europa league or european conference league this week its all champions league its spread it over three days on thursday arsenal go to italy and they they visit at atlanta and so those are all again i have absolutely no idea how the scoring works this year in the champions league i dont know like theres even if theres if theres even a table like its not clear to me how many of this is going to work but but regardless theyre theyre playing and so i think this will be itll itll be a lot of fun just from like an individual game standpoint anyway so but brandon i want you to talk a little bit more about your team and while you do i am going to run and get a glass of water because i am a little part im going to give you im going to give you the free rain here for a second im going to vamp here all right go for it so the front line i felt like the edge that i might have is the newcastle away wolves say what you will about newcastles away form having the double up with gordon and esok felt good to me now there is a huge concern with esok hes now flagged in the game eddie how after the match said that esok mentioned he had blurry vision in the locker room at halftime and theyre not quite sure at least at the time of this pod whats going on with him and hopefully its not serious but its its very concerning and who knows what his fitness is going to be going into gw five so suddenly is esok to ali watkins is eso a make way to get cash to make it easier to get salah in and keep saka because right now the assumption with my team was always the only like the easiest way for me to get salah in is to get rid of saka and saka fitness prud is just in terrific form hes returned in every game we so far wed love to see a few more goals from him but i think theres no way i can drop him even though the man city fixture in gw five is worrying so josh this is this is i think a big piece of our looking ahead to gw five and potential transfers is can we just take the city arsenal match on the chin in recent memory its been nil very tetchy not highscoring i cant imagine holland has every chance of scoring in this match and arsenals performance in the north london derby was harrowing i thought i thought they worked their butts off yes and then they play on its i think theyre in a tough spot too playing away in italy on thursday maybe you talked about this while i was the schedule is brutal because then they play on sunday in the city match so artetas real challenge here is protecting some of his players who had to work hard in the north london derby cant imagine odard is fit for the city match because they had mentioned hes probably out for three weeks y at least theyll have delan rice back and watching the north london derby i thought if rice were on the pitch for arsenal that they would perhaps even have greater control maybe whats to discuss is whats going on with an ball and why has it just like not been working for the last six months i know and its its its just a weird thing with them because i continue to think they look good on the pitch and i cant tell if thats like if its just an aesthetic thing like i just enjoy watching this version of spurs play and yet youre right the results are not there right its like theyre theyre playing enoy enable brand of football i think but its just not like necessarily translated into a team that feels like theyre even remotely close to champion to challenging for a champion spot maybe when solani can level up i thought he had some moments in the in the derby where he he hasnt played in a few weeks right morgan rogers did up a little bit he did morgan rogers it a little bit thats true but my small moment of joy my whs a moment was emil smith row coming off of my bench with seven i had thought maybe benching j pedro in favor of smith row but thought i think its gonna be a tight between west ham and fulham it turned out to be the case but heck i will take it and as fantasy owners of jaia pedro youd love to see it not if youre a brighton fan but brighton couldnt they couldnt score goals hey we need jia pedro its j pedro team also classic premier league right the classic unannounced injury right just absolutely no obligation to ever i this is like my like my biggest bugaboo and i bring it up all the time but its just cra like why would anyone ever tell the truth why would a premier league manager ever like they could just go out there in a press conference on friday and be like osakas injured hes out for three weeks we celba wont play for us again theres no downside to that right like what is the what would be the like would you even get in trouble for that like you can say anything and theres no theres absolutely no obligation because no one tells the truth everyone hides all the all these injuries it happens again and again and so xiao pedro has a knock like no who knew not us so its a little tricky so what is your what is your plan right now then you have you have these two transfers so presumably youre not leaning towards a wild card at the moment because no no the plan the plan was prior to this game week that ill probably shift saka to salah and now i just feel like saka is immovable im just so enamored of his form and arsenal interesting so the plan is i think like the easiest move just based on like kneejerk is eso to watkins or the alternative would be i can do dogo jot to moala if i use my second free to move eso down to somebody whos 4 or im sorry 54 mil or cheaper is there anybody jamie vy okay thats interesting is you can get vardy for 54 he is 54 theres also ral himz who looks like hes won maybe its one match but i think against west ham he offered more than i think rodrigo mun has been offering at the start of the season so r gimenez is interesting but i bard is 56 by the way hes gone hes gone the wrong way hes as well he should he should have r it in price hes sublime song all of a sudden going the wrong way so can you can i see and well well say it out here because i dont again i dont want people listening to not know but im just curious what your squat no before you make any transfers im just curious what your team looks like whats your what does your bus team look like right now hit by a bus uhhuh my bus team looks like this im benching emil smith row who three flags so did you see this news about esok i was just talking about this while youre getting water but the blurry vision its worrying double vision its a was that song right like with my double vision at forer i think of im your huckleberry yes exactly kilmer and tombstone doc holliday so the plan the plan could be drop esok and get hins and then maybe roll another transfer the plan could be that double move i was mentioning where jot becomes salah and i downgrade eso but i think what i like i just im im liking having this flexibility up front with a m like a upper mid tier second forward that gives me like i wonder how youre feeling because you to go with the strong midfield you cant seamless easily get to a player like watkins that is true although its not its not impossible its two transfers so you have transfers and i and i would like to have him but im like okay with not having him just because of all the champions league stuff and the fact that he now has such a quality backup option what about another move so just looking at your squad i think your defense looks great right youve got kap poro and robinson back there henderson and go fine f whatever theyre all bad every keepers a bad except for except for ederson who gets us like he got his one assist a season so congrats to him for that sanchez for chelsea had a excellent game this weekend we dont need to talk about thats he did thats true credit to him he saved a pen and they kept a clean sheet although they shouldnt have kept a clean sheet i thought bournemouth were i thought unlucky in that one but they do they dominated for stretches for sure so good with the defense but then in the middle youve got you got rogers who at this point its just like whatever hes 5m like theres no point in getting too mad about a 5m player its the only joke is that we keep starting him in the face of these returns but like like you got smith row on the bench like i probably play smith r over i feel like thats pretty obvious im going to make that switch right now i agree your bus team had him on the bench last week so thats probably what it was i think in some ways the could you move gordon in down to a 45 fiveish player and then and then turn joda into into salah yes i believe i can do that i have 24 mil in the in the bank lets lets just try that for fun if i move jota to mo and i drop gordon how much do i have in the bank i have 46 so thats not bad its you could get a player who starts at least at 46 like not like just a straight up like someone who moved to saudi arabia and theyre just like theyre like red flag for the rest of the season this is the question different routes to salah is that what i need to do and well i feel like you cant let one that one performance against forest just put you off liverpool like we still have those first three matches in which they looked amazing as did salah just like if salah was able to complete a pass against forest he probably looking at some fantasy returns and i dont think were having this conversation so it does still feel urgent to me its a little bit like the holland thing like the non holland owners are now having to have like real talk of just like am i gonna persist with this strategy in the in the face of logic absolutely and i think the problem i was just thinking about your specific team part of the problem with those movies we just discussed is even if you made those you still have three flag players that would be starters right in ja pedro isach and saka now all three of them should start right but like youre like its like if you multiply 0 75 time 75 time its like youre started youre youre in a position where just somethings goingon to go wrong and its like do you want to like get rid of all of your cushion of bench players so i think i think its i dont know that and i can see why moving saka now maybe does make a little less sense because if you look at arsenals fixture run you can just survive gw five with saka right it turns into can you see this on my screen i can it turns into a a spectacular trio of fixtures right from game weeks 6 through eight where they host lester followed by southampton away to bour theyre almost too good where its like if it was someone besides saki youd worry about rotation but that artetta refuses to rotate saka so we should be fine with him and so like in my case my plan is to not make a transfer this week if i can avoid it right like barring some champions league injuries so that i can bring in saka myself starting in game week six and so in my case it would it would also be joda that i would be shipping out to fre cas for that its interesting whats going to happen in the midweek and the midweek is further complicated by the efl cup youve got everton southampton brenford fham palace man united brighton wolves and spurs all play in the efl cup midweek so have your antenna up for rotation injury etc and like youve youve pinpointed it with watkins is with duran and such good form how much of a transfer target is watkins if he starts and plays 90 in the champions league and i would be surprised if watkins doesnt start in the champions league because this is a dream moment for his career i think i think thats right its they its an interesting squad like are they part of me is like i think they probably are good enough like like are they deep enough to like because for a lot of squads that when you especially the champions league but even like the europa league for some teams right this happened to brighton a couple years ago where its like it can upend your season right because they just dont have the depth to rotate because theres just too many even when they try to rotate those can be matches that they then lose which means then you have to play everybody right and then suddenly youre playing your best 11 twice a week for on and off for three months right and thats when thats when your form comes to dip but i think they do have enough depth it just depends on the question is just how much is that even morgan rogers right like its not like theres no reason for us to think that hes so locked in that he couldnt get get rotated this coming weekend sure and its almost like him being left on for the full 90 against everton its like amry is like youre not part you could read youre part of the champions exactly lets lets lets hope i think all right so lets i wanted to because we had a proper game week where everything ended on sunday i wanted to quickly shout out the always cheating super

to take a quick survey about how you consume ad content with your podcast quick and easy and a chance to win 500 gift card so big thanks to bluewire for that all right josh game week five its time to put the disaster that was game week four in the past yes exactly im surprised that im not feeling more im feeling fine about how gw four went like it was not a good one but i dont know doesnt the i feel like the first game we after wild card its like you look at your squad going into the game week you always feel good about it and it never quite works out right and so sometimes its like its it takes two weeks for a wild card to like settle in and so i think thats thats thats how im feeling about things and i think when it comes to gw five the big question i i would say arguably the biggest question right because its its the place where you can get double points right is what do you do with liverpool and you and specifically mosala versus erland holland right so erland holland is i think masking some deficiencies in this man city squad right now like we started to get into the top of the pot and i think we got distracted but i it does feel like he is so good that its like its hard to even tell how good man city are its like its very clear how good erland holland is right and like because i felt like brenford had like they could have scored three goals in the first half of the match they not they were not pushovers in that match for sure not all a couple of crazy moments and i think by the end of the match brenford ran out of gas and thats the thing with city is they just have a deep bench and can keep their foot on the gas for the entire 90 minutes absolutely this is what unlimited money buys you and i think thats fine and were not going to get into that on this issues exactly but i do think from a fantasy standpoint the fact that theres one player who is so good that the flaws of their man city are when i say flawed that only in the sense that like they havent dropped a point this season and maybe there maybe theres a youre comparing them to the heights that they hit the last decade exactly it does not feel like they are it feels like they are maybe slightly lucky to be on 12 out of 12 to start the season and so and i hope and i worry a little bit now that with odard with odard out and arsenal playing away in italy on thursday man city play a home match in the champions league the day before against what i was probably an easier opponent as well in lil versus way atlanta i think atlantas gonna give them a arsenal tough match id be surprised if arsenal won that game and so i think that its its gonna be a tough so theyre going to be coming coming off of that and i think its going to be a real od pill battle for them does that translate into lots of returns from earland holland well i dont know about that right like i think that we saw with arsenal today in the north lond derby right like arsenal they know how to limit chances they know how to limit chances their defense is incredible david rya he had another spectacular save in this one and its just incredible like some of the best saves i have seen from a keeper like that the i thought the saveing thea derby and the saving the villa match just like the best saves the season and so like even so its like even though i also think like you just organizationally theyre strong its a stable back line the left back spot has had a lot of different people in there but but in general its like theyre just so solid and then that like you said before they have duckin rice back and so do i think the man that score in this match yes do i think they score more than two goals no right but i think they probably do score two and then if they score two then well if they score two then hollands going to hes going to score one of those two goals right and then maybe both and and so it feels like again i like to talk about these like floor ceiling things when it comes to captaincy right so the ceiling for holland i think would be around 13 points right two goals and three bonus thats just im just guessing but like thats like a reasonable rule of thumb i think heuristic brandon is thats what thats the thats what im going to use for this and but i think his floor its a blank i dont know it feels hard to believe doesnt it lets say i cant i refuse to give him that low of a floor im gonna give him a goal and no bonus so his floor is six points i would say his range is six is six to 13 roughly and then if we go to liverpool bounceback game clearly i cant imagine the play is poorly field again salah had by far his worst match the season he was irrelevant in the match just a weird one from him i dont like he wasnt creating chances for other people it was just one of those weird matches it was like one of those matches from last season where he just like he wasnt involved and i dont like im im sure he had a couple of moments but i watched all 90 minutes of that game and i dont remember i just dont remember seeing him like theres always moments when theyre in the box and things like that but it just didnt feel like he like took control of that game if anything i thought diaz was the one he had that amazing moment on the touchline where it looked like the ball was going to go out and he won the ball like maybe he should have passed it but when they when they showed the replay you can see hes got clear space near post right there and he puts it right off the post i agree exactly inside post too it was like it was my thoughts on solah in that match were particularly toward the end it felt like he was just trying to do it for him and mo is playing for mo and i think thats what has traditionally made mo such a special player as hes just like im going to do my thing and its gonna be great but y to be conspiratorial or read try to read too much into this performance is this a pivotal moment for arie slot and does he do some weird stuff does at doesnt the attitude change at li pool cuz arie doesnt strike me im im going to call him arie i think thats fine he doesnt strike me as a guy who puts up with bs and he hes trying to exert his this is the impression i get from his press conferences and the postmatch interviews the impression i got another great song turned into a great try to knock on wood more singing on the always anyway so i think arie slots in an interesting position here and how he resp response and its like good for liverpool and for slot that they have the champions league fixed year to shake that rust off deal with whatever thats thats a very youre right and that its interesting like in arsenals case you maybe dont want this match on thursday but in liverpools place in liverpools case they probably do want a chance like they want a big match right away right you want to g of get the taste of that forest match off of you so i think that makes sense and i think theyre going to look a lot stronger on tuesday i think the big question and the reason why everyone should be holding their transfers as long as possible this week is theres liverpool have made a couple of depth moves over the last like the last month or so of the season like do we do we see some of these players come on like theres some theres some quality players in that side who have like barely played so far this season right like like kesa has kesa gotten on the i think dont think maybe i was trying to like remember if like got the premier league at least i dont hes hes still in zero minutes so he joined late into the into the window too but so kesa has barely played darwin has barely played gakpo has barely played and these are quality cody geko is arguably like well he was in the i would say in the in the first 11 of best players in euro 2024 right he was absolutely fantastic he plays in the louis diaz spot i think when hes at his best right as a classif as a forward in the game but i think he plays i think hes i dont know i think hes very strong in the left he likes to come from deep right and hes hes a dutch player right so he can like hes he could play anything from center back to executive forward but you could see him i think starting in place of diaz or possibly joda midweek for sure it probably deserves to honestly darwin im not as sure about like would you roll out a darwin a darwin gakpo double front line im assuming that salid will start just because just i cant imagine him not starting this one sol is just so fit thats not a concern i have he will play 90 forever for eternity darwin does seem like nobody respects him at that club for maybe some of his teammates to but i dont think slot showing him a whole lot of respect i dont think hes going to get a start no darwins in that category remember that those french ticktockers i was telling you about before hes the ultimate man this guy would kill on there like the way the crossbar would rattle when he was trying to score in this these challenges my goodness hed knock it right off the tumble over backwards i would i would love to see that so i think so what is salahs range of returns this weekend i think his floor would be like five points like it be think he gets some like an assist maybe and i think his ceiling is pretty high honestly i think i think a couple goals and an assist and bon it like i do think that like thats a possibility like just i just think hes got a higher ceiling than holland does right this weekend and so i think so if the if the floors are roughly the same and the ceiling is probably a little bit higher if you have both of them i think that would i would tip towards captain inala over holland i dont think i dont think the argument is that strong like its not open and shut in my opinion right like given hollands like form like just given the form that hes in you can make a case that you can just cap him every single week and never said those exact words earlier in the week too exactly and i and i dont mind that i just think because i have salah it feels it just feels silly to me not to not to captain him for what is so clearly an easier fixture and hes capable of returning as much as as much as much as if not more than holland and so this is an interesting question i think for a lot of listeners who dont have both you when you triggered your wild card was there ever a moment in which you thought you would not have both salah and holland no and i wouldnt have wildcarded if i didnt want salah right like the salo was the inspiration for the wild card right so the question then is as we look at the captaincy for gw five if there are managers out there who dont have both holla holland lets call the lets call it like a like a c if they dont have the double up with holland and salah is this a problem going into gw five no i dont think so i dont know i think that like its not like a its not like a minus four minus8 like level i think if you can like in your case you can get there but not quite easily enough to probably justify it right like given the way you just explained it to me before sure im weakening my team in another position to get salah so the math is am i strengthening my team enough just by getting salah in that its worth weakening my third my second striker position honestly if you could if you could do it with like if you could if you could have still afforded vardy then i might have been like in favor of it because didnt you say that you needed you had like 54 available it made me that i just mis remembered how much vardy cost im going to try to make these just like see if i can make these transfers right now im going to bring vy in for eso yep and then well see if i can afford salo vardy is right there just below nico jackson 56 and jota i have now 127 in the budget and mr salah how much does he cost its got to be less than that right 12 126 he cost 127 exactly i have exact money and salah so i think thats thats im interested in it 100 and vy lester host everton as well so the problem is youre you have exact money but i would be reluctant to use two transfers before all of the champions league and efl cup matches this week right sure i dont want to do that either agree it may be a gordon downgrade situation in that case right thats true but i do think that i think that i think we should be probably talking a little more about vardy as a as like a third as a as a as a third forward option i just think that he is i thought he was i honestly thought he was watched and and now im not so sure i dont know like hes its like it doesnt feel like he should be able to keep it up right like hes 36 like that and hes but he is clearly the its like its like hes its hes like in one last ride territory right its like this is this is it this is like the hes 37 hell turn 38 this coming january so hell be 38 before the seasons outred its amazing right and so like but hes 37 hes got two goals it feels like he could have even more right its like hes hes just hes exactly the same player he always was right like give him half a chance and hes probably going to score and its like god like imagine if i dont keep i dont need to keep negging these guys imagine if morgan roggers and darwin were just able to hang out shadow like a work training program if they could just shadow b for a week just like ring their with so much red bull and skittles exactly thats true it might only work for him its its like that its like its like someones got like a weird style at like in your office right and its like theyre disorganized and they deliver youre like well it works for him exactly i dont like it but it works for him all right so i think that are there any other captain option se captain options besides besides those two maybe maa i think that you how much i love jo mcneel gold and assist this weekend whats the deal people are now like sniffing around everton how does that performance while the mcneil performance was strong no shots at him but what everton are doing this season is just a disaster class and i dont i dont think i could justify going near them well no i think it would just be the i having just wild card i have to say i was not tempted to have i me they do have a nice run i i gu dway mcneil is probably fine its just the problem is like dway mcneil is like a pretty what im im i forgot i was sharing my screen here but just out of curiosity ill pull up dwight mcneel here hes a pretty known commodity right its not like hes been around for many years now and this is what his if we count this like one minute that he played in 2018 lets not count that well just say one two three four five six this is now his seventh year in the premier league right so i dont know that hes necessarily like leveled up in terms of what we should expect from him going forward i should reset what i said there about everton because fantasy is not always about the scoreboard its not about the end result youd be happy to have dc youd be happy to have dght mcneel after this game week even though everton continue to drive off of a cliff so its its a little more nuanced when it comes to fantasy exactly i think thats the more and less weirdly so all right lets get to a couple questions here brandon mar b says which preseason hypes can we debunk now that were 10 into this season got are we 10 into the season we are he says im looking at you guys barco well barco left so i think gordon what do we think is the gordon hype i think like if i were gordon owner as yourself included must be looking to hit the eject button there right its not been fun there was an interesting moment though when and shout out to our friend run in the youtube chat who mentioned that iso got a poke in the eye at the very end of the first half so that i have something to do with the injury but when esok came off at halftime anthony gordon was moved into the number nine slot he was playing forward and thats so the appeal is that if eso continues to not be able to see we might get we might get something out of out of i dont know i dont i its an interesting one gordon could go off like hes he has leveled up in the way that mcneel hasnt necessarily leveled up i do think when gordon got that move from everton to newcastle everyone was like okay but i dont understand this and hes risen to the occasion hes putting great tot for england so but the the fantasy returns have been garbage and that is very frustrating mean it does make me look at man utd as well that they were much hyped like coming into the season thinking ah theyre theyre making some interesting like smart signings for once and that del came in and look very feisty this weekend but still they cant theyre theyre struggling to score goals and be at that like top six level squad so i think like we can definitely debunk any like bruno garnacho cant even get a start i think the encouraging thing from a manett fan perspective is at least theyre like they are integrating a lot of players that are interesting and young and like i think as frustrating as its it must be for them right now like its i think theres a lot of i dont know like there its funny because i was talking earlier about how theres like i would say the manata fans are the ones who are who do embrace the pessimism like more than anybody else i think i think the first the first like 10 years post ferguson there was a lot of hope and then recently theyre like h like i dont know i dont know anymore i guesso is that like optimistic player for united right now and as a fantasy pick interesting there like theres just no one like more than morgan rogers is he well everybody is he has like m r has no returns so far in this season i think kobe minu i think is again not a player like im recommending but like hes because he hasnt he might be like a little too deep but like hes a hes a good player as well and like so i dont know like i dont know but anyway i dont think theres anything we dont need to name gu why did we start talking about man united exactly all right so es isan is quality like its just that i dont know like i him like i dont think hes overhyped or anything like that its like id be very surprised if by the end of the season you didnt have 20 goals right very close to it just not worked out for newcastle game week one got that ridiculous red card against baron diaz and that southton match ended up being like not a big fantasy affair and then isach comes off with this freak poke in the eye situation against wolves so its been we just havent gotten the right scenario for esi thus far amazing for sh to come out and what a season for him so i think that its i think i dont think like hes overhyped i just think like it hasnt worked out with him i certainly feel more confident in isach than i do in gordon lets see who else is in aars list gardial didnt even start this weekend probably like i dont know im not sure if that was a if that was like well its still hard to say because rodry didnt start either right and so i feel like we still dont know whats whats going on there i i was surprised to see lewis start over him and the left back spot but its just like the whole thing im just like i dont exactly i dont want any part of anyone that isnt that isnt holland on that squad unfortunately even ederson if ederson were 45m sure right but but hes never gonna be anywhere close to that jeep lets see who else munos well sadly muno so for him unfortunately could turn around of course but not looking great then the roll him and a score too so its like its even its a little scary there for him gayi i almost put him in the esok camp where its like gay is a good player and he has been a totally reasonable perfectly fine fourth defender in fantasy in the past right and thats where i would still put him like hes what is going on with the palace team and the palace defense i dont know why did they let their why did they let like a bunch of the best players go brandon like riddle me that and like why and a center back like right before the season started they were just so fun there was there its like that buccaneering aspect of them under glassner seems to have gone away weirdly will it come back i dont know its hard to say it we kept thinking it would with derby remember brighton and and never did so i dont know well see and then kaa i dont know what to say about that its i think ever asille is midfield is onana has had some stellar moments and hes a great player but i think theyve got a lot of work to still do in order to control of the games and i wasnt impressed with the midfield during that that match this weekend against everton this was this was the worry right is when douglas lise left that it was going to make them like a little less like rock solid to the middle theyve gotten away with it more or less so far they did lose at home to arsenal but but conceding two in the first half to ever they just seemed a little i dont know if incipit is the right word just like just like weak to put it in the simeone terms of like no coones from this side this weekend i dont know they did come back and win though so give credit where its due everybody its everybody spots everton two goals because they know that the next three are coming this make this fun for everybody the pattern for everyone this season all right so we talked about jimmys question about things youre enjoying fpl so far i like the way we ended up on that question though which is try to find one thing its like one fantasy thing each week one thing that brought you a little bit of joy john clovis says well okay here we go this is a another newcastle question this is where a lot of people are though right because l people went heavy on newcastle and the reason i added this though was because of his what he was asking at the end says i went heavy on newcastle with burn gordon esok but none have been that great i think thats true like weve had a couple of returns from from everybody but with a hard fixture coming up do i need to sell them all and suck up a minus eight so the reason i added this brand was because to me my feeling is if youre considered a minus eight this far into the season and you still have your wild card i would go ahead and just play the wild card i dont like especially because game week seven makes a lot of s or gameing six makes a lot of sense for wild cards already i would just do it a week early and i think its fine and i think theres i do think that like theres a very good chance that saka gets some return this weekend right he has every single game we so far this season and theres no reason for to think that he wouldnt right i me hes gonna play the full 90 most likely unless its a blood bath and i love that and so and if arsenal are gonna do something hes proba going to be at the center of it right so but with a triple newcastle i find just like getting rid of them like andy defra and sha shank redemption style like dropping little pebbles little grapp yard a little bit of time i think that makes sense just one guy in the yard bits here and there i think thats right i think i think i think im inclined to agree with that u so yes i think its i think that i think im with you there i would not drop them all and if you decided that you and also like the fullam match is not great but its not a horrible match like i think a pretty good chance they score like who do you think is a better start this weekend i think i know the answer but ill get anyway anthony robinson at home or william celba gabriel away to man city its robinson because hes just getting so far forward and being a part of the attack whereas we know what were getting with cba so does feel like celba is banging on for a twopointer this weekend feels like both are going to concede but totally theres something about a little bit more fun well it depends on your taste if you if you enjoy like imperious headers and a wellkept you high line or go with cba if you like marauding left backs go of robinson i brought in i i brought ip switchs greaves in on my wild card the only the only defender who got a return but of course he was third on my bench this week and so would you start i dont i dont think ill do this but it would be tempting to start him over both of those players and they because if swit play away to southampton and that match has some strong nilnil vibes to it doesnt it would i do it i dont know if i would but i will say it does sound fun to if youre not g to play greaves in this match and you dont have a player like gaves because youre ever going to play him right but four million fifth defender but its not bad if they were home if they were hosting southampton hed be an auto start i think this week the thing with southampton though like ramsdale doesnt have a reputation for being great in the air plus jack stevens got a dumb red card like the southampton defense is a bit weakened i wonder if greaves is a good shout for a setpiece goal against well and whats whats fun is they i dont know i dont know if everybody knows this but one thing they do in the premier league is its a its a full when they reverse the fixtures of the second half of the season every fixture in a game week is the fixture they play in the reverse fixture so i know brandon that there will be a week when arsenal and man city play where ip switch will be hosting southampton so i will have my chance to start greaves over my arsenal i love that youre committing right here on this episode of im going have just to just to just st true to my word here it all right well lets lets wrap things up with a couple final thoughts brandon how about this if you could only watch one match this weekend what match would that be spurs brenford feels like a fun one these are like you pulled that one out of a hat like thats a shocking answer i dont know like its its fun to bag on spurs and theyve got their issues but they have so many good players and when theyre playing well they can be fun and the same could be said of brenford now im curious about brenford because momo is also on my short list of players to get in the next few weeks and he like similar to anthony gordon was moving central after visa came off the halftime so what how does zomo fit into a visa liss brenford and then youve also got fabio carvalo whos not seen a ton of minutes and is a interesting attacking player for brenford and i so theres a lot of scouting to do in this match okay all right youve convinced me that theres theres theres theres something there i think the west ham chelsea match i think could be interesting just because west ham have theyre not its not like even a fantasy thing but im just interested in how this match shakes out its a little bit of a its its a its a its a south london derby in a way theyre theyre not that far from each other we u you and i saw west ham and chelsea when we were in london last time what chelse are west london by the letter of the law im sure theres a fair enough animosity there some energy people are like throwing things at the their phone right now as they as they hear that but but i think i think crystal palace main united could be a fun one that is the final match on saturday it is the 12 us 530 uk match i think that genuinely a difficult match to handicap i would say right i think a lot of results are on the table here like i that feels like the match that could absolutely like a neil nil does not feel on the table like it feels like a 32 one way or the other feels very possible in this one unfortunately for us dean henderson owners but i think maybe e does something i think interesting like the there was some drama about penalties with e and mateta but then was class trying to and mata was like this is my pen and and then they scored so its hard to argue with the result but but it was a little bit of drama there and so i dont know it feels like maybe i dont know i just i it feels like sa is one of those players whos due for like a big explosion and so maybe it in this match i think itll be a fun one though and you have man city host in arsenal on sunday but whats the fun in picking that as our one like thats the ob i feel like whenever we say one match to watch this weekend there is the completely obvious match and then theres the other like the fun other ones and the fun other ones are why you do fantasy at all right its like we were talking about earlier if you didnt play fantasy you would probably find a reason to say yes to that lunch plan with your spouse right but because of fantasy you can be like im sorry ive got to ive got to see whether whe sellur partk can be a fortress on on saturday my wife asked me the we were out having dinner this weekend and she was like so like you watch like you try to watch all the games im like i love it shes like you love it im like its like my favorite thing to do and she was she was like flabbergast and just like wow thats a thing that you just like love doing like 10 years doing this does she think you like that you just like the like the like tiny amount of like ad revenue that we get from its just part of totally mercenary this is a true labor of love this thats why you should be supporting the podcast on patreon by the way patreoncom always cheating to support this this quick sotic labor of love that is this podcast so all right i think i think we get in things there brandon if i had to we can do the ex dog at him to which player do i think has that dog in him this week okay ive got a good one leaf davis the leaf inator mr assist himself the leaf blower the leaf blower i think that he blows his way into some attacking return away to southampton i know i said this well lets just say return because i did say that nil was on the table there so i think i think the floor for lea davis is five points on on saturday im going with inku i think inuko i think he starts i think hes going to demand minutes just like that was such a well taken goal and the entry pass from sancha was great too so i like the looks of him against w its funny its like you can see maybe its its like a its like a soup de version of the u the forest thing we were talking about before its like you can see a version of this team thats good its just like whether they can the real question is whether they can shed the people who are its not working for right like the which they have done right like m seems like m played his last match played but like it started at least know i think mesas got the right attitude just in terms of just making hard decisions and being unafraid of being a jerk about it so i could see it happening for them this season all right do you have an ex dog and him for for game week five were going with were going with in cucko right im sorry you said that already y sorry about that i dont i dont want to go back on that pick be funny if you forgot you said that like i forgot you said it and you just came with a brand new one like on the spot that would have been would i was also
