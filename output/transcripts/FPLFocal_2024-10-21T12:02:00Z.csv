welcome back for another video a roller coaster weekend of football for gaming a weve got monday nights games left to play at the time of recording were going to discuss the best players to buy moving forward using projection data from fb review lets start with the keepers so at the time of recording theres been 33 clean sheets this season at this stage last season there were 35 and last season there was an unusually large decrease in clean sheets and a significant increase in goals scored perhaps a signed to reduce what were spending at the back and shift the funds to midfielders and forwards next gameing edisons top of the keeper projections was city playing home to southampton has scored just six times from eight gamings this season so if youre in need of a keeper or a defender even sit your wor a look rys bottom of the table this week with 35 points however if we look at the next five game we projections r still top among all the keepers has the arsal defense gotten worse though its possible with three red cards its hard to draw conclusions as the context is important of data arsenals 92 expected goals considered ranked sixth best currently they were top last season although hes not a defender erard has been a huge miss as he still puts in a defensive shift of his pressing his leadership i think arteta has got the midfield balance a bit wrong especially against bournemouth even before the red with rice partying marino playing we might even see naner start the next game the good news is ards potentially only two or three game weeks away from returning which could have a big effect all around in the team if youre looking for a cheaper keeper then fen stands out hes home to ip switch this game and after that hes got fil and bor of everton and leicester len also looks good but an extra not 5 mil phams next for everton brenford palace and walls the keepers have been pretty unpredictable so far im not sure anyone expected anal to be the top scoring keeper after eight game weeks everything considered though if i was won this week i think id still pick ry with a longer term view as a reminder this week theres european football before gameing n so hold those transfers before you lock in arsenal villa city liverpool chelsey man united and spurs all play again before next deadline moving on to the defenders given the unbelievable fixture for city their defenders are all over the table this week viio wangji ruben and lewis its sensible to avoid the likes of aangi and ruben diaz theyve not started every game and aangi was benched on the weekend stone started and he did score at least of lisis and vardo theres more upside theres no guarantees theyll start every game either especially in a fure like southampton home where pep might fancy given a game especially if vardal starts midweek in the champions league but might not happen ak was back on the bench in game me a vardal still a very good pick this week though and hes probably likely to start than not but its impossible to predict pep we expected foden to start in kdbs absence and he didnt for example so dunc is second on the table this week playing home to wolves it is worth noting that after wolves they way to liverpool and then home to man city so avoid him if he need a defender for those weeks as well brians fixes are amazing from gamei 13 which looks like the perfect time to buy in pennick now got two goals in two games and he makes the table this week with 37 points home to ip switch pin collins are the better alter to dunk if you need a cheap defender that you can keep playing after this game after it switch its full and bour of everton and leicester venburg for four ms now started five games in a row as well pin and collins are completely nailed which is what you get for the extra 5 mil vanderberg could be as well but frank does have options in fullback so arsenal home to liverpool no arsenal defenders on the table this week for the first time in a while but theyre going to b so be about civo picked up that red card against bournemouth aleta says its going to be left up to the club if they appeal the cba red card cuz they need to compare it to similar incidents youd imagine if they do appeal he wont get rescinded so davis is someone that we talked about last game we he second after trent for expected goal involvement this season with 191 xgi among defenders the problem is ap switch arent a solid defense so youre going to be counting on attack and returns more often the not when they concede and further to that now greaves and to anabia out injured its okay to start for the next couple but wouldnt look to buy him now on to the midfielders and this week palmers top with 67 points followed by foden with 6 6 if he starts and then bumo 64 chelsea are playing newcastle home which is going to be an interesting watch trepp still sideline of injury newcastle vis stanford bridge after 1nil home loss to brighton oddly enough newcastle have conceded just eight times this season which ranks third best of course they have had isak out for a couple of games which hasnt helped at the other end of the pitch he was back in the team on the weekend anyway palmer salah sacka harand son the five premiums theyve all hauled multiple times this season but inconsistently its impossible to own them all three seems to be the sensible maximum without hurting the team balance too much its also impossible to time owning them at the perfect time so sticking with the ones you pick could be the sensible player and just be patient for example going sacka to palmer after palmers 25p pointer meant that you missed those points the week before but then you also missed sacka 16p pointer that all said its a bit easier to make the case of selling when theres an injury doubt or a notable fixture swing lets see if sacka is involved in the champions league midweek for arsenal it was a bit of a surprise to see him not make the squad after what carls and aleta both had to say but perhaps aleta being positive was a sign that we should have paid attention to is anyone taking a chance on foding this week its one of the best fixures youll see all season city home to southampton hes only started once which is concerning this season hes a risk tolerance pick his predicted minutes will be low if you got the appetite for some risk the upside is massive for him so bruno was finally back among the points itll be just an assist last game given what a volatile gamei it was for many a fivepointer was whole though we talked about him in last weeks videos as he did make the table then as well hes back on it this week with 48 points man uniteds next five features are pretty solid west ham chelsea leicester ipswitch neverton is anyone tempted for 82 mil so if we dont get a positive update on sacka who are the best replacements well palmers a logical pick only salahs got more projected points for the next five gamees among midfielders son and boom also excellent choices or as we say foden if you want to take on that risk if youre looking for a cheaper midfielder this week the two players that i like are seeno and rogers both playing one another so meno took six shots against arsenal hes a way villain then hes got man city so its not the perfect entry point but longterm the fixures are great and he should come good rogers is home to bournemouth and then hes way to spurs and liverpool before hes got palace home if you want to under the radar but excellent pick they look no further than garo he scored against brenford on the weekend he took maxima bonus he took eight shots that game which was the highest on the weekend of all the fixtures only 62 mil and hes played 90 minutes the p four games in a row bon not has been quietly brilliant lately as well not seen his name mentioned much hes 5 mil and hes got three goals two assists this season including returns in his last three games in a row right now id still lean towards rogers for about the same price the two do have pretty comparable fixtures but vill a far better team bonon nots run if youre interested is forest ips switch man united chelsea and brenford his 151 expected go of was the highest of all players in the weekend as well 134 without expected goals from five shots tak can three in the box moving on to the forwards and harlands an absolute mile in front this week with 89 projected points watkins is next closest to 53 holland started the season almost incomprehensibly well with 10 goals in five games but hes now blanked three games in a row despite the blanks hes got to be the clear favorite for captaincy though such a great fixture i wonder if anys going to be tempted to activate the triple captainship even whether those blanks were enough to deter it a hatrick against newly promoted i switch back in game two and he followed up with another hatrick against west ham in gamei 3 isach could be a left field shout soon in a couple of gimicks time if he can impress in gamei 9 and 10 hes got chelsea and then arsenal before a solid run of games for now salanki is second after harland for projected points for the next five somewhat predictably watkins has continued delivering this season hes got five goals two assists for seven returns and eight we did see ralison back in the team which did see salanki off 18 minutes we also saw watkins come off for 74 minutes last match for duran so its a shame their minutes arent quite as good this season due to the death so its a shame their minutes arent quite as good as wed hoped especially given how many late goals we seem to be getting this season and i recall last season as well forest are away to leicester for gameing n which has got wood on 44 points vardy on 43 everton are going to be home to fulham calvin le on 43 projected points for that one let us know in the comments what your transfer plans are this week and how youre getting on thanks for watching as always see you soon for the next one
