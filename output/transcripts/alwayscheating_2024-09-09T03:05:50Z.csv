hi and welcome to ikea how can i help my schedule is crazy i just want some me time maybe its time to embrace the joy of staying in with comfortable beds pillow and decor mood lighting and so much more you can turn your bedroom into the place to be sounds like a dream weve got you visit us in store or at ikeausacom sleep to create your dream bedroom today hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you great what this is like a mini feeling im having of coming back from a summer break international has just been the drums here so im excited to get back to where we left off like this is a cliffhanger resolution you triggered your wild card on last weeks pod and we need to know what changed where your strategies at and also whats been going on with these national team matches the whole country of ireland has gone into hiding after declan rice and jack relish did some dirty deeds to im so comm commiserations to the irish for sure but how are how are you feeling vibe check josh well the vibes the vibes are good i feel like i checked out for a few now last week when we did our you should go back and listen to last weeks pod if you havent listened to it yet because i think its a evergreen pod we talked about big picture takes on all 20 premier league clubs covered a lot there and then i revealed i hadnt told you this before the that i had activated my wild card and so we went through that of course ive changed a lot since then i feel like its still in flux and i screwed up because they made the classic wild card problem of you ever tinkered on a wild card and you took a player out as part of a tinker and then you confirmed and then you realized that player had gone up 01 without realizing it happened with money okay chris wood so you lost whatever money you made on him were you ever going to has he increased in price since you did that he went a point won and so hes hes back in the squad ill ill ill share the updated team with you it did force a this is the problem is point one is so crucial when it comes to wild card decisions right theres a cascading effect here so i think its been a very the premier league i this first international break is a toughy i feel like right because you have theres a lot going on in the sports calendar like the premier league needs to compete in that world right you had the wimbledon or not wimbledon you had the us open final m college football some people would have watched the woody allen film wimbledon perhaps with no premier league on sure is that what its called is it no its like match point right there is a movie called wimbledon with kristen dunst and paul betney yes thats the one im thinking up theres also challengers which i saw twice in the theater thats how much i love challengers thats i watched it on my tv and it was it was fine i think a lot of rules were broken in that last point but we could save that for another time well never know we never saw what happened after after the leap the big leap at the end all right well lets so international break i would say in general when it comes to how i assess the international break is i dont pay too much attention to returns right maybe if there was like a super out of form player who starts to play well then that might change things a little bit perhaps has scored a a brace for sweden so and its like do we should that matter i dont know right its like its its nice were looking for any clues were in like hyper this is the this is the beginning of the season its the beginning of the detective movie everyones a suspect and weve got to look under every rock here abs absolutely and turn every page right its the old robert caro robert gly whatever author and editor speaking of good films the documentary with them is pretty good so i think trent had a man of the match performance was it yesterday for england and lets see what else bruno scored today but again these the i just dont think these are super relevant bruno was bruno has been playing fine he just hasnt been getting any like actual fpl returns right so so its like doesnt matter what he does in the oral stage i dont know the same with with newcastle like im not has eso scored in gw three too so its like does it change how i feel but im not exactly right im still looking more like at fixtures i would say with newcastle the biggest piece of news was joe pedro getting called up for brazil right as an injury replacement brazil plays their final i think it is it is just friendly its wednesday but i cant remember if theres like proper stakes for that match or not im not sure that j pedro would be expected to start that one anyway but hes certainly hes traveling for it right ive got the foot mob open and theres theres no real indication that it is a match with stakes well well get back to you all on that one this is something that i have like recently i ive like become a world cup europa league like a cup person where its like if theres like a proper cup im going to watch it im all in but just like random friendlies thats a pretty high bar for me these days like its got to be a like are you watching lots of friendlies like the even the england or like the american one until pch is there like what am i watching for like what am i it is it is just to interject just so were putting out the right information it is a world cup qualifier for common ball and its tuesday evening that brazil plays paraguay got it so you had the day and the stakes completely wrong so but we fixed it we fixed it thats true we got that did i did make a point of watching the us canada match on saturday mostly just be i hate watched because jesse marsh has just what a fall from grace since he left leeds hes just been unable to find a home he took he took canada to the semifinals of the copa america as good as its going to get for that for that guy i can tell you i can tell you this are you were just not aligned anymore its whether its the movie challengers or jesse marshs career there are there are always interesting threads for sure going back to the opening of ireland hosting england thats always just a contentious rivalry and then youve got the the expats and jack and dean doing the business theres always something interesting and ill watch im im just like a sicko ill just watch it watching any soccer match right no and i respect that i just there something the you the nations league stuff was like some like sea change moment for me where i was like now theyre going to try to turn like friendlies into like a cup and it just i was like i cant this is like they have gone down a road i cant follow its so you go down that road and you tell me what the view looks like and ill report back its the same view ill tell you that its the same view nothing has changed all right so anyway we there was a johnny fleets asked if the if the what is the tail number of ja ped return flight and will be monitor monitoring and live tweeting its progress its like one of those coaching searches where like youre looking for private jets and things like that like i to me now that i know that matches on tuesday i would say im not especially concerned about je pedro ahead of its not if they played on friday maybe that would be one thing but its they play on saturday hes a its not like hes going to rack up 180 minutes for brazil right and i think its fine hell have a late tuesday or early wednesday flight right and presumably hes done the brazil to england flight many times in his life right so i dont know what the like why that would be devastating for him like i can see like if youre going to like australia like that right if youre crossing they are crossing a hemisphere i dont know like i im just not that worried about it are you worried about ja pedro im not worried about it mostly because we have gone in on ja pedro mostly for the ripple effect across the rest of our fantasy team he is the right price and hes in good form most of us bought ja pedro for budgetary reasons not because we need him to bang against i switch home i switch home is a terrific fixture and i would prefer to get 90 minutes from j pedro in that fixture annoying one to miss out on right yes it would be annoying nonetheless he has been a long a midterm lets call him buy so if we only get 30 minutes out of him against ipswitch so be it i think thats a good philosop ultimately theres theres only so much control that we have over these things so i think its probably the right approach to take there i think we will probably get some update late this week right either something from the press conference in terms of like training ground photos and things like that right like if he if he doesnt even train with brighton on friday sure time to get worried right but i think otherwise youre probably fine and eric asked if we overact overreact to international travel and rason probably i think it there have been times like a couple of years ago when you had this after co there was a lot of chaos when it came to like qualifying matches right and they were trying to squeeze like three fixtures into some of these international breaks right and so you had matches that would end thursday evening and then the club would have a match like saturday morning or like like a the noon match on saturday and and in those cases it what it was appropriate to over like to react to that because you often the player often either wouldnt start even play right so i think that like there are times when its a real thing but i would say anything that most the normal international window ends on a tuesday right like in the like barring anything chaotic so usually the players are back theyve got a couple days to adjust and usually its fine and i feel the same way about injuries right like youre always going to get some of these like minor premier league injuries like cole palmer right now is flagged and i like i to me those are almost never a thing right like if a player suddenly gets a minor injury like a day before everyones about to leave for international break that usually just means theyre trying to give them extra rest they would want extra rest and youre in a hard situation there where a you wouldnt want to decline an invitation to play for your country but also publicly you cant decline so its in everyones best interest to make up some story that is defendable so cole palmer injury this is just how its going to go i havent seen any that scream out to me like dear this is like a real warning flag all right let me ask you a question and this will be the last international break question before we move on to fpl proper what is the point of having harry kane start for england this weekend why was he starting like what like hes like a mid3 forward he is he is the most known commodity of all known commodities i know they have a new manager but its like isnt this a great time to give some new player like a run up front like i dont i dont quite get that i think you underestimate the amount of power harry kane has in this situation you think he wants to he like hes pushing for a start there 100 he wants to keep the minutes hang on to that talisman thing as long as he can okay thats fair and im looking at who else would have it was like a light on forwards now that im looking at the squad right like they they like the subs were like e bowen was technically his sub so maybe they were just a little short on forwards this time around and olly watkins i think given how few minutes hes playing for aston villa right now and hes not quite hit his stride i dont think he would have wanted to play those minutes necessarily its more important for him to get ready for the champions league thats true by the way i did get tricked by a fake faio romano twitter feed earlier today that indicated that marcus rashford was signing a deal to go to a middle eastern club the photoshop was that convincing that you got tricked it was like it was like fabo like it was how it is its like sometimes you want these things to be true right because it would be hilarious and so its like your immediate response is like my god i love it and then and then the more rational part of your brain takes everything like wait a second no one else is reporting on this i wonder if its like cameo now with fabito romano like could we just reach out to him and paypal him like 200 euro and he could post whatever news we asked him to much like you would do with cameo that is a great thing that is how he doesnt seem to have a job right outside of tweeting so like i think he probably is available for hire right like we could you imagine if we just paid him to like to tweet about our podcast if thats possible im sure it is im sure it is all right u next week keep an eye for fab rano tweeting out our latest episode we go always exactly we wont reveal how much how much we had to fork over to make that happen all right so couple other quick news and note updates i thought this was interesting cole palmer is not in chelseas european conference league squad which like im just a little surprised i dont know that he was going to get any starts for them but but its its a very good thing from an fpl perspective if youre looking at for sure thats thats like the level of certainty that every fantasy manager wants i suspect they can submit a different squad once they move into the next stage of right i believe thats how it works in january they which presumably they will right they can field jaden sanchos got to play somewhere right so im sure theyll get what a lad uhhuh its crazy right you sterling at arsenal jaden soncho at chelsea its so bizarre it is i will see if chelsea can even get to the next phase of that competition who knows what version of chelsea shows up week to week absolutely but i thought that was a that was probably ultimately good news for chelsea they dont need him get mixed up in that so and then might hes flagged at on the site right now but i think its a fairly i just i did a little bit of searching right i didnt see any real reporting on him having any like serious issues so he should be fine b dinary reports groin sl hiip pelvic injury so its all in that bathing suit area for mr couple other updates jared branway set to return to full training this week now this i at first glance youre like why is this even relevant at all but there are a number of defenders that are shockingly cheap for everton and if theyre able to eventually turn it around a lot of people will be looking at some of these players on their wild cards and even for myself im i i have michael linko in my team right now and hes not like im not planning to start him but 44 hes 44 exactly you have michael keane at 4m too although now im scared to have him with br r set i think hes must be immediately out once bran way is back interesting i like that certainly can it go on forever what you saw from everton toward the middle and definitely by the end of the season was a team that their table position was betrayed by the points deduction that the club had to take the d had them doing what he wanted and playing well decently enough and specifically defensively and a lot of that was to do with how well branway was playing so i agree i think coming back is an interesting fantasy wrinkle and i i dont know how long it might its like hes just returning to training but hes been out for months so i dont know how long itll take before hes back in the squad but i just i i feel like it sounds like d is not like i think hes got a ways to go before he gets sacked right i think hes going to be safe for a little while so and so i think i dont know i just i just assume still like and despite what weve seen so far that hes going to figure out how to turn this thing around maybe im like the last person who still thinks that but i dont disagree with you at all and i think everton have bigger issues to solve than d exactly their issue is that they cant spend any money without like without getting more points deducted and so theyre stuck with what theyve got right the one final news and note update i like this little maybe we start doing news and notes at the top and its very handy i think to go through the news of the day its like ive got a got a little newspaper feel like im watching morning joe right now exactly i remember james richardson used to do this ac jimbo like hed do these like whats in the paper remember that he italian 90 well that well that but also i feel like it was like maybe it was like for one of the world cups he had like a big stack of newspapers videos back when he did the guardian football podcast exactly final piece of news is that european matches kickoff this week it has been very hard to follow whats going on cuz they they like just announced the fixtures a few days ago it must be like crazy booking these flights too right now that everythings announced like a week in advance and theyre mostly private jets but you still got to reserve a a like a runway at the airport and stuff right fans the fans too you want the fans the fans are irrelevant right like they no one cares about them at all sure the beer sales in the concourse is just a grain of sand compared to all the broadcast rights everything exactly theyre like youll just do whatever we tell you to do and so but there are so first things there are no europa or conference league matches until late september which i somehow didnt realize until earlier today that there its its like a lean in on the champions league itself until for the first couple weeks and so tuesday wednesday and thursday we have champions league matches and for all of my like this is so wacky the way that theyre doing it this year it is fun to see all these matches like villa play at young boys my favorite one of my favorite team names and one of my favorite stadium names brandon because its its the wankdorf stadium and so young i love that young boys play at the wankdorf so thats where will be on tuesday and then liverpool also will play on tuesday in the champions league they travel to ac so another interesting match wednesday man city who always have a great every year now in the champions like they have this amazing amazing like easy run they host lil on wednesday so that be a great chance to play the play their squad players and and then third like i maybe theyll im sure holland will start that match but and then thursday arsenal go to italy and theyll play atlanta and i think thats a dangerous match for arsenal possible banana peel type match for sure and thats not it were going to be in a football coma by the time gw four gets here because efl cup is also on tuesday and wednesday everton host southampton wow brenford play leighton orient fulham away preston palace away qpr man utd host barnesley on wednesday spurs are away coventry my god brighton host wolves madness good well im glad i checked out for a few days just so i can check back in so because i frontloaded my international break i spent a lot of time on sunday and monday doing wild card related stuff and i been and then i tuned out for a few days i had my fantasy nfl draft to do with our the theres an always cheating fantasy nfl league that our friend of the pod dave started and so i had to do i did a crash course 48 hours of drafting and then as i was telling you only need to draft a guy whos out for the first eight weeks of the season early on so that was like arsenals trans policy exactly i brought in kim cstom followed by who was the newest guy they brought was it marino or whoever marino i have a question for you so were podcasting during the la rams lions game matthew stafford plays for the rams one super bowl with him former lions quarterback yep will matt stafford refuse to celebrate a touchdown if he scores one at line stadium how does that work in the nfl i think no its not like that its a good question but no hell hell celebrate maybe like the first time they played there but its been a couple years now i think i think hes i think theyre theyre over it like the lions beat them in the playoffs last year hes free to dunk the football over the goal poost if he so chooses absolutely i think everyone should be allowed to celebrate this idea that you cant celebrate with your i think it was i think it was like the football ramble they used to have a thing who was the there was a player who i cant think of his name is an irish forward but he played for like a ton of different clubs and that was like the joke is that he couldnt celebrate he couldnt celebrate any of his goals because every club is a place hed been at before so all right so thats your news and notes section brandon lets do a quick look at my wild card here and ill ill read off the team so if youre if youre watching on youre watching on youtube you can you can do a quick look at our the shared screen but if youre listening to pod which is still the vast majority of people we still well talk through all of my picks here but so the question for me is what do i wanted okay two questions that there that are interrelated right and they are what do i want to do in terms of having like expensive midfielders right like how like do i want to have one two probably not three right probably impossible do i want to have holland and solid right and so until you resolve that question you almost cant put a team together right and so i had a team that i put together for last weeks pot i had cole palmer in it i talked myself out of palmer again because i want a little more balance in the squad hes just a little tricky at 106 below and behold here i am again i brought in another expensive player and i have bayo saka who was who was replaced cole palmer he is 05m cheaper so there is a certain benefit there but ill just im going to read through my im going to start with the midfield first sometimes people do these the these discussions brandon you usually work back to front but the problem is you the meat of the sandwich you exactly you frontload it with the worst part its like if you were its like if you were talking about an amazing sand like you said amazing sandwich and you started talking about the bread as the bread is the best part of the sure but no ones like so this was the this was the style of toothpick that they used to hold the sandwich together nobody cares what was the sandwich okay so i go through the midfield i have i have a couple of questions after youre after youre done there so right now ive got saka seo e salah rogers as my as my midfield five then up front ive got holland pedro and wood right so whos missing from this whos missing is a liverpool player a better forward up front right an esac type player i could turn saka into into joda and use that money to turn wood into eso that would that would thats one option i could probably find the money to turn saka into palmer although again 101 to 106 doesnt seem like that much its quite a lot right it becomes very hard to you go from having four or five like having four defenders that you can rotate to having three right its like you end up having to move into a cheaper defender i did turn lets see me smith row has turned into morgan rogers another way for me to save 05m trent has joined my team brandon as well trent however i had trent and i had cba a while back and i thought geez like that feels like a lot of money for my defense like that just it feels like a bit much especially with a couple of poor fixtures ahead for for arsenal right youre not a wealthy guy either so not a wealthy guy well especially after all these some of these team value mistakes ive made the last couple weeks i think ultim i cost myself maybe like 02 so a bit dumb but but salvageable and i probably i have probably gotten a couple of price rises for my transfers as well so its the question is do i feel like i need to have two like incredibly expensive defenders and i feel like maybe i can get away with it for now the key player here the way i see it josh is baka and you indicated that you now you you got quadruple premium if you include trent in that camp a triple premium attack between salah holland and saka some people might wonder is this the time to go without saka with a plan to get him back in gw six perhaps when there is a big fixture swing for a handful of teams saka has spurs away followed by city away spurs frankly i think is a is a is a good enough match for saka i think thats its thats the inverse of city arsenal where you expect to be nil spurs arsenal you expect it to be like 33 or thereabouts so talk to me about your s saka later i think thats the question is i want to have saka for that 6 through eight swing and do i want to put myself in a position where i have to theres not going to be a way for me to do it with one transfer right so im im almost immediately locking myself into a two transfer move to bring him back in now i dont necessarily mind that right and maybe it does make sense to go isach joda right and then turn eso into well thats a good question let me pull up the the fixture like a list of fixtures while were talking here brandon because right who would be the under the radar strikers that might just be like punt worthy for the short term is that what youre thinking so like you could go well if ali watkins pres i just think watkins is a little tricky now with their first european its not its not the hardest match right this champions league match but still it gives me a little bit of pause like another early sub coming in its like a dream run for oly to go from finish in the top four last season with villa to go to the euros scored a career defining goal to now youre in the champions league hes not going to want to miss that opportunity so he can play 90 against everton and wolves on the other hand these are the two current ly the two best home fixtures back to back for villa everton wolves the in the calendar it switch away in six as well right so its its a nice its a nice trio of fixtures lets see newcastle have wolves away ful away man city at home so two pretty good fixtures better than better than arsenals fixtures over the next two right and then they do have man city at home so its easy its there are times when you almost want to lock yourself in to transfers right like you its like you almost want to force yourself to like its almost ideal to have a match like man city at home in game week six right like theres no i dont want to have eso for that its like autopay bill online its like this money is coming out of my account on this date and i dont have to touch it because i am a believer that the like fixtures are key right like its its like even the best players will struggle in difficult fix maybe like maybe like the absolute top peak right like maybe when like with the holland solot types theres a there maybe there like you there are some players who are so exceptional that like it doesnt matter what the fixtures are but those can be counted on one hand right like and i but i think in general even the best players are going to do amazing like fairly consistently round it out over the course of a year theyre going to do amazing in good fixtures and theyre going to struggle at least comparatively in tough fixtures right and so the question is he is saka one of those players whos fixture proof right in terms of just hes going to be able to deliver no matter who hes playing and and i think thats thats the question for me thats the question i have to answer right and so so and if i went joda so they have forest and bournemouth at home i think again its like its such a work in progress for me right now what i want to do with my squad because when we potted last week i think i like the version of my squad i had when we did the last pod more than i like this version okay well i i just i feel like maybe i think that calmer that cole palmer is a little bit more fixture proof im a little spooked by the flag right and i just want to make sure theres nothing there and so i dont necessar want to have my bus team i had a more balanced squad that i was tinkering with earlier today too and that was a squad but i just think like theres it worries me to put together a squad especially a wild card squad that doesnt have like elite highend talent right its like it just feels like youre you want those players long term right and so you dont necessarily want to like get yourself in a mode where and everybody wants to do this on a wild card right you do a wild card and you want to look at game week four and and be like okay whatever game week is has ahead of you up welka right you want to be like this is an awesome team this team cant lose even though we all know that like the first week after wild card like inevitably is a bust right but like you want you want that team that just like bang like right out of right out of the gate get the top score of the weekend exactly and i think the question for me was which i think opens up and i think its fair for someone listening to ask well why did you wild card at all josh and i think the question for me is i wanted mo and and i wanted more liverpool assets and there was no way for me to get mo solid without burning points and once i realized that i by doing that i was going to start rearranging my team i just thought im fine just doing this now right im fine just making a bunch of changes right now and sol just seems like such the obvious move for everybody who doesnt have him so its to use the wild card chip instead of spending four points seems logical enough given the the banking of five transfers if you can do its like restructuring our team should in theory we havent seen it in practice just yet cuz its too early should be easier than recent seasons so wild carding for the reasons that youre explaining doesnt seem bad or a poor strategy at all to me i im im tempted myself but i think well do it for content josh i will i will do what youll wait a week ill do the opposite okay i think just in one final note on the wild card because again i know we went into it quite a lot last week but there are a couple players that i think are easy picks for wild card one of the reasons if you dont have them its a laser wild card and i think kana and anthony robinson are both great wild card picks i think lewis dunk is an excellent wild card pick as well hes not my current squad because i cant quite afford him at the moment but i think that he is at 45 an excellent pick and they have some nice fixtures ahead as well i just think hes its in previous seasons you havent been able to get him at this discounted price right and i think a 45m center back whos going to start every match who has a little bit of goal threat is a useful fourth defender to have in your squad right and sano is my like its its like the for me pick like he still has he still has not changed in price i dont know why im the only one who is excited about this guy like i think hes like i think hes absolutely fantastic and and then ive got e in my squad right now as well who i think is a like its a hes a byy low pick right hes down to 69m hes done a lot of things well and just he scored last week and got and got was it three bonus right so hes hes hes hes off the hes off the mark already and hes been unlucky to not have more returns than that has been has been widely discussed i have a one followup question on this wild card because i think its very interesting this season where there have been some disappointing higher priced forwards namely watkins and eso is in that camp as well its either holland and pedro or and your and your boy chris wood of cannot forget about chris great so the reason i bring it up is most people wild carding now will be wild carding probably into a 352 formation and its interesting to me like to wild card all of the best players and somehow that just like funnels you to a 352 and do you have you thought at all about what the for what formation comes results from this wild card at the moment it would be a 352 353 rotation right like if i went with the wild card that you and i are discussing right now which i am like already like im leaking confidence in my wild card i felt much more confident last week when you and i were talking and now i think its i think its the saka thing i think you honestly this is why its useful there are times when i hate sharing my wild card team on our discord or or on twitter because i dont want i dont want to defend my picks especially because i theres a theres a style of like of like responding to someones team that i just find very grading which is always like itll be like youll share their team and then theyll be like no soand so question mark thats the whole comment right and its just i find it so grany for some reason and but i think theres you remind me of this new yorker cartoon that i love its a father whos putting his arm around his young son and hes giving him some playground life advice and he says son if you cant say anything nice say something clever but devastating right exactly theres always that type of comment its just like wow exactly what to say about my wild card team to make me doubt everything exactly and it can be a house of cards putting these squads together right you move one you like if i take sck out right that fre up 3m that im im its going be very hard for me not to reinvest everywhere and again and the reason that i want saka long term is because its just a tricky its very tricky to handle arsenal assets correctly i think right now because they have a tough gw four and gw five right north l derby and four man city away in gw five then they have a spectacular run from game weeks six to eight lets see if i can take a quick look at it here its lester at home southampton at home bournemouth away right amazing run but then in game weeks nine and 10 they have liverpool and newcastle away in gw 10 so tough fixtures and then you factor in a bunch of european champions league matches for them as well and it suddenly does not seem hugely appealing to have arsenal assets now once thats over once theyve gone through the gauntlet of tough fixtures theyre run from gw 11 out is amazing and i think that if you have not wild carded yet i think and youre going to try to get by with like one arsenal asset one or two i do think wild carding to get your ideal arsenal 3 between gameweeks 10 and 11 does make a lot of sense i think that would be one route thats thats thats out there so i think thats thats honestly where im leaning right now knockwood so nothing devastating happens to my squad but i want to probably move saka to salah for free once the game week four deadline passes and then try to try to work out through free transfers that fixture shift in game w six and the wild card around that time so thats thats the road im walking yep and i think that i think that makes a lot of sense so so thats thats my squad more to come well well talk more on the patreon po on thursday as we get more information about

brandon we just have matches on saturday this is a true a true classic in a way brandon because you have just you have eight matches on saturday followed by two on sunday just two matches on sunday is it is it is it beyond a classic now because there is a late kickoff on saturday super classic i like its of like class its like a rum and coke what weve got going on this weekend i like the late match by the way its its a fun one because in america this means you could do nothing all day but watch the watch the premier league right dont mind if i do dont mind if i do exactly in theory its with the with the 1230 start in england you could get up and do something with you take your kids to i dont know basketball practice and its like the nfl here on sundays right you can do you can do a bunch go to church brandon i know you love to get in a couple church sessions in the mornings if you can so just bang them out whenever possible reps in get your reps in but but now 730 10 am 1230 and whats whats what window am i going to skip maybe villa everton thats although even that has some pretty big f got back your boy morgan rogers ive got a sneaking suspicion hes going to make the cut going game what it is unfortunately its the its the southampton its the early match on saturday southampton hosting man united i think thats the one that i will sadly be nobodys going to have players in this match i know i know some will still have well i think like the statistically inclined may still have bruno right hes still doing quite well in the stat tables and stuff but and it is a great its a great match for in theory and he did score today i dont know maybe theres something there the content gods cannot help themselves with man utd i predict a 21 southampton victory here it does feel like it might be southamptons first win of the season im im inclined to agree it feels like the momentum to get ten out of there its all here like there united star players coming back from an international break whats going on do they even receive any coaching wisdom from t hog at this point i dont know i dont know either i dont know whats like i dont know what hes doing anymore i dont know why hes there i its like all the ownership stuff has to get resolved you the detroit pistons and went through this a few years ago when their owner died and there was like this big ownership takeover and it was like nothing happened for like five years because it was just like the everything was happening with the ownership just took precedence right and there so theres no real steward stewardship yes of things so but i think the big question we have a couple of questions about about the game week and i think the big one is from idleb and he says captain holland or salah they both have good fixtures do we go with the norwegian legion or the egyptian magician are these are those real nicknames i egyptian see real liverpool die hards would probably not relinquish the magician from coutinho who bore that mon for some time thats right but listen were not here to be pedantic we hate that stuff i know so if you want to call him the magician go with go with it go with it you didnt want to do another religious reference you wanted to say go with god i think okay the question is there a a like s almost sted up with my words there brandon is there a statistical like thing that you could like like are there statistical things that you would look at to make this decision or does it come down to feel right youve got man city hosting brenford you have liverpool hosting forest brenford and forest are both sorry just to finish the set up here brenford and forest are both quality midtable clubs well coached have a little bit of talent defenses are fine right like not great but not terrible again you could look at data points were 3 weeks into the season like whats im not sure that there are like hugely telling points of data at this point to tell you whether like one squad is whether one defense is considerably worse than the other right or whether its reliable enough information so so what do you think like just a i think its less statistical and more personnel based for me and that takes me more to holland because i think forest have been able to play im just thinking of the fullbacks honestly the wide play forest have been able to play with i think theres still betting in some new signings but i like their wide defense a bit more and it feels more stable and brenford it still makeshift with the injury to r henry and the entire backline and we just dont rate fleen super highly i it just the personnel that city are going up against defensively augers for a holland captaincy in my mind i in general im just im going to default to holland in any scenario because i just feel like he is i do think the man city are the best team in the premier league maybe arsenal will maybe arsenal will be someday but how about how about arsenal beat them in the premier league one year before we called him the best team right like i so they just dropped points at home to brighton like i dont know why like lets lets like theres no arsenal are in a better position as the underdog anyway right they dont need anyone calling them the best team at this point so i think the man city are the best team and they have designed i feel i say this every podcast but it is important to punch home all the time which is that the best team in the premier league has designed an attack to create chances for this giant of a man this this unusually tall usually fast unusually accurate forward right who has everything that you want and they have a pretty easy champions relatively easy champions league match at midweek as well theres just no reason in my opinion to and i the argument for salah if i were to make one would be certainly you can make one is that there is he its its more likely that hes going to get assist right so theres more like it could be that the absolute top highend return for mosala is somewhere in the 20s whereas maybe for holland its more like two or three goals right and so maybe its closer to like maybe his upper range is 13 to 17 points and hollands upper range is 12 to 23 i whatever like somewhere its like a little higher but i think that its so strange to me that is strange to the right word holland has scored seven goals through three ma three match weeks sal has scored three hes got three goals and three assists holland has to score hattricks to keep up with salahs just r of general xgi or not xgi but just gi his gi track is what im following im following them more closely than the flights brandon i want to make sure that hes doing well eeden well absolutely hes going to need an ostomy bag if he keeps producing at this rate we have a great we have a theres a couple of great yogurt companies here in the united states right and so ive been sending him fj and whats the other one theres another one thats up chani chobani hes getting a lot of lot of chobani too and and then im im from iceland im sending over the siggies as well so hes got a i dont think its guil cigarets and company i hope theres no connection theres a lot of people with very similar names in iceland right so so what is more sustainable the way salah is getting these goals and assists or holland getting hat tricks every match week now theyre both exactly as sustainable its like right and its not that holland has is getting hattricks he has scored in every match this premier league season so i would just think of it i would boil it down to more essential parts and that holland and salah are both returning every game week and it doesnt have to be a little more complex than that i think the point for salah is that he apparently has more routes to fantasy points because he does as you were saying have assists in his quiver and thats thats good so longterm its salah looks like he might be winning out by gw 38 over holland i do think that theres i think that there theyre going to be weeks when theres a better case for salah right i think game week five i think is an example of that right in game week five youre going to have man city and arsenal play each other and despite the slander that i just directed towards arsenal a minute ago i think thats going to be a extremely difficult match in game week five even with man city at home and that same week liverpool host bournemouth so that week its an easy decision right theres right i think its because i rate forest and brenford to a certain degree i would say that i rate h do i rate forest defense their defense is okay i dont know i do i rate either teams defense not i think that both teams and well i think the real question is i think both teams have enough attacking potential that they will maybe keep the other team like theyre not going to like i dont think either team is going to play seven defenders in the box or what or what theyre not going to like just absolutely park the bus and try i dont know brenford in particular have shown an ability to go to tricky away matches and get returns from them and so i think that i think that they could they could do something and even forest have like a little bit of theres some real talent in that forest squad too right so i think that they could they could give both teams could give the other one a run well thats it like whats the game state going to be through much of these fixtures is maybe another way to think about it game state city brenford is city are going to be in have like 100 possession again then and brenford will occasionally counterattack and i think liverpool forest honestly probably the same the same i think brenford have a good chance of scoring in that match i would give them a pretty good shot at that but all right so thats i think its i think its tricky i think weve made i think both of us are just realistically on holland and thats just how its going to be if you had salah would you consider it more strongly do you think or you i feel like youd still be on hollands even if you it would be tempting i think i would just because thats assuming im me and i have captained holland the last three game weeks and ive captained two hattricks i feel good about that if i had hadnt had if i had captain salah the last couple of game weeks im probably just like going with whats working for my team if that makes sense all right heres another question from crim trent crim i think brandon from the independent he says is it crazy to double up on jota and louise with a free transfer before transitioning to salah on a wild card this is one of those very specific team questions that i dont havet put in the podcast but i think it is i think it does get to something that i think is interesting which is is does aoda and louise double up equal one mosala or can it like can it do in a pinch right its not easy for everybody to get to most sol unfortunately right guess the problem with this tactic is always like weve seen with jot versus diaz is ones going to score and the other is going to blank so who are you giving up to have both of these guys so if youre giving up like one of these unreliable smith bruno types or whatever right its youre probably im fine with probably okay sure it sounds cool i think the general gist of liverpool is theyre playing incredibly well they have faith in this new manager everyones in so everyones a buy all right well what about what about your squad going into game week four what are you the plan right now is to hold your transfer can i can i see can i see what your squad i want to see with my own eyes what your kelly squad looks like im gonna throw it up on the youtube and ill talk everybody through what were looking at on the podcast here so there you go were at the homepage its great its great so ive got dean henderson and go finally palace have a defense a decent defensive fixture lester at home so looking forward to that vy hatrick he anthony robinson home west ham easy cba spurs away dont love it but ill start him anyway its its like do you start cba or pedro poro do you start both no im not starting both i a classic just go with the better team and i like spurs to score but i do think arsenal are the better team and well have the better of it so we just go with that logic and then cona at home with another great fixture with everton across the midfield anthony gordon away wolves i think anthony gordon finally scored in a away goal a couple of game weeks ago so now hes very playable i i was wondering if that was like if somebody was like if you were in a position where you were planning a wild card in gw five then i think youd be in a position where the question that we just had would have at least a like i think it would be a reasonable move right going gordon to like ds d in your case right i dont think that would be like that to me would be like plus ev like theres some expected value in that move for sure i think i like it potentially i think the way the non wild card for me and the low quantity of liverpool players im it works well for me if somehow forest are able to mute liverpool and newcastle have an explosive match because i think people are getting away from gordon and eso and if gordon and eso create points then great i have gotten to salah without by escaping damage there and thats what im hoping for my the big question i have with my squad is ive got jia pager esok and holland across the front i have benched morgan rogers who do i drop to bring morgan rogers in smith row if i look at my team smith row feels like the one least likely to has the lowest ceiling perhaps than all of these guys jaia pedro we have discussed his travel coming back from south america how many minutes can we expect from him then then theres morgan rogers who hasnt even produced any fantasy points so how does he get into this starting 11 just based on itest alone so right now ive got rogers on the bench as well as pedro roro and vace so i dont know what do you think of this bench makes sense its an interesting one cba versus poro as a as a debate i think i think i would i think i would start cba over poro as well right but porro clearly has the attacking assets that cba does not so you just go with the attacking defender but i i think i would no but i think i would still go asle because i think that arsenal have a better chance keep a clean sheet in that match and i think i do think that theres a pretty good chance that the spurs score but i dont see them scoring m goals right so then its like youve got to drop a scenario where they score one goal and that goal has a poor return attached to it right so and it feels very likely that arsenal are going to score a couple in this match right so its i so anyway i think youve got that one right i think i would probably start smith row over rogers as well and im with you even though i have i was debating smith and rogers on my own wild card and i went with rogers thats mostly because of the price right its a 045m savings there and i just think that theyre close enough and i and the hope is that he eventually starts returning but but we havent seen it yet and they have the the champions league is there any chance that rogers starts to get some rests ahead of some of these champions league matches i dont know right because i i dont think that emory is just going to not try in the premier league because hes so focused in the champions league i dont i dont think thats what anybody wants or expects right so so i think its pretty close i think and i also think when stuff like this is close enough its its like you should probably dont need to sweat it too much right because its just like its hard to say whos better between the two of them this is where i know i know youre not like you dont do this they have these sports books in canada brandon you can pull one up and see whos got the better to score assist prop right and those are all algorithmically driven right so its like take a look and see what u what vegas thinks or whatever right and and maybe thats how you make your sure im not im not above that at all for sure so its i think its a tricky week for benching and well well be accumulating press presser knowledge as we get closer to the weekend do we get anything from the managers on players comment back etc but this is where im at i dont know how i ended up with this vice captaincy on jiao pedro that was before his brazil call up you got to go joda there right all right well make a live vice captains pick here right on the pond and well save our team right there beautiful always set your bus team everybody you never know when the disaster could strike to quickly go back to the question about the double up if youre if youre wild carding next week i think that i would probably lean towards e if i had if i wanted a onewe punt on a on a on a player like if i was playing the wild card in five no matter what i think that it i think he scored the goal he got in for england which i think is probably a confidence booster for him and they play ler at home i think that its hes been taking so many shots it just feels like hes right for like a big match i just got double digit returns in game week three so its i like that my general preference is to diversify and not double up so im im with you on that one too all right well lets lets wrap things up here a little early this week but this is this is the second pod of the international break its were we need news brandon we need new news so lets say if you could only pick lets say youre busy this week brandon maybe youre traveling your kids have have some i dont know rugby practice this weekend brandon you gota you gotta you got to go to a rugger tournament all right its goingon to take up your whole weekend you can record one game and watch it saturday evening on your ipad in your hotel room whats the one match that youre going to watch this weekend whats the best whats the most fun match not the fpl match but the most fun i do think it could be fulham west ham i theres something about how this west ham team is taking shape where theyre just like a real wild card just like an unexpected team a weird team and fham have they feel like theyve had a good transfer window but i dont think they have coalesced and are as unified a team as we saw with fulham last season so i think this could be a real shootout at the cottage and i think that this fm team is fun its theyre theyre in transition right now and its interesting i think that theyre fun to watch too if i were to pick one match to watch this week it would probably be the liverpool forest match i think well of well we have the north lon derby on sunday i was looking at the saturday pict but thats like almost too easy right if youre watch the nor lon i think that north london dar is going to be great absolutely i think thatll be great too but just looking at the saturday fixtures again im i its like i went so far with my metaphor that i was envisioning the per like i had an image in my head of this 47yearold mother of three brandon whos listening to the podcast right now and this is this is her one chance to break away right and shes going to she got the bluetooth headphones pluged into the ipad kids are in the other bed raising a ruckus and shes going to get away for watching metro minute so but im curious i want to see what i want to see if liverpool can keep this thing going right i want to see if they its fascinating to me with the new manager and whether they can keep it up and whether salah can keep delivering and theyre just its its a its a fun version of the squad its more fun honestly than i was expecting the post clop era to be i thought thered be more of an adjustment now of course may not last but at the moment i think its fun and i do think this for team has shown some some spark too i dont grit even some grit and like i dont i just it seems like theyre i dont think theyre i dont even think theyre quite good enough to necessarily like challenge for a european conference league spot like that but i think that theyre the squad that have enough talent like i think morgan gibbs white in particular i think is good and been fun to watch and so they its like its not your classic good team versus bad team match think that forest could give them some trouble so of course sunday we have the northland derby i think those are i find those matches very hard to predict in general right i think a lot of results are on the table if i were to go with like a boring pick itd be something like 21 arsenal ill go 32 arsenal 32 arsenal somewhere in that range both teams scoring i could see either team winning but i think arsenal probably have a little more theyre a little more organized right now like a little more stable up front it feels like they are more likely to score two goals in the match so thats your thats your pod for this week well be back on thursday with our patreon pod well be talking through wild cards maybe brandon will have been
