yes guys welcome back to another fancy football fix youtube video my name is fpl nacho and in todays video we are looking at the top transfers going into game week five we have got a lot of injury concerns in the shape of oe watkins and alexander isach so were going to discuss those players and the best players that you should bring in if they are ruled out as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up as i mentioned the theme of the opening part is going to be all about forwards and i think that is the direction that a lot of managers are taking going into game week five we spoke about alexander esack situation now a lot of managers did move away from him in gw four so congratulations to anybody that did sell him because if you didnt see he was ended up coming off at halftime with an injury we dont know the extent of it right now and i always urge managers if you havent made a move right now please do hold off until we get some clarification on the fridays press conference but lets be real edh how historically is a bit of a pain for telling the truth so we might not get any full clarification regarding alexander esack but in the opportunity that we do we need to look at some options available and first up i want to take a look at some players that are priced around the same bracket of alexander isaks 84m we will be taking a look at some budget enabling forwards later on in this video so stick around for that so the three players that were taking a look at are going to be spurs dominic sanki arsenals ky havitz and aston villas olie watkins all offering brilliant opportunities to go to them in gw five and onwards so first up i want to quickly touch on olle watkins of course being the most expensive at 89m so you need a bit of money in the bank now there are a few concerns about olle watkins being pictured with an ice pack around his ankle in the champions league game against young boys now what weve seen right now it doesnt suggest that it is a new injury for watkins we all know that he has been playing with a slight knock playing 60 65 minutes pretty much every game and it sounds like that was just a precautionary substitution and he isnt necessarily a doubt for the weekend but again similar to the eack situation we need to monitor the press conferences to see whether he is available the problem with watkins right now is that everybody wants to own him look at his underlined numbers right now 373 expected goals of four games is ridiculous only second best to of course erling howland xa expected assist of 09 and 10 shots so the shot volumes there hes getting the big opportunities in this aston villa team and youve only had the big hall in game week four people who have owned him in the first four game weeks can count themselves unlucky cu he could have hold in any of the opening three games prior to that game in gw four and you can see here in terms of the expected fpl points 28 point 64 he is massively underperforming his underlying numbers and again when we take a look at the fixture for them in gw five at home against wolves followed by ipswitch man united and fulham it is a brilliant opportunity to invest in someone like an ole watkins whether youre wild card in game week six you can have the wolves at home game if youre looking to invest in him longterm youve got those brilliant longterm fixtures the problem of course with him is the slight knock that hes carrying i fully expect him to continue getting 60 to 70 minutes and the problem with john durant coming off the bench and delivering every time means whereas last season unai emry didnt have a choice he now has a brilliant alternative to ole watkins so he can turn watkins in to what was pr for a 90minut man now and rotation risk for fpl managers so we need to decide whether the rotation risk is worth it over the other options available because dominic sanki is a very difficult player to come to any conclusion to right now hes only played two premier league games of course the injury taken him out of game weeks two and three so the minutes here of what were looking at arent enough to come to any conclusion but he is the cheapest at 75m 044 in those two games that he has played and its worth noting one of those was up against arsenal where lets be real the best defense in the league by far with the likes of gabrielle and ca so were not coming to any conclusions right now on sanki based on his game week four before performance but what we can see is the performance of spurs as a team and they did struggle against arsenal in the final third now will that be the case once again in gw five at home against brenford i dont think necessarily now brenford put in a great performance against man city only keeping it to 21 the score line and that could be a difficult day at the office for all spurs but if youre look for a differential in the game again maybe a onewe punt or a longterm option sanki does definitely tick those boxes but we are buying right now a player that hasnt had any deliv points delivered and it is a little bit of a risk naturally going for a player like that finally kai havitz 194 expected goals 059 expected assists 10 shots brilliant underlying numbers and coming in 81m slightly cheaper than ole watkins now gw five just isnt the entry point for kai havers away against man city it just doesnt feel like the best time to be moving in alexander esac if we get no clarification on alexander isaks injury status id much rather just keep him for this game week than bring in kai havit however you absolutely do need to have kai havit on your radar from gw six onwards leester at home followed by southampton at home while double arsal defense probably is the logical move that feels like goals in those two games and while arsenal do score set pieces i feel like maybe trying to go for the double arsenal attack over that period probably has the highest upside so if youre in a position right now where isach ruled out you maybe have a munes as well in your team and other inj is maybe just go kai havocs in game week five while its not optimal gets you put in place for the longer term perspective but of course if your wild card in gw six then habits isnt an option at all so to conclude i think if watkins does look like he is available even if he does play 60 to 70 minutes those fixures coming up are fantastic so i still would probably have watkins as my number one pick but it all comes down to what we hear in the press conference otherwise if you want a onewe punt i do like dominic sank at home against brenford the move unless your team is in tatters and you just need to bring in a player who is going to give you guaranteed minutes that one can wait until game week six where i think hes a brilliant double up with the likes of bakar saka so let me know your thoughts in the comments isach wait until that press conference we hopefully we get some news so next up we need to talk about some budget forwards in the game because these two here are picking up a lot of traction in the community there are transfers coming in i cant believe its 2024 and were talking about jamie vardy still to this day but there definitely is some logic behind the transfers in for him and of course calv lean a player that i think we always like but his injury record speaks for itself and he is always a concern when you are bringing him in so first and foremost the two big caveats calvin les injury history yes it is a narrative and you might just keep telling yourself that and it never comes but historically he does get injured and jamie vardy lets be real isnt young anymore 35 37 i believe he is not going to play every single minute of every single game over these next four game weeks lets just be real this guy is going to play for leicester 100 but i cant see him being a 90minute man week in week out so if youre in a position right now where maybe you own a munz and youre looking to downgrade to a cheaper alternative because fulhams munes looks like he is now massively a rotation risk and i do think he will be benched in gw five dcl 59m vardy at 57m pretty similar price points and in terms of the expected goals calvin leen is leading the way at 132 compared to jamie ves 74 calv leen also leading his shots expected assists and general expected fpl points so all the underlying numbers do lean towards calvin leen and in terms of investing in a team for the fixtures coming up they play one another in gw five so its very difficult to determine which team you would like in that fixture with everton they got leicester followed by palace newcastle and ipswitch whereas jamie vardy has a difficult game week six but with the price of 57 you probably would be able to just stash him away for one game week and then play him in the bournemouth and southampton fixtures so i think just everton have the better fixtures because you could realistically start cal leing in all of those games but jamie vardy is a brilliant onewe punt especially if you are looking to wild card in gw six and i think thats a big thing right now managers need to understand exactly when their wild card period is you dont need to know the exact game week but you need to know whether you want to do it in gw six or not because if that is the case i do think jamie vardy at home against this evidence team who was struggling defensively could be a brilliant differential for your sides but if youre maybe looking a bit longer term and youre looking to have somebody for game weeks five to game weeks 8 i feel a bit more confident investing in someone like a calv leen yes he does have a history pass but for me i think until he does get injured we need to keep him in our minds as a good option at 59m so for me calin lein is a longterm option hes a great shortterm option but if you are guaranteeing yourself a wild card in gw six i do like the opportunity of having jamie vardy for one game we in isolation so let me know your pick of the two in the comment section be interested to know i think one of these two could be making it into my team this week so talking about cheap enablers we got to take a look at the midfielders in the game because some managers are trying to save some money in their teams to change the structure of it if they do not have a wild card available and its also worth noting if people are wild carding in gw five or gw six those players that we were excited about the morgan rogers is at 51 smith rose maybe youre getting a bit out of fashion right now so we need to know who the new kids on the block are going to be and pretty much its these three here evertons mcneel aston villas onana and bournemouths seeno its also worth noting taver has also been a brilliant pick at bournemouth but i want to pick out seeno in particular because he has been fantastic in the opening four game week so you can check out the numbers here seeno and onano with two goals a piece mcneil with one but in terms of chance creation mcneil has been fantastic at 214 compared to s menus 167 and onana has just been a wrecking ball in terms of set pieces isnt offering any much creativ in that aston villa team he is the destroyer boxto boox and a threat from set pieces we can also see the expected fpl points seeno leading the way naturally because hes so dominant in the expected goals column but in terms of actual fpl points it is mcneil thats leading the way at 22 onana at 21 and seeno at 20 so all three of these i do think are viable options in terms of onana i think theres a big discussion right now in the community about onana versus morgan rogers morgan rogers is the one that everybody went for but anana is everything we wanted from morgan rogers as a pick and when we do look at the underlying numbers in terms of the two onana is currently leading the way but from an it test perspective morgan rogers is always the one thats picking up the better spots in the team and controversially i still prefer morgan rogers in this aston villa team but onana end of the day is the one thats delivering points week in week out for aston villa but do i think its a sustainable underline numbers the answer is going to be no from a personal perspective but do let me know in the comments so if were looking to buy for gw five or game week six onwards we need to take a look at the fixtures because the end of the day fixtures are king we spoke about everton previously this is a good time to bit by everton i know team itself and in terms of the results been poor but in isolation i think calv leen and mcneil are considerations for your team we spoke about the fixtures as a great entry point this week if youre in a position where youre looking to move sideways or down from one of your midfielders in the game now in terms of aston villa again we spoke about ole watkins and his fixtures coming up the one thing i didnt note is the champions league return now theyve of course had their game against young boys the next game is going to take part between game week six and seven so that is going to be a consideration for fpl managers as well could that have an impact on the premier league minutes with some key players like watkins and onana we dont know the answer right now but again you are taking that risk if you are prioritizing an anana who has european football compared to the other two options that we are looking at here in terms of seeno this is a very difficult one because he isnt going to be a buy for you in gw five away against liverpool bourma have been great by the way and i do expect them to cause problems for that liverpool defense but would i be buying seenu this week the answer is going to be no but if you were wild card in a game week six or even looking at a transfer sano looks fantastic with southampton at home and leicester away and again with the combinations of your team you could just find a way of benching him if you wanted to when he plays arsenal at home and then look bring him back in the team later down the line so in terms of the options for gw five and isolation im going to roll out seenu that is a gw six pick i do prefer mcneil over anana just because i think his game time is absolutely locked in i think the fixtures are equally as good as aston villas and there is no european football that we need to contend with fatigue minutes extra for the players are inevitably going to have an impact later down the line so mcneil is my choice i cant believe im saying that out loud but i do think hes a good option for gw five onwards if you want to bring another everton into your teams so finally we need to take a look at the gw five predicted points and to be honest with you this is probably the most important one of the season so far because whereas in previous game weeks weve had some clear out and out picks and thats going to continue in the graphic that you can see here this is a big game we for those managers that dont own moala because whereas in previous weeks salah and harland both had fantastic fixtures and it was whichever one you have captain in because it makes complete sense this week a little bit more different now mosalah has a brilliant fixure at home against bournemouth i think its a tough game but bournemouth defensively are definitely there to be got at and moala rightly so if you own him should be your captain going into gw five especially based b on the predicted points at 73 but its for those managers including myself that dont own moala where the problems are going to a rise because man city of course at home against arsenal i back erin hen did any fixture but historically this fixture has been very close one nils a lot of nil nils and if there ever is a defense that is going to stop the run of earling howland it is going to be the combination of cba and gabrielle so we need to remember that this is a big week for captaincy if you do own moala so for those managers that are maybe taking the risk on oe watkinss fitness you could be rewarded with a captaincy on him 64 predicted points is solid and again do i think hell get as many minutes as howland no howland is definitely the minute pick but you do feel like watkins for 70 minutes probably has the same level as howand for the 90 against arsenal so if youre going for watkins and bringing him in i do like him as a pick in your fpl teams but again even though erling howland is playing against arsenal the numbers are still decent at 59 predicted points so if you are in a position where no other option looks great just stick it on erland howland all it takes is a penalty or the form that hes in right now would you be surprised if he delivered in that game i think the answer is going to be no so harland is still a good pick is he the best no there still are much better options out there outside of the top three we got palmer at 51m little bit concerned in the last game but i still think he is a great option if you do own him in a good differential e at five trent diaz jot allison making up the quartet of liverpool players finally son at 46m who sorry 46 predicted points who i think is quite a good differential this week against brenford it does feel like one of those fixures where son could deliver but again let me know in the comments section if you are captaining somebody in gw five other than mo sala let us know because ill be interested because it is a very difficult week for captain c so thats going to wrap up todays gw five top transfer video hope its provided some value and again let me know in the comments who is your transfer going into this week or are you maybe looking to roll the transfer with an eye on a wild card in game week 6 as always if you did enjoy the video make sure to drop a like
