good afternoon what is going on everyone welcome to your international break fpl burning questions my name is tom and today theres no fpl harry hes hes on holiday again but hell be back next week but i am joined by andy aka fpl sonaldo so andy how are you doing my friend all is well good to be back on bernie questions after i hi it is last week personally myself its been a eventful week in terms of price drops and price rises but other than that everything is good hows hows hows everything been tom yeah all good had a good show with johnny last week talking through my world card which well come on to in a sec but yeah first of all well yeah so what are we going to do today we are going to have a bit of a stock check of the best cheap players defenders looking into rico lewis a little bit midfielders looking into morgan rogers a little bit because his numbers are not actually that impressive considering everyone seems to want him and then forwards as well were going to have a chat about cheap forwards because rodrigo manise is struggling to get points but hes still putting up the numbers so well have a little chat about what to do there were going to chat premiums as well because i dont have harland caldo does have harland so well get into what we think about the big norwegian as well and then well have an early look at game week four because spoiler alert caldo has already made more than one free transfer so well get into that in time but yeah first of all caldo how was your game week three 78 points green arrow you obviously went on last week so do you want to tell us first what you did and your thought behind it yeah so i think i dont really know where to begin but maybe this will sometimes talking about our own teams isnt as helpful as talking about general content right but in my case i thought i learned a couple of interesting lessons first of all i did not know that in kungu and k quanza who are both in my team at the time last week would be dropping this fast and this much this quick i was expecting at maximum maybe 02 in terms of value lost in kungu but obviously hes gone down all the way to 62 i believe so thats a point4 loss and when i was looking at my team i was happy with my starting 11 decently happy with my starting 11 this is let this is the start of gw three so no the start of the end of gw two so one week before the start of game week three but i did know that i have a couple fires right i had en kunu kwanza and barco but because i knew that i was wild card in game six i thought that i could get away with the lean bench i had i known the price drop would be this aggressive i think i would have wild carded straight away and probably taken less value lost on top of that i had 0 five in my team from the start of the season and i really did not utilize that to my advantage and now its act almost useless that i save5 because i could have gone in kungu to umo for example before he lost his first price drop and that would have been a marvelous 14 point swing because i think he got 14 points this week right so but this also c intertwines with my life because i actually just had a very busy week in terms of work and i was traveling two flights on sunday tuesday so it was just a really hectic time for me to be focused on fpl so i put it on the back burner hence why i couldnt do the pod last week so i think a couple of lessons learned you have to be really on top of the price rises and price changes early on in the season i think theres a lot of luck in terms of making the right im going on here but making the right calls early in the season such as not having quanza because it was risky but thinking that the appeal of having him was greater than the risk that came with it and then guys in kungu i picked him some people didnt pick him and he did not do well so is losing price whereas these esrs are doing well so theyre rising in price so its a combination of a lot of different things but not every time youre going to have a good season so a lot of lessons learned in terms of price drops now the points wise its okay the points wise im just tugging along and its a long seasons to be had but certainly i am very concerned with the amount of value ive lost this season so far including the wild card im looking at in game week six and then definitely later down the line as we get to the double game weeks where the free hit comes into play im definitely going to struggle in terms of value im sure i can make up some as the season goes by but it is a start in terms of value start thats coming from behind to begin the season if what so theres my little speech there yeah now i think i think you need a bit more positivity you got isack came through e came through big time 10 points youve got robinson hes his is going up trends surely going to go up soon harlands 152 which i dont have him so its even harder to get to now yeah i think 2m after 3 weeks is perfectly respectable and its not a long way behind and also when we come to a transfers i think youre youre in a much better place now yeah i wouldnt panic too much about point 3 point4 you can make that up pretty easily well for example robinson youre going to get 0 one out of him soon so thats a start so yeah 2m 78 points i was just behind on 74 points i did wild card i ended up on this it was pretty similar to what i showed on stream with johnny last week except i think i had esack instead of jackson i was actually 11 off that draft and isack didnt fall or watkins didnt fall so i couldnt afford it and then my final decision was basically havitz versus jackson probably being biased i picked jackson because i was going to the game but i also think he could outscore havit in the next two games with the fixtures that havit has and yeah so for the podcast i went for fleen trent robinson gabrielle jotter palmer captain salah embo rogers watkins jackson and then on the bench i went for vlad marson xia pedro greaves and dunk so yeah what did you think of that when you saw it wild carded andy you pulled the trigger real quick right was it was it at the start of the game week i thought at the time i was a little because i didnt know in hindsight but at the time i was little confused as to why you did it because i thought you had a pretty decent start to the season but youve obviously saved a lot of value here and youve got the right pieces in play and i think youre set to save transfers so that you can catch up to the game with six wild c carters unless barring injuries and stuff that so it looks youre going to have to add to saka plus maybe hs as well as consider holland or other man city players by the time game six comes around but you have everyone in place ambo rogers j pedro so looks good looks good yeah yeah the decision was to get salah to get trent to get ahead on embro mo because i thought that southampton at home fixture is really good and villa as well a little bit disappointed with villa just an assist for watkins and off on 60 again which is a concern but hes pulled out the england squad it seems hes just going to get fit and i think jan is playing for colombia next midweek so theres theres no chance that watkins doesnt start obviously as long as hes fair yeah im sure were going to talk about watkins my only concern with watkins is that yes i understand hes coming back from injury or hes building up his fitness but duran is a super sub right so even if watkins is fully fit is he still coming off with 20 almost out of time or are they playing two top with duran as well so thats my only thing duran looks excellent off the bench yeah he does but the flip side of that watkins he had two big chances against arsenal he had two big chances against leicester its is coming for sure and everton at home you couldnt ask for a better fixture at the minute owner versus nonowner debate you must be scared that everton at home that could be no im gonna be honest im not that scared of watkins right now seriously halls come in for sure for watkins okay well yeah well have to see but yeah so we will move into a little bit of a stock check now were going to bring up some cheap defenders first of all fans footb scout members area table caldo ive given you the table but just for the podcast weve got cheap defenders their maximum price is 46 and theyre sorted by expected goal involv so top weve got sara apologies if i butchered that of the southampton fullback who scored at the weekend followed by lewis 8 nory martinez of man united leaf davis max kilman val fas lewis dunk lcer deine olaa and bottom of this list even though hes got two assists and his a bit of a favorite is anthony robertson robinson so well start well start with rico lewis caldo because you spoiler you have you have already bought him this week so you obviously what you see and i think hes been really unlucky not to get more attacking returns yeah i think i am in a little bit of a special situation where bringing him in made sense to me because i had a little bit of budget to work with as in three to spare after getting rico lewis so basically my tier of players that i could have got this is for quanza by the way is around that 45m mark right so on this list the ones that really stand out to me and are probably talked about the most are ric ls leaf davies robinson which i assume most of us already have and then maybe you could go for a dunk or a kanza if youre really playing for the clean sheets right i think clean sheets are still quite hard to come by and what by my case is a little bit special is because i know for sure that im going to be wild carding and gam six so im just looking at the highest upside that i can chase for the next two game weeks i do not need rico lewis to start in gw five against arsenal im happy to have him for gw four im betting that he starts in gw four and i see high upside at home against brenford so very exciting pick for me i thought at the beginning of the season as well before fpl began i was rating him very highly as well just very hesitant to bring him in hence why i dont know why but i pick kano over him so i think rico lewis is an excellent option i think his role is going to be very important this season the question mark comes if hes a longterm buy then im a little hesitant because champions league is rolling around man city has a lot of players walker is still yet to play most likely we could see walker come in for rico lewis in gw five against arsenal if thats what pep prefers there might be scenario where you see rico lewis and walker play but right now even rodri has not come back so rery is playing where rico lewis is playing right now in that midfield role even though he starts on the right back so theres a lot of question marks as to whether hes a good longterm play longterm hold and im a little hesitant there in terms of bringing him in now for the long term yeah hes been unlucky he scored in gw one that was disallowed he hit the bar in gw two and i think he had another big chance in gw three as well so he is definitely that goal is coming and it could well be gw four the only thing i would say is that obviously hes playing for england and kyle walkers not so is you could say kyle walkers rested or you could say he doesnt have any rhythm you could pick you could pick your narrative but yeah maybe walker plays the champions league games to start with yeah but yeah its its a shortterm pick i think and then i wanted to highlight eight nor because his data is very impressive i saw a heat map the other day and he is playing seriously forward far forward but the fixtures arent really there so hes probably one to note down on the way through there and then leaf davis got off the mark assists wise and hes got good fixtures as well obviously 18 assists last year do you think he is potentially a more longer term play for someone who wants that upside defender yeah i would say first of all on a nori as an owner last season when he was playing that literally he was playing left wing i believe or it was rightwing yeah and he got so unlucky with an injury when he was in form so i rate eight nory really highly and he is a very good fpl option when the time comes right now its just not the time with the fixtures and wolves are not performing at all i think their coach might even i wont say this but theyre theyre not performing at all so id wait on iy i would keep my eyes on wolves because i do know their fixtures turn eventually yeah in terms of were talking about leaf davis right yeah hes got those longer term fixtures and hes off the mark assists wise yeah certainly i think hes not a terrible option but i think the community is hyping him up a little bit too much because if such are i believe in the first three gamings again team data is not relevant right now because its only been three game weeks theyre at the bottom of the table in terms of xgc right so youre youre liverpool though to be fair youre youre but you also know how they play right they press they came from the championship and they refused to sit back they are still playing the way they do and press high up so theyre playing attacking football they did in the championship so i think with leaf davis youre youre not going to be getting many clean sheet returns youre getting a very low amount of clean sheets and so hes a longterm play that youre going to have to play him quite a bit in order to get that percentage of returns in terms of clean sheets so i think its just a pure attack attacking asset play for cheap which is perfectly fine right hes still a key asset key one of the key players for ipswitch absurd amount of assists last season right and in the last game i was watching he was getting into the rhythm and ips played really well in the second half so you just what youre getting for him so the question isnt whether leaf davis is a good option or not its what combination are you sacrificing to get him and maybe its not sacrificing youre actually upgrading elsewhere in order because hes such a cheap price point so i would think of it that way instead of thinking whether hes a great option or not he youre get youre getting what youre getting and what youre getting is the point im trying to make yeah and then just the final name to cover off robinson he two assists so far created two big chances but just an xgi of 018 so it feels he may be on borrow time slightly and were getting a little bit lucky at the minute but hes got west ham and newcastle the next few so people wont be selling do you think he youve obviously youve kept him havent you but do you think hes do you think were getting a little bit little bit fortunate with him sorry this is robinson right so i caught off a bit yeah yeah i think robinson also we dont have own him for the clean sheets we own him for the attacking returns but i think were getting a little bit lucky with his points and returns even though he looks threatening fulam are still i think top five top bottom five in terms of xgc so far so theyre not the best defense either and their fixtures are about to turn once game with six ends so yeah it maybe take the value and run soon but yeah so if we were ranking these i think ill sum up and then you can come in and maybe disagree a little bit but i would say shortterm rico lewis is top and then lewis dunc is second because i think forest and ips witch at home two good clean sheet chances and maybe a goal as well and then if youre looking longer term i think leaf davis could well be the one or robinson for the next few as well so how would you sum it up yeah but theres also another interesting option because longterm brenford fixtures are really good so whos whos the brenford defender that everyones hyping up well rico henry is coming back soon and theyve got vanderberg at 4m if he gets in the team theyve spent 30m good on him so you would think hes going to play at some point and hes 40 yeah so that might be a good play we know that brenford next from game week six next 10 12 fixtures are really good so and they rotate really well with brighton so maybe theres a dunk plus v whoever you just mentioned v play there as well yeah rico henry coming back as well hes about to come back from injury so that could be a play as well but yeah so would you recommend lewis just to finish would you say to me whos already played my wild card rico lewis is a step too far yeah i would honestly say so because you now have to youre in good position to make some good strides in the next two game weeks but now you have to start thinking about really the longterm stuff and you already have so many book transfers coming up soon in terms of the premiums and shifting around arsenal man city assets that you dont want to be what i did with k quanza and anduku you got to have some safety picks for the long run yeah i agree i agree but yeah i dont think its a its a bad punt but obviously if you can wait until england have played because i think r may be starting left back for england at least once in this break but yeah so cool so thats wraps up defenders well move on to midfielders we got a similar table now going up to that 7m bracket sorted by expecting goal involvement ill just run through these quickly a surprise name at the top seeno followed by embo matoma garnacho gibbs white e mina a dharma trial rate just 5m now looking quite good madw harvey barnes who i think is interesting if he keeps playing on the left with gordon shifted to the right and then sinister rogers and baritan diaz i want to start with morgan rogers andy because he yeah is very much sort the darling pick at the minute and not theres good reason for it hes got good fixtures and he looks good but hes hes towards the bottom here theres loads and loads of midfielders whove posted a higher xgi than him so do you think were getting sucked in a little bit maybe by the price or a couple of good ey test performances without really looking at the numbers no i dont think so i think the numbers are a little bit shouldnt be taken into account as the priority number one in terms of assessing players at this point in time i what i see from rogers i think gw one i was shocked at wow who is this guy thats physically a beast able to carry the ball forward run into box and be an attacking threat in positions at times and game week two i think everybody else saw it too right and thats why the hype was building up and this past game if you if you remember the second half he was at times basically the highest up the pitch in terms of aston villa a four type of role so i dont think were hyping him up too much i think hes 50 so for 50 and aston villa with their fixtures its a great bet whether it turns out that he doesnt deliver points we just have to h lower our expectations a little bit but i think hes solid plus hes getting i minutes i believe all three games so i him still as a as a pick and i wouldnt fault anybody for going for him now even its not too late to jump on the boat yeah definitely yeah hes created two big chances obviously one of those was that watkins open goal so he should really have a return or two which may make us talk about him a little bit differently jumping up to the top of this list embo number two there man city this week hes is he wait for spurs in game week five perhaps yes i think so i think if you thats why i just keep kicking myself because i had that 05 to go andu to embo 14o swing plus the value loss would be gone so its very unfortunate i missed the boat but he will come in game week six with everybody else most likely so then the issue then becomes who do you couple and buo with because maybe his points become ir relevant right since everybody all engage matters will most lik likely have him but i think for the next two game weeks you bet against him and its his fixtures are tough so yeah well get on to visa in the forwards chat a little bit later but he looks good as well brighton weve got matoma on this list who is posting better numbers than mina but is obviously 11m more expensive theyve got two good fixtures coming out forest and ip switch so theyre very much on radar i guess obviously money is an option but i guess if money wasnt an option its matom every day of the week isnt it yeah but theres also the this factor too he keeps coming off hes he doesnt get the 90 minutes and so thats a little bit annoying for his price point because at the same price point you could get e maybe is a little bit more expensive but its just thats why its hard to compete with e at that price tier of players and if its between e and moma youre taking e all day every day right so yeah is a brighton mina as well 5 and a half these next two fixtures i wouldnt begrudge anyone going in double triple brighton if thats if theyve got transfers and thats what they really want but yeah if you have money i think matoma is the pick there because his data shows that hes that a little bit more involved yeah and i do think hes explosive maybe not the two goals a game type of explosiveness but he goes on runs where its four attacking turns in five games type of thing so im sure at some point in the season maybe momo becomes a much more viable option but right now i just dont him when he competes against e at that price point is the point im making yeah cool a couple of names to mention as well harvey barnes i think is really one for the
