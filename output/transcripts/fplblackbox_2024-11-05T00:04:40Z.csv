what to go game week 10 then and another blank for harand thats just one return in five absolutely incredible two undefeat for city at bouth harland had five shots two big chances frustrating again just snatching at the m and its just not running for him it will change but then how long do we hold him the tactic is in many circles now get rid of harland for game week 12 move to palmer start bringing in arsenal assets again and its hard to build a case not to do that its brighton next for holland i think that is a good fixure for him and i think we hold for that if you still have him and then look at game gw 12 as we say spurs at home l is a good fixture so i think theres much to debate when we get there but as for this game week frustrated again as i said it was the five shots 090 xg in the game so a strong output in terms of data foden came out even better four shots and one chance created 104 was the most in the game week so far after saturdays games but he again frustrated i got rid and i dont regret that particularly with de brne back on the bench now for city that would indicate to me that peps going to try and get de brne back in that team for obvious reasons to get things ticking again and what does that mean for fodm with savio around with dku around savio surprisingly fit and back on the bench in this game after being carried off in midweek so foden for me although he stood out here is a concern going forward now that the bo is fit elsewhere for city vel got his third goal the season which is ridiculous output for a defender so far he started lewis didnt now as a lewis owner that is a little bit of a concern particularly after what pep said of the week about him he couldnt rest him hes the one player who couldnt rest him what does he do benches in for bournemouth so predictable pep does like having fun with us doesnt he im not worried as a lewis owner hes a player that i dont rely on as my defensive free but i want to bring in with fixture and i think he will get back in the team after that rest as for vardal two clean sheets for city although the goal output is impressive i dont i dont want to spend that amount on a player in a defense who still concede goals so for me v is a noo unless were going to change our tactics and start spending big in defense and thats not the way its going its all going into midfield which is why were looking to get rid of harland as for bouth they have the one of the key players when it comes to saving money and that is seeno 56 he was impressive again here seven shots involvements i think it was four shots three chances created in the game what was it 071 he exra ey from the from this game week right up there i think will be by the end of the game week if you got rid then i think youre going to want him back because on the ticker balou for second only to woles over the next 11 12 game weeks so the fixtures are good for seeno and bouth and he is clearly to stand out despite evan nelson get his third goal the season and kir has two assists for bournemouth its seeno the key asset but arsenal also slipped up of course one nil defeat at newcastle and this was a disappointing performance by arsenal 105 the xg created in the game and sacka came out of it with just two shots and one chance created 045 xgi havs just one shot its not enough is it and were starting to see them stutter with the injuries and dense in confidence gabrielle did come back into the team to help their defense but its now just what is it five of out a clean sheet now for arsenal theyve moved down to the fourth ranked defense in the league theyre the seventh ranked attack in the league when looking at xg data so suddenly theyre just theyre not registering their elite numbers and assets like sackur and havs arent the gotos that they were before the fixtures have been tougher for them and certainly from gw 13 onwards thats when were starting to get interested in arsenal once again and i think i will be moving to at least one of sacka or have averts but im probably not going to load up on that arsal defense until i see a bit more solidity i think its at fullback they got the problem lot of rotation lot of injuries there lot of unsettled situations in that defense which has meant that ryer and celba and gabrielle dropped off in terms of output as for newcastle as isak and gold new combin for the goal no surprise theyre their two key players but 053 xgi or xg in the game for new car suggest that they havent found the fluidity yet they go to forest they go to city ground next and thats not going to be an easy game for newcastle so i dont think that were in any hurry to look at newcastle but they could yet be some used to us over the season thats for sure liverpool do what liverpool been doing all season grinding out the result one n down to a brighton side that lo they had looked like they had the better of them in that first half which they did but slot did the magic again at hal time didnt tweet tactically but just got more out of his team and they turned it round to win the game 21 salah of course with the crucial winner a lot of lot of managers moved off holland to captain salah and it worked out i captain salah and it worked out and he came out the game with five shot involvements it was two chances created three shots for not for 65 xgi the big news here though was the team news from slot he rested diaz to the bench again started gakpo rested robertson who looks now like he might have lost his place at left back to simas and simas came out with three chances created one shot as well 056 xg which significantly surpassed tren alexander arnold who only created two chances for 010 so if simas has got that left back spot now at 46 thats an obvious downgrade if you want to move money off trent and its becoming harder and harder by the game week to justify holding on to trent liverpool defense is still top ranked its still one weve got to consider despite conceding here but they lost canate to an arm injury and it was interesting that gomez at 48 was the player to come off the bench not quant to replace him so there could be another budget option there and you got to ask with simas and gomez perhaps in that starting liverpool defense now are they going to be as secure theyve done okay with allison out and hell be back soon we would have fought after the international break so that might signal another increase in solidity at the back for liverpool with allison there although keller has been good so they were a defense and a team that we got to look at but its in attack where its all about and i think with j out injured and now diaz benched again it is boiling down to you got to have salah ar you and i think with the fixures that liverpool have got and the form that hes shown nine points here almost a seventh double digit return his consistency is extraordinary and as we move away from harland its just becoming obvious that salahs got to be a target asa brighton the one player that stood out for me and i mentioned in black box in the week cat ogo who play played right midfield rather than right fullback and got his goal two shots and one chance created 030 xgi with brightons fixtures perking up very soon as part of that swing from game week 12 i think cad ogo as a defender has got to be worth a look so i was at the city ground to witness the latest victory for three in a row now absolutely extraordinary three and0 over west ham it was very routine and chris wood an eight for the season he is an absolute machine just cant be stopped two shots 79 xg i in the game cleared one off the line as well declared man of the mat im not sure he was there was a lot of good players on show for forest but wood its hard as i said to make a case against him because forest are getting him the it was moreno who provided the assist in this game mareno had his best attacking game for forest but ana also came out with a goal the other fallback and then minkovich was so unfortunate he had one just wide one headed just wide another effort palmed over by fabianski with a great save its only a matter of time for milenovic gets that attack in return so much potential in this forest side havent even talked about hudson ado who came out with eight shot involvements four shots four chances created got the goal of course so theres just value in that forest team everywhere the thing is the fixtures do stiffen up its newcastle then it switch but then it does get tougher for forest but theyre a team that are just not going to be a pushover for anyone and i think theyre going to keep clean sheets when you dont expect them to as we saw at anfield so i cant back against going with one of the defense and chris wood at the moment although there are many options up top eight goals for the season and the service just keeps coming and the confidence that forest side is just on such a new level and it was so obvious that there was a golf in ability i think in what we saw in that game against west ham but a golf in also the confidence level the spirit in the team west ham looks shot absolutely shot id be very surprise if l can hold on to that job and if youve got boing i admire you for the differential but that west ham team just arent playing well theres no confidence no spirit there and i think theyre going to struggle while ly i just cant see him finding the solution so for me west ham remain and noo forest the opposite its switch one lester one pretty predictable outcome from this game and it was only a matter of time before leaf davis rewarded his owners as well if you didnt bench him like as have to enjoy that so leaf davis with the goal came out with three chances created and the one shot 031 xgi he is a great asset in a promoted side but its a promoted side that is going to concede goals not keep clean sheets and theyre not going to score too many either so its very similar to what we saw with d last season although i do think the leave davis is a step up its tough fixtures to come now though spurs united and then firs for it switch so if youre holding davis youre probably going to bench him over those games anyway as for leicester b a not to stand out i think hes outstanding another six shot involvements three chances created three shots and the fixtures do turn from game weeks 14 onwards for leicester and i think like he bit like leaf davis hes never going to be an asset that we can rely on and play every week but when fixtures are good i think hes a player we got to look at and that run for leester is tempting and he is absolutely outstanding for me so anom w everton neil a game of little consequence in fbl terms apart from more agony for calvi lein owners i shouldnt tease them but its now six successive blanks with a start he only played an hour here before ironically being replaced by betto who had who had evertons best chances and perhaps should have got them at least an equalizer and beta came on and topped the xgi in this game as well calv l only had one shot hes had i think 16 shots over the six last six starts without a goal and he would he would he hold his place they keep faith in him but i dont know i think if youre holding calv lein youre this long this was the fixure that you were going to hold him for but then youve got to get rid and i just think theres too many options now as for m neil he came back and i didnt expect him to and it is west ham and brenford next there are two defenses that are going to give up chances so if youre holding it now i think you can you can stay patient and less so i think with calv le given the confidence and given the profile for better which is rising all the time as for southampton not too much to talk about from a fancy perspective if you had harwood bellis and started him well done first clean sheet for southampton h and as for dibling owners they saw their player benched and so hes perhaps becoming a fringe player again and not that four five budget option that we hoped he would be entertaining draw at molu to all a lot of investment in this game in aint nori and kuna and i think its warranted we say that the fixture ticker is just overwhelmingly positive for oneals side and i think those two assets showed enough in this game to think that well get returns from them kuna came out with an assist but again he was hes their one key player strand lson got the goal set up by kuna but he also set up three other chances came out of it at 032 xgi but hes by far their key player and i think he will be profitable for fb managers over this run as for eight nori i think he had a couple of shots no chances created youre not going to get clean sheets in i dont think that will be a rarity so you are relying on attacking returns a bit like leaf davis but i do see think its warranted given his price 46 and given the fixtures that got but kuna for me is the big standout as for palace theyre a nogo in fancy terms particularly why a is out so not anything to talk about of note here maybe when a is back well start seeing some appeal but right now the interest is all about ws in this game and its justified so thats it for saturdays games not going badly for me this week cu i had the sal captaincy and also i started seeno and bench lewis nothing shady there before you say it i just thought the bournemouth would score and that would mean start seeno and bench lewis worked out for me sania with the goal and like i said a player im going to hold on to now ive got five players no six players left to go including four in the spurs villa game so ive got pao johnson rogers and salanki big game for salanki if he if he doesnt show up in this game and just a couple of shots would be nice wouldnt it then i think that hes going to be a big sell very soon ill probably hold him for the it switch game but after that hes going to be gone unless we say something spectacular here big game i think for villa as well watkins that i think he needs of a turn in this game to hold off to stve off that move towards the cheaper strikers like kuna who weve discussed and rogers hes one of several midfielders that may make weigh in teams ive talked about those who got rid of seeno ive got johnson seeno hbmo and rogers one of those has got to go because salahs not going to go when i move to palmer and right now i am thinking it could be rogers so how he performs and what he produces in this game could be key to whether that changes my mind well i asked for the spectacular from san and i got it a 16o return biggest of the season five shots all in the box 152 xgi the top in the game week so far with one game to go we got what we wanted from him i think the difference was that he was spending much more time in central areas further forward and they were getting crosses in thats the big thing it as it turned out johnsons goal johnson got a goal from his only shot in the game he took that off the toe of sank it could have easily been a hattick he had a half chance in the first half as well so much better from dominic salanki just when we needed it as well a massive return for my team more on that in a bit johnson also came in only had that one shot as i say not point6 for is xg from that effort but its seven goals in 11 games now for johnson no question that he is a threat and hes and hes getting more minutes there is just no one off the bench who can replace him he was absolutely shattered at the end but an isnt subbing him early anymore so thats a key thing hes on the pitch at the death unlike son who only had two chances created in the game very quiet overall created that goal got the assist for johnson but didnt have a major impact was very myth to go off on the hour mark was a bit of a surprise because it was one all at the time but in the end rardon came on and set up that goal got an assist himself so for sank second so overall a great attacking performance by spurs and theyre the only team now who are averaging over two xgi non penalty per 90 they are the top attacking side and they take that record into its which at home next who have an xgc non penalty p 215 so its the best attack versus the best defense when it comes to xg and xg conceded coming next and as a manager who holds porro johnson and salanki thats got to be encouraging do you do you hold slanky for that course you do and maybe after as well they go to man city and week 12 thatll be the crunch fixture because i wont know whether i need to get rid of johnson or salanki what i do with spurs but their fixures after that arent too bad and i think weve seen spurs go to the ead and cause them problems and were seeing a lot of teams this season cause city problems so im not against taking my spurs players into that and perhaps if you have to hold salanki for the trip to the yad if its off another return against it rich that might not be a bad thing as for villa in this game rogers gave me plenty of food for as well i talk about whether it was him i was going to get rid of he got the goal he couldnt miss it from the corner it was a bad mistake at the set piece again by spurs who struggle with those dont they but he did his piece he had four shots no four shot involvements two chances created two shots watkins in contrast was very quiet just two shots 046 three touches in the box just one goal in four now for watkins and thats a concern he got a price drop overnight so people are moving him out and i cant say i blame them because those cheaper options as i said are very tempting and its liverpool way next before the fixtures pick up with palace brenford of southampton the next three at villa park so maybe a hold but i can see why people needing to flush the cash out are getting rid of watkins one1 at old trafford and that last a goal war turn for bruno from the spot its been due hes had five shots in each of his last two games he had eight shot involvements in this game four chances created four shots the penalty was in the end the decisive action but the data has been pointing to this and pointing to a surgence in bruno could he become an elite asset again under amarim i dont know the fixtures are certainly theres no doubt lester its which everton the next three for united but i do look at their attack and think rashford gach show hland are these ruthless takers of chances that bruno is going to get assist from thats the thats the key issue united i think its nine goals all season only southampton i think have scored less so are we going to see that overnight resurgence of that united attack i think its a big ask but if you got to make up ground with those fixtures bruno could be an option the issue for me is just the midfield places ive spoken about what am i going to do to make room for palmer and finding a place for bruno as well i just dont see it and for me that its a little bit optimistic on the impact of the new manager as for chelsea palma had a fairly quiet game still sneaked in for one bonus points low six shot involvements on the day three shots three chances created 071 xgi i dont think he had his best game less impactful than i would want and it interesting as well he started out on the left hand side again rather than the right and i think hes coupled with reese james because when reese james switched in the second half and karella came on we saw palmer go with james as well back to the right hand side so i think theres something going on there with morasa tying up reese james with palmer because on the other side he inverts the fallback which uses up the spaces that palmer would be in on that flank so i think thats a thing to watch for i think its debatable yet whether thats impacting palmers output but theres no question for gw 12 with the fixtures chelsea has got hes got to be a target i dont i dont think im going to change my plan there hes coming in game week 12 and im going to have to sell harland to make way for that move else were for chelsea not too much to talk about other than jackson picking up his fourth yellow card the season he had one chance cre thats all a disappointing game for him and that fourth yellow makes him a risk now among other players we talked about seeno yesterday forgot to mention hes on four bookings as well along with eight nory so weve got to watch that now were getting close to those first suspensions and they should be factors in our thinking when it comes to transfers well that was a crazy game as a fleen owner it was absolutely heartbreaking i knew it would happen i absolutely knew it he was sitting on 12 points got 10 saves and i was i was chatting to as on whatsapp going and as me said to me when do you think hell break your heart and i said when he gets maximum bonus then he then hell the bed and he did exactly that in spectacular style brenford completely blowing it conceding two late goals fleen going from 12 points to four it would have been an amazing hall for a keeper that hasnt kept the clean sheet all season against a team who have scored in every game it was inevitable i knew it would happen and it did and so to be honest i dealt with it okay and to be honest i had a good game we more than that in a minute but from the game very low impact on fantasy wilson bas robinson got an assist he was probably the only asset to come out with points in the game that had impact on fbl himz went off after 70 minutes had two shots 009 xgi so low xgi in the game backtoback blanks for himz now dont think its a major concern and theyve got crystal palace and wolves next so the fixures are still good for him and his owners and although munees is there i think it will take another couple of blanks then you got to start to worry so there is concern particularly if he doesnt get a goal the next two elsewhere inuma is completely anonymous for brenford as an attacking force they were they were just not at the races at all they got the early goal and then they just sat on it and they got what they deserved in a way because they didnt show too much ambition but so very little in the game for fpl managers in the end i came out of it a four points of fle and ill take that and three for bumo ill definitely take that brenford got bournemouth everton and leicester next no clean sheets for fleen there but ill certainly take the four points its just a heartbreak in having had the 12 but 75 points for the game week for me which is which is crazy just what i needed up to 14m a rank gain of 19m which is exactly what i said on blackbox last week i said that although i was having a bad season for rank i always felt this season there were big point swings in it because of the way that the variety of teams and the variation in the heavy hitters and just by playing sano and captain in salah and johnson came in as well as did rogers i had this massive rank climb so im i feel much better about my rank now and ongoing continue to enjoy this season so lets see how it goes from here hope you had a good game week just a bit of injury that came in today canate is fit looks like hes going to be okay so no danger there if you own canate and no appeal for gomez if you were thinking of going that way elsewhere palmer apparently picked up a knee injury from that from that tackle by martinez im that didnt look serious to me but theres theres lots of stories going around about that and also harand picked up a training injury there was something on sky today which is pretty laughable i dont believe a word of that and theyve got the european game coming up so well get it on that well round all that up on blackbox well be back on thursday i think itll be so me and a will be talking then im ive closed the gap on him feel a lot better feel more optimistic hope you do too crazy game week lots more to come hope you like this hit the subscribe button if youre new and if
