welcome back for another video weve got a great experts video lined up this week i dont think weve ever had so many different chips active in one game week if youre new to this series every week we look at data from hundreds of top fpl managers many of the best fpl managers that have ever played the game including their transfer plans captaincy chip usage and the experts team hit subscribe to follow this throughout the season lets get into it a very quick manager highlight to kick things off them hcar finished on a very respectable 49 points in an otherwise lows scoring game league and he sits top of the expert league ranked 44k no ones even close to him at the moment so well move straight on well done ascar so lets break down what theyre up to of their transfers to gaming n this week just 28 the roll on the transfer 34 making one transfer 25 making two and 11 making three transfers theres one wild cut active this week as well which well take a look at later theres one free hit active this week as well more than that in a minute so a ton of transfer activity who are the most popular buyers and sells by the experts this week the most bought player is palmer 38 of picking him up before newcastle home which means the most sold player is sacka exactly 50 of sold before they face liverpool home on paper palmer home to newcastle isnt upgrade on sacka home to liverpool have got less expected goals conceded than any team fest goals coned the most clean sheet plus of course zaker is flagged now what we do know is he wasnt in the champions league squad midweek however that could have just been a case of saving him for the weekend as arsenal squad on paper is more than good enough to get a result against shakar which they did without him the there was a tweet from sam c reports which said hes expected to be available for the liverpool game having trained already pending any last minute changes or niggles so given sacka is not necessarily a bad play at all however 22 of bought sun most of those are sacka sellers as well big picture palmers an extremely longterm hold if youre buying this week this is his fixture run all the way till gamei 27 whereas sun makes a bit more sense as a 3we play for palis villa and then ip switch before hes got man city in gamei 12 where you can look to switch sacker or saler in 15 of sold havocs this week with the most popular replacements being himz 18 to bought him then ca 5 vissa 4 now jimenez has been incredible form recently hes returned in all of his last five games in the league with four goals one assist and theyve got a nice block of four victores ahead everton brenford palace and walls only 57 mil its an immense fixture for brenford this week as well home to ip switch sephora experts are moving early in vista he was back from injury last match coming off the bench and did very well in the early game mix in the season before getting injured perhaps not guaranteed of a start this week having only just returned but theres a good chance he does hes also got solid running games where he can leave him in for a good five or so game weeks 6 of bought foden who did score man citys 5 and0 win in the champions league of course he was benched last game we further to that though pep says that gish is out of action for 7 to 10 days with doku out for even longer so hes got to be nailed on for a start and its southampton home as well 5 of b vardal who could also benefit from those injuries perhaps with some license to get four down the left flank 133 of sol trent ahead of the arsenal game make no mistake hes still an incredible pick hes a top scoring defender the best defense so far this season hes got brighton home villa home and southampton away after arsenal however many experts have taken him down to a cheap defender to help fund palmer eight nor has been picked up by 18 now we could see wolves using a back three with eight nori playing advanced down the left wing and w still have the best longterm fixures of any team now and their bad run is behind them at least another one took consider his penz hes 4 and 1 half mil the center backs got two goals in two games hes got good clean sheet oz this week against ip switch lets move on to chip usage then and i cant remember this happening before in the series but maybe it has done weve got three different chips active in one week one wild card one free hit and 10 triple captain him so which one should we start with lets go for the wild card first fpl shs pulled the trigger heres his wild card team s and lumbley who his keepers in defense hes got gabriel burgess vardal mikeno and a nori in midfield hes got rogers bumo foden palmer and johnson and his front three is himz harland and kuna heres what he had to say i decided to wild card finally after cbas red card having no bench or three transfers im going with the triple city after peps comments last night about injuries etc foden feels like a norain now vardal stones le is still up for debate though palmers a log is one of the main reasons for the wild card getting the two woles players with an incredible run of fixtures as well and going with the quality in the pens of kuna instead of lon getting johnson is my spurs asset as i dont believe suns worth 3 mil more started the season with seller and although i didnt want to sell him im building a plan to get him back in two to three game weeks if i dont go with foden after all the money will go to watkins instead and ral becomes bon not instead of foden ral first sub in this draft to come in when rogers or ca have a tough fixture so what about the free hit then now ordinarily the free hits always been used in the blank or double gaming but this season we have seen chips used in single game maks much like the triple captain this week and due to only two expected game is much later in the season you cant make the case for using a chip in the single game if it makes sense for your team fb cre looking to use his free hit this week and his current draft is fakening goal pinck duncan lewis in defense bumo rogers fod and palmer in midfield wood harland and welbeck up top heres what you had to say the decision is pretty much that in my opinion the free hit has a slightly lesser value due to one less big double gaming this season and with wild card one not yet activated im planning to activate it in gamei 18 im hoping i can navigate the gamei follow without the free hit ive also got a slight harem fomo as hes not in my team i have salah instead who i have back in gamei 10 ive got no palmer foden either and double aral defense against liverpool i didnt activate it just yet though there are still a few players up in the air fod and welbeck etc but the free hit is pretty much triple city double brighton triple brenford and palmer and wood this team might need some slight changes with well becker d i could switch to 352 lastly the triple captain with 10 going for it this week bens one of those managers going for it his team is sanchez and goal hes got viio mikeno trent foden palmer seeno bumo vista harand and salanki its an insane team and on top of that his triple captain is activated heres what he had to say im using the triple captain ship in harem this week as i think he stands a very good chance of a huge hul usually id keep the triple captain for a double game me but seeing as we are expecting fewer of those this season im happy to use it now id rather prioritize my bench boosts and free hit for the double game mix we do get as i see them as generally being more effective than the triple captaincy southampton at home feels like the perfect fixture of a city southampton are a team that likes to try to play but unlikely to park the bus the coach is also under a lot of pressure and as a team they must be reeling after they surrendered a twoo lead at home to leicester last week and end up losing 32 the last place you want to go after a result like that as the yetti had all in all it looks like a great opportunity for harland im not put off by his three blanks and roow previously in the league hes been scoring in european games and hes bound to get plenty of chances against southamptons shaky defense im looking for him to score at least the braid for the chip to feel like its been a success that seems very achievable this week elsewhere on my team i had fre free transfers and im using them all to bring in vardal foden and visa viio starting to look like the fantastic fb asset he was towards the end of last season and hes a player that i plan to be my team long term foden is a shortterm pun he hasnt played many minutes yet this season but expect that to change now his fit and see his next four fixures look good from an attacking point of view vissa was just back from injury last game we and he came off the bench so hes a minute risk this week but given how important he is to the team i think hell start brenford have a great run of games for the next five and visa had three goals and an assist in the first four matches before his injury at 59 mil im anticipating hell be the best budget forward in the game over the next month or so and im going for him now to get the plum hiip switch fixture thanks for sending in j and good luck with the chips this week moving on to experts captaincy and well keep it short and sweet cuz 100 of the experts a captain in harland not one bit dissuaded by those three consecutive blanks its the first time that man citys fa to score in three games in a row everything points towards him being the best choice if you got him hes top of the goal scorer odds he got brace m week in the champions league before coming off a little early ahead of the southampton fixture and fp review has come comfortably top this week with 91 points palmer in second if youve got him and not harland and fodens close behind on 67 so hes a shout and iuma 64 and that brings us to the experts team for gami n9 if you do appreciate the time that goes into each of these videos hit subscribe and drop a like on the video there has been a change to the team its ryan goal its trent mikeno and lewis at the back its boomo palmer rogers and johnson the midfield harand cavaler and salanki up top weve got fansy gabrielle seanu and greaves on the bench so theres some bench depth here gabrielle versus trent is a pretty tight call this week it could be a low scoring game in honesty but celba suspension plus the possible calif fury and timber injuries might nud it trenway if youve got both let us know who youre starting so looking at the experts ownership percentages harlands the joint most owned in the game a 97 ownership among the expert so how is he 100 captained i noticed there was a bit of confusion in the comments last week so just to explain the small difference here every week we dont always hear from every single participant theres always some that cant understandably so there could be a couple of harland nonowners that havent responded this week the ownership percentages are from last weeks ownership as well cuz its impossible to project the ownership percentages accurately for the next game me so its always possible that one or two of buying this week as well not represented certainly creed he on his free here however the experts team does factor in the track of was made and this week sackers dropped out the team in favor of palmer given the 50 sold sacka and 38 bought palmer on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gami 9 heres what they to say this week royal blue fpl has sold havit and johnson for strand lson and foden and he says i know many have jumped on him already but fodens ownership is still only 66 as of wednesday night im expecting that to sky rocket in the coming weeks initiated by a hall against southampton i hope guido patista says im looking to get palmer and a 45 mil defender this week 8 nori pinck on minkovich for sacker and tren ill then use that money to get salon next week from diaz by also downgrading cavat l into a 45 mil forward that will give me a salad palmer and harand team which im happy with moving forward flair player says now the planning kicks in you need to decide what premiums you want and when you want them they could be big swings so you cant be emotional with your transfers fb spaceman says im beginning to think that michel artetta has not been entirely honest in his press conferences and last jason flemon says just remember folks as brutal as the opening eight gamix have been theres still 30 more gamic left for it to get a whole lot worse thanks for watching and if you appreciate the time that goes into these videos hit subscribe and drop the video like see you soon for the next one
