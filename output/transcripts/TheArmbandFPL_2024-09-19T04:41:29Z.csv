sh hello everyone and welcome to the fpl armband im chris kierans here too hello good right how are you good how it doing not too bad today going to preview game week 5 its a bit of shorter show than usual but were going to do our best to fill him had a busy week this week so thanks for tuning in so well talk about the awful n of game week four and then have a little pivot and talk about game week five it was so bad wasnt it this past game i didnt do as bad as other non hard harland lless teams but ive had a all red arrows so far this season so thats thats been my word is it ive not had a single green yet so cool i had i think i had two game week two and three were green and then i just sunk back down to like 32m now its its savage i dont even know how youre below me hows that happened im only two million rank and ive not owned ireland i know i know i had a nightmare this weekend with the with the transfers lets lets get on to of course you did to that ill just go through mine quickly first so i was so sure that i trent was going to come in for cba at the start of the game we i was thinking thats a theres a guarantee like uptick on that because cling sheet looked pretty nailed on there was loads of attacking potential there that didnt i didnt think that was going to backfire so that backfired and then i was contemplating for age to do sackur and bruno out and on saturday morning i did it for salah and minty and my gosh point swing was horrendous i think i worked out if i just sat on my team and not done any moves cba sacka and bruno would have got like 17 points and i took a hit to do it so i gained i gained one point so i was like 18 points down it was just it was just savage but a lot of people wouldnt say position because they got rid of sacka but its just not it was a bad outcome how do you feel about it going into the next few weeks happy well i ear marked game week six pretty sure im still going to wild card them because theres so many like little problems in my team well to kona is a problem moon is a problem i dont like the balance of having s and harand still hendersons been pretty crap i might get an arsenal defender back again so theres a and brenford so theres a few things id definitely like to change for game week six the team looks okay for this game week as if esas fit but well talk more about that in a minute lets at your team you got just bailed out by harand didnt you did you even start smith murray this week i did i started smith smith ran harlem were the only ones that did return for me this game week so it was poor and then to b off three people did return was not good right i put i put your your merry soldiers up there as well so 45 one point below you so i did hall to dunk and see all starting was annoying but they conceded didnt they i cant remember what happened in that game they did they two1 okay so dunk came in six points it was a free transfer so no points loss for hits or anything so that was nice and then watkins coming in clutch with 13 points which is great he is fairly low owned by the twitter bubble and people seem to just be put off by his minutes which i get and then smith row coming off the bench for j pedro i didnt see that bunching benching coming like no nobody knew about this random knock at all like so he just came back from his thing and from his internationals just he played like 45 minutes and not in the squad at all just so i think someones on twit said or on x or whatever that like they had the chance all these all these journalists were asking all these questions and nobody even asked about j pedros fitness at all no nobody even mentioned it so naturally nothing was said about it so is what it is and they havent said whether hes i dont think theyve given any specific update to if hes going to be back or not i heard it was something minor just to knock and he should be fine for the next one but well see so i am i benched cver in favor of porro attacking upside i thought and home fixture didnt think thered be a clean sheet for arsenal in there so i got i got bit in there a little bit but that sucks but saka getting return was decent coming in isa isac off at halim annoying hopefully hes fine this week the eye injury is what it says on so hope hes okay jotter again just a little bit disappointing he played 64 is minutes in the champions league so hopefully that means hell start again this weekend but he didnt look great in the champions league as far as ive heard so bourou for home is a great fixture for him but he needs to be scoring in the first 60 otherwise hes probably getting off with no points again so rogers as well like even last night in the champions league for villa like he started and at first he started he those 30 30 and he again didnt get any returns like all of the attacking mid all of the midfielders and watkins all got a return like a goal or assist and he once again got nothing and hes just flirting with any points isnt he just he looks good he looks good though i watched like the highlights of that game and hes always in dangerous positions and he obv did one preseason i think its just unlucky that he hasnt returned yet to be honest i have just s such a quandry of like who to start out him as smith row this weekend as well like im not sure that he could go either way hopefully well maybe isaac be injured and make a decision a bit easier for you but thats its its rough ill just bring up the some of the numbers from the weekend i think it was a bit of like a unusual one i just sort it by xg mateta was an interesting like one this weekend for me and other a owners it was irritating to see him take a penalty with something which i was like locked into thinking thats theres no question es on pens and another set pieces for palace so to see that like in the 90 whatever minute that he stepped up and took and then afterwards glasner said theyre going to be sharing penalties and its up to them toci side on the pitch i feel like matas such a big presence hes just going to take them anyway who was fou do i think it was it might have been s no i think it was s off top of my head i think he got the assist for the penalty so it wasnt even like he won it he played well and he i think its taken like that for me to think he could be a better option than e for like the well when palaces fixure is a bit better watkins was right at the top for xg as well at the weekend four big chances was the most of anyone im a bit jealous of not having him and you having him this weekend so but i feel like if it isaks out i do have the money there to go isach to watkins so youre not worried about his minutes hey watkins i think got that ankle knock but emry said it looked like it was going to be okay the john duran thing is there like he is like well but he did play 83 minutes in the premier league this weekend so his minutes in the premier league are at least trending upwards he looks like a beast doesnt he that goal he scored like at the weekend that was incredible that was amazing and that goal he scored last night that got ruled out was a cracking finish as well so maybe theyll get them starting together at some point but i just dont see i dont ever see watkins getting dropped for him like that just doesnt seem to be a thing like hes hes come in and scored two goals like when hes starting and hes just providing more assurance to emory that hes hes the nailed on starter so if they can find a way to play them both then great but is duran gonna be as good from the start in games i would say probably not but so i think im fine with his minutes as long as that angle thing in the champions league was not an issue like wolves at home absolutely great picture isnt it so good and i think at the moment ill be playing rogers ahead of smith r because smiths got newcastle at home which doesnt sound too bad either but rogers i surely this week hes gonna get something like hes gonna be a bit ofit troll isnt he but liking walkins at the moment and i think hes a good transfering for most people i think definitely and looking at some of the other numbers i was thinking about like as soon as munes was dropped to the bench and then last night it looks like hes definitely not first choice now cuz he played like in the a b team and i think he picked up a knock at the end so hes just been like tragically woeful for me and you were right that you said he just wasnt up to it and it was his like purple patch and it was in the im so happy i avoided him because i was i was so close to doing it and i just went for that j pedra instead and just j predra didnt play this week but hes been way up compared to mun i dont think munas has got any returns is he not even no hes got a single return in like the he should on paper have had like two of the easiest fixtures in ipswitch and leicester back to back and hes just hes just not done it so i was a bit disappointed about that but replacements i was thinking of like a who i would get in at that price bracket to replacing do you think if pedro isnt coming back for the weekend do you think welbecks a good a good shout this week his fixtures like longterm arent that great but im just trying to think if people are on wild card 6 whos there whos like a plum forward to get in this he could be we did just see liverpool blank against not and forest so the forest victure is probably not as juicy as we maybe think it was like thats the liverpool game has probably made me rethink that that this is so good to be honest or like well is theyre at home and brighton is scoring plenty of goals so maybe its not as bad as im maybe making out but im definitely going to be starting pedro im hoping hes fit but welbeck im not sure m should do fine his numbers from that like game were so awful i just didnt give any confidence maybe that brighton were pretty stifled like he had an xg of 00 and an xa of 02 and he only got like 70 minutes i was expecting 70 minutes but it wasnt i was expecting a little higher on both of those numbers i think if you havent gone well back already i think you just dont bother now to be honest no i no i think theyre theyre fixtures turn quite quickly after this i just had a quick look so after forest chelsea spurs newcastle and then wolves liverpool and city so the next run also you i personally dont mind chelsea and spurs like theyre theyre fine because theyre both not great defensively and then newcastle is be tough i think but then wolves at home but i think brighton are probably going to score against most teams and pedro and m you assume and well probably will be involved so i dont know is this fixture is a little bit like just worrying because of what liverpool did against them and al also while were still on strik as whist was someone who i was looking at for game week six got this ankle knock and hed been having like a great start as he 28 points in the first four game weeks and scored against city and highest xg of any like forward under like that 65 price bracket to have him not in the game is going to create a lot of opportunity i was quite interested in vard as a pick this game week thinking i know one we punts arent a thing before wild card but i just didnt like the idea of mo is potentially having a priz drop or just getting some skin in a different game but the fact that vards only had like three shots in the box this season and he scored them all just makes me think like how sustainable is that even against a very bad everton side so i was interested in vardy for a matter of about a minute vards goal scoring record in the premier league is top tier to be honest like whenever he has played like hes just gets tons of goals like 2122 15 goals three assists 20 21 got 15 goals 14 assists like 19 20 got 23 goals seven like before that 18 goals 20 goals before that 13 goals the 24 goals like every season hes in the prem like he scores so hes hes old now but like forms so far says hes just like if he gets the chances hell probably finish them i didnt expect him to come back and be like i know its only four games humle size i didnt come back expect him to come back into the league and be as i dont know as reliable as he has been two 90 minutes in the last two and i expect that hell start to play more 90s i think he played less at the start of the season because he didnt get much preseason but hes he surprised me in the fact that hes looking so n i think was it daa pon daer is meant to be like his injured longterm replacement but hes injured and hes in place over edward so but whats whats lesters like xg as a team its probably pretty low right lets have a quick look its like second bottom behind i switch or ahead of it switch so 33 is a big jump compared to i 15 but so its like his chances are going to be minimal but if hes going to finish everyone he gets then who get his first place absolutely just looking at the xgc of like expected goals con of this game week and everton up at 83 and theyve not played any big hitters either apart from spurs arguably but this season they played they played villa bournemouth and bri brighton as well so but there some of the results just whats whats the odds of like them going two n up again and then losing 32 i dont imagine if you put a bet on that like three weeks no theyve just not done well so far this season and leicester i wonder its a big weekend for like games at both ends of the table because youve got the this lester and everton game and youve got ipswitch and southampton playing each other based on like the start of the season those four right near the bottom for expected goals conceded down just number of points on the board so it could be a weekend to work out who is essentially going to be rel relegation candidates this season or this season and talking of like muns replacement dcl was one people started to look at as well but hes apparently ill so wont i think hes been almost pretty much nailed out ruled out sorry for this weekend which seems early for someone whos just ill on a wednesday or tuesday to be like hes ruled out of the weekend because hes just ill that seems strange to me but like his forms been okay like two blanks in the first two but then 12 points and six points and the two after that so he started to pick up some momentum and hes and hes been playing good minutes as well which is rare for him so he looks a little bit injuryf free at least so a shame look at the presses on friday or thursday whenever it is for them and hopefully he might get a pass of just being fit and people can get onto him so but i think he probably is a good options because those runner fixtures are good arent they its funny because if you if you someone that plays the fixtures which i am a little bit to try and like get on board of the form like someone like mcneel he just like no way an fpl like exciting pick but he has done well for that 55m bracket like hes hes on par with smith row if you were looking for a side sideways move and calv leen you just mentioned is or was performing at a similar level for slightly more expensive in a forward slot but its definitely not doesnt not exciting is he no i dont think id ever pick mcneil like ever just hes going to start blanking like he will score in some games but hes just hes just not an fpl pick for me no all right is there any anyone else you want to mention or should we just have a look at our teams for the weekend and some of our considerations what we might do lets move on lets go its a bit of a shorter show tonight so lets lets start with your team game five boys so at the moment i do have sber on the bench i was i was hurt by benching him last week they got three clean sheets out of four so far but it is man city away so that makes sense but maybe ill be bitten again on that but probably not i hope at le i hope at least they can stop harland scoring more than one that would be great so but s on the bench m wandry as i said earlier like smith row versus rogers to start is the only decision i have other than sl but s i think is just nail to the bench so who do you think you would go for at the moment im starting rogers because i think probably on paper that the smith rs fixture is harder but smith row showing way more maybe not such like form he is in form of like points but like rogers looks good on the ey test so i think youre probably right to be honest to start rogers wolves have been worse than newcastle defensively so i probably think i like that play to be honest id probably stick with it even though i think smith row has been good so far this season its difficult because youre youre picking you dont want to pick historical just because hes got points doesnt necessarily mean hes going to get some but then youre trying to base it on the fixture so i probably just about like a agree with you on that one to be honest sal captain probably the standout captain of the week bour for home great fixture bourman been quite good but they do concede goals at least so salah blanks last week its i just could see him being the first one to blank out of him in holland so unfortunate but blanks last night in the champions league so hopefully hes thirsty for more points this weekend thatd be good sacka you still going to play him i think he could probably get something against city theyre still liable to concede a couple j pedro im gonna start as well he should be fine like got decent enough back up on the bench isach unless i hear anything i think he should be fine too and its a good fixture hoping for points from trent porro has a decent up fixture but i think brenford will probably score and then dunk got home to forest i think its pretty good forest dont look that good at pack in and brighton have looked better defensively so i think on paper my team looks quite good hopefully this could be one week one week where i dont have to worry about holland no i think youre right is definitely one week you dont have to worry about holland i think with the double villa double liverpool and pedro i think youre pretty prime there if they have big games i dont see theres going to be like loads of rotation even though its like the first champions league week of the season but it maybe a little bit it was interesting that slot said last night that he was going to start gakpo in the game at the weekend but he came back a bit fresher so thats hints towards that hes he will make fresh lets say freshness based decisions in his front fre which is fair enough and youd expect that so j and j gapco coming off early at the weekend maybe suggests that jotter and gap cod could start but then diaz has been his starter in the premier league so i think it probably will be still so are you still thinking about wild carding soon or you quite happy because you not no plans to get harand still or have changed since last week no its still not changed but im thinking probably like a seven wild cup maybe eight just because i want to keep liverpool for those two six and seven with those walls away crystal palace away i might move j off at that time if he starts like getting benched but i want salah for so im thinking seven or eight okay what and then at that point you got need strong to still keep salah then and not have or just a bit too far ah had to think about not sure to be i might pivot at that point because whats hollands fixtures like after eight i havent even looked theyre nice they are well after eight let me just double check i know seven hes got fulham i think eight hes got southampton at home which is you a game youd probably want him for so no sorry southampton homes in n in nine so its wolves away in eight southampton then bouth brighton spurs then its is pretty good isnt it hes just got this tricky game next against arsenal which i think might be another nil or one no youre right i dont think hes going to do big hauling this game fair shame that im going to have to buy him for 153 if i if i go there i like the like that three odd million that im going to have to like downgrade someone to would be probably getting rid of trent in my team like that which doesnt feel great no i like it okay any more to say on that one no just watkins double race again would be nice id get the vice captaincy you probably havent said that yet vice captaincy on probably put on i think he him and rogers look good for this week so here i look at this and just think it looks like a mess but maybe it isnt too bad so henderson in go like you ive got trent porro and coner this week so typical as well like ive played coner twice this season against leicester and against everton and theyve conceded and then they kept a clean sheet in the champions league last night i was like come on man so frustrating so got that backline the midfield is a bit of a mix at the minute so you can tell its a salah and harand team recently ive got salah smith r minty and a e got another goal and assist last night in the league cup game so his numbers in non premier league competitions this season have been so good so maybe finally again united against southampton i know you didnt watch much of that one but i watched the first half and the game flipped when anana saved the penalty but they were so open against i can see palace winning to be honest i could see them winning as well like i think theres a bit of a but even though as a united fan there was like the huge result last night and they won at the weekend but i dont think from watching that southampton game anythings changed and i feel like if palace are on it they could easily win that game and that i think is probably a better game for ez to return a bit like that chelsea game where hes got slightly more space so happy about that min i dont know what to expect there munes has lost his place i feel like the team is looking like its ready for a wild card its like limping towards one could maybe this week but and leave some arsenal players on the bench but that would just be such a bad decision after taking a minus four last week just to get salah specifically for this so i dont think i can do that and then talking about isach i agree i think hes probably going to be all right if hes not im going to get watkins if munice is out ive got enough money to do winks to rogers and play rogers cuz i think that fixture looks good or i can get any full under like 6m and id maybe get jedro if he looks like hes going to be fit so theres a couple of different options to get on one of those fixures i dont necessarily like the double up against forest youre right because they were good defensively last week so maybe more likely i get rogers so ive got an attacking output in that game so well ill see about that what do you think or lack of attacking output in that game true ey test output i dont know what do you think you do with mois like definitely going to get rid of him im just trying to think who else is like thats why i came across like vardy and even dcl cuz i thought that game was going to be quite open but whats that evan nelsons fixtures for bourma i think theyre quite tough hes playing way against we got remember im probably going to wild card in game week six so they its only just probably going to be one week then hes only had one like three shots all season i dont know about that but i it maybe i think its probably him or j pedro no but im im pretty sure munis isnt going to start and i dont fancy robinson keeping a clean sheet against newcastle and it seems counterproductive playing isack as well so its either its either winks to rogers and plays three whos brenford got this week tottenham away okay would you consider that sharda guy because whis is out i dont know if hes a forward in the game not sure maybe im just no hes down as a midfielder 54 its a shame no probably not to be honest but hes someone i no i cant get i can get to rogers from winks i think ive got point six and jackson could you get there jackson what chelsea jackson no i think hes 75 is he that expensive i think he is 76 w okay so options are pretty limited but i dont know chris wood hes got liverpool hes got ntia nika maybe thats double palace attack and theyve not been like so i know it just its choosing from like a shower of so its either p vardy who hasnt got like great underlying data against a bad everon and rely on him getting one shot and scoring and getting nine points or get rogers be frustrated for an hour and get two or three points s in the chat but back calio punt im not sure hes a forward either is he i dont think he is he scored i know he did well in the i think he did well in the league cup last night i think he got a gold and two assist two assists let me double check caral now hes a mid hes 48 and hes he will be a great option once he starts to play in the prem he is a good player i do quite like that sh but i i think ill definitely know more for i want another week even though im expecting like another red arrow i think another week of just getting a few more just know a few more minutes ideas maybe some penalty takers i dont know well see winks to galo if hes looks like hes goingon to start and just drop mun to the bench could be okay i think it probably go that way so probably and captain c this week is probably quite easy i got sal to captain him this week while holland has this difficult awaken i think thats pretty straightforward isnt it this week i think its going to be one of those weeks where like the template bounces back about a little bit like most good players i think could get some returns last week was a bit of a drab one but this week i feel like hes just going to come back and trents gonna get his first attack of return and everyone will be happy this week no i feel like that happen sometimes after the international break like theres some funny results theyve been away so long its just just so gut like i cant believe already in game we four eight 18 points down off a hit gone just and when the hit includes trent and salah as well i was just thinking its never going to not come in hopefully that the guys on a youtube channel can get into the one million ranks at least sometimes too nice harry in the chat said not just us hes got 40 points and down 37m as well so hes going to keep plugging away but i feel like its its been a tough start and then i was having a look at like some of the i think fpl fol will maybe put on twitter like one of the account one of the people thats like 11th in the world made no transfers and the teams like fairly template and you just think god anyway must have harand does he have both i think he has just harland he has just harand hes probably got diaz in there he did have diaz and then he like he diaz was the only other and co will maybe were the only other non like template picks but it made me think blind thats quite like a template team and doing so well with no transfers i think hes 11th in the world man new pork jobs hes got a big at the back gabrielle trent porro and rea okay a lot of people have done well with raya havent they people wild card in game four or three all picked rea theyve been doing well on him his ownership is so high for a goalkeeper this season cool like sanchez at chelsea could start to be an okay west ham away brighton at home forest at home next three liverpool after that but then and new and united and arsenal after that so that four doesnt look great but maybe saves and stuff like that so absolutely all right any more to add tonight i dont think so just salah returns that would be great exactly i want big salah returns and smallish how returns what do you think the score in that game is going to be which one the arsenal city aral city game i think both teams score so like a 21 city maybe okay bit more probably har bracing it be honest he was poor against arsenal last season at the etad it wasnt nil wasnt it i would think surely like ca and gabrielle ted team can best in i hope its not boring though i feel like last seasons game at yes it was boring but i think its incentive for city to go for it because just because arsenal already points thats and they play thursday doesnt that suck they play thursday evening away and city play tonight at home in the champions league feel like thats an unfair advantage as well indeed anyway all right cool well be back next week thanks everyone for joining us this short show well back next week with a slightly longer one thanks so
