yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is f naturo and in todays video we are taking a look at those top transfers going into gw 11 were going to prioritize those premium forwards and some of those budget midfielders so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up as i mentioned i want to touch on these premium forwards because i think a lot of the conversation over the last few weeks has all been about the budget forwards chris wood kuna visa just to name a few but i do think we might be getting into the time of year where the premium forwards do stand out as the best value picks in the game in that forward department been a lot of talk about selling erling hland currently the most sold player and i do think there is justification maybe to come down from him not all the way to the budget forwards but this bracket forward were going to take a look at these four here dominic salanki of course off the back at that 16point hall in gw 10 congratulations to anybody that did keep hold of him nicholas jackson little bit disappointing in game week 10 but still putting up great numbers alexander isak a little bit of a rejuvenation were seeing the best of him over the last three games and of course ole watkins mr consistent so the big question is first and foremost who is the best one and then secondly should we be spending the money to come up from our cheaper forwards or downgrade from earling hland so first up we have to talk about dominic sanki everybody who kept hold of him were rewarded in gw 10 and i still think there are going to be rewards in game week 11 at home against ip switch its worth noting when we look at the actual underlying numbers over the course of the season so the opening 10 game weeks theyve been good i know a lot of people have been worried about him over the past two or three game weeks but again there are so many factors that we need to take into consideration if youre just analyzing the last few games and sans numbers at 063 per 90 have always been solid and whats interesting to me is a lot of people are saying that dominick sanki has been dropping deep being much more of a harry kane character linking up the play being creative well at 06 expected assists thats not necessarily paintting the whole picture so i still think he is a brilliant goal threat in this spurs team big chances at 127 as well is third second best on this list but still good regardless the big problem with salanki of course is that ip switch at home is brilliant but then man city away is that a tough fixture right now you could be the judge of that then fulham at home and bournemouth away now in terms of nicholas jackson i would argue in terms of longevity in terms of fixures this is probably the pick yes arsenal at home is not the entry point for many people but then leicester away villa at home and then southampton away is a good set of fixtures and they continue beyond that until the new year nicholas jacksons numbers very similar to that of sankis in terms of xg per 90 expected assists slightly higher and the same in terms of big chances so nicholas jackson is the same as dominic sanki but i would argue that jackson probably has slightly more rotation risk in the sense of christopher and kungu now jackson will start pretty much every game as long as he is fit but there is definitely the risk of rotation during this busy christmas period but i still think nicholas jackson longterm is a fantastic pick for our teams and he does a bit of both contributes in terms of the goals and in terms of the creativity in this chelsey team now finally the last two before we come to some conclusion alexander isach only just coming on radar he was the talker the time during preseason picked up the injury little bit of a slow start were finally seeing the best of him now 45 expected goals per 90 over these last 10 game weeks but we are as i mentioned only seeing the best of him now 08 big chances per 90 is a slight concern and i would expect in some of these better fixtures for that to improve but the big thing is are the fixtures worth investing in forest have proved to be a tough cookie recently so i dont think that is a great entry point west ham at home is great in gw 12 then palace away leaking goals then liverpool at home so i think similar to nicholas jackson you dont look to invest in this sa this week it is the case of next week finally oe watkins now at 9m we have to be confident and invest in an ollie watkins to pay the premium especially when we got people like salanki at 14m cheaper now the underlying numbers are great 075 expected goals per 90 he always is going to be the one that has the best numbers because we have seen it now over the last 18 months that this guy is consistently the man in this astonvilla team 15 big chances per 90 as well yes there is that hindrance in terms of john ran i do think he will steal minutes off him whether it be a start in one of maybe the next six games because we need to remember villa trying to manage champions league and premier league and a busy period i think there could be some rotation in oe watkins in either the brenford game or the following southampton game in gw 14 i believe so we need to keep an eye on that because john duran is definitely knocking on the door but one thing we need to remember is that john duran is taking minutes away from other assets in the team like a morgan rogers so i dont think watkins is just a direct rotation risk but his minutes are definitely a problem longer term in terms of those 90 minutes so to conclude we need to remember that gw 12 is probably the entry point for a lot of these forwards the case of jackson isach and ole watkins if you own dominic sanki i would absolutely keep and reassess after the international break if you have the funds available to go to someone like a nicholas jackson i do like it i think the chelsea team are good offensively i think nicholas jacks minutes are great and i dont see much rotation risk longterm for him as i would see with someone like a ole watkins alexander isach is probably the punt but 83m with callum wilson returning from injury very soon i will be a little bit concerned about isaks minutes over the christmas period as historically he is a guy who picks up a few niggles here and there so to conclude if i had to pick one right now i think it would be nicholas jackson however i do think very quickly alexander isach is going to be on everybodys radar i just think i want to see a little bit more from him and newcastle in general before we look to invest in him i wouldnt be buying olle watkins right now because of that rotation risk and salanki is a keep but i wouldnt necessarily say hes a buy let me know your thoughts in the comments section now lets take a look at some budget midfielders so next up i want to take a look at some of these budget midfielders in the game and the two out options right now are going to be morgan rogers at aston villa and seeno at bournemouth now of course both of these did score in gw 10 so that does help the case when we are analyzing both of those but they have both been over the opening 10 game weeks probably the stand out options now rogers being the slightly cheaper pick he originally started at 5m now up to 54m a real reflection on how good he has been 03 xg per 90 031 expected assist per 90 is ridiculous playing in an aston villa team who are always solid yes as i mentioned i am a little bit concerned about fatigue in this aston villa team and rotation with a busy christmas period and managing the champions league but morgan rogers has proved that he is a bit of a minutes monster and if anybodys going to get consistent minutes over the next eight game weeks i do think it still will be rogers in this aston villa team 21 shots per 90 is still solid and when we take a look at someone like seeno he has been an absolute monster in terms of shot volume 44 shots per 90 and 054 expected goals per 90 some ridiculous underlying numbers and even some creative numbers at two 022 expected assist per 90 and you can see the expected fpr points 613 and hes only delivered 451 so you would argue that hes been underperforming to some extent same with that of morgan rogers now when we take a look at the fixtures for bournemouth brenford away i dont think is a fixture we should be scared about then brighton at home wolves away who having their troubles then spurs at home and weve seen how good bournemouth can be at home against the big teams in terms of a villa little bit more mixed villa away crystal palace at homes great and i dont think chelsea away is too bad then brenford at home now if i was to invest in one right now i do think i would lean towards seeno if he had the funds available i think bournemouth longterm fixtures are good similar can be said of that of aston villa but as i mentioned just because of that extra game in terms of the champions league that they can have each and every week i think seenu is the one that slightly gets the pick but of course if money is a problem in your team and you can get to morgan rogers then i do think he is a great pickup the final thing we need to answer is in terms of a team structure i think you could have both of these in your team i think you could easily have someone like a salah another premium brian and buo or someone of that price and then have rogers and sanu as a fourth and fifth midfielder i do believe they are putting up the numbers to justify being a double up in your team allowing you to bench one of those if you have three forwards that do play and even in a week where you have to play both of those look at gw 12 you could easily play rogers and seenu together and i would even argue in gw 14 is it the worst case scenario if you played both rogers and seanu on your team i think the answer is going to be no so anybody that is in a position right now where theyre looking to wild card in gw 12 i would firmly consider both of these on your wild card which will then allow you to have some of those premium forwards that we previously discussed in the other section so let me know who your favorite is in the comment section for me it is just going to be antoan seeno now finally i feel like we havent touched on defend as much on these top transfer videos so i feel like its only time for us to get them involved and i have three budget options here for you lewis hall at newcastle c perz of bournemouth and man uniteds mazari now first up we need to talk about lewis hall because he put in a fantastic performance in gw 10 against b saka and he has been very good for newcastle start of the season we spoke about his value he then came out of the team for a little bit of a period but it seems like he has now established himself in that newcastle team and a 43m i think a lot of managers do need to have him on their radar so 023 expected assist per 90 is solid its the best of the three that were looking at here and the attempted assist per 90 at 168 he is being a bit of a creative option in this newcastle team he isnt just being one of those back three defenders that sits for buildup play he is being expected to kick on and contribute in the final third which is a real bonus at 43m when we take a look at someone like a kirz decent underline numbers 012 expected assist per 90 attempted assist at nearly one but he is getting a little bit shot volume at 075 per 90 much better than that of lewis halls and with balmer we know that they can put anybody at a game at home similar to that of newcastle finally we got mazari now this one a guy who youre bringing in just for the man united defense and i would say the man united defense havt been terrible this season and with a new manager coming in i would say mazari is more of the riskier pick because he is the more expensive of the three and youre very bringing him in with no idea where hes going to play now some people are talking about amaron will come in with a wing back system and that could mean that mazari suddenly becomes an essential defender in the game but also could the argument be he might even play as part of the back three and then all youve got is a center back in your teams at 45m man united shortterm fixures are great leicester followed by ipswitch and then everton at home and i do think if you want to jump on a man united defender it would be mazra but i think if youre looking more long term i do think lewis hall at 43m is offering fantastic value now of course the only issue we do have is could we eventually see dan bur stpp in at left back when botman returns quite possibly that is absolutely a situation that could happen but while lewis h and liament are putting in the performances that they are and newcastle are slightly turning the tide in terms of their overall results i think ls hall keeps his place in a 43m in terms of a gw 12 entry point at home against west ham i think that is the time to do so i think cirz for me i think bournemouth just away from home are unpredictable and i dont think i would want to go that id rather go lewis hall but again if youre looking for a defender this week i do like mazari as an entry point if you cant wait till game week 12 for lewis hall let me know your thoughts in the comments so finally we need to take a look at game week 11 and the predicted points because im going to put out that i think this is going to be one of the toughest game weeks for captaincy not necessarily because we have bad options i just think its a case of teams are very split right now we got some managers who are all in on earling highland we got some managers with no highland mo salalah we got some with no salah no highland and ive got people like son and cole palmer so it is very divisive going into game week 11 now you can see top of the list is going to be son at 73 predicted points as a manager that owns him i am delighted to see that of course the problem with son is playing 55 minutes in gw 10 is that a bit of a red flag now of course on thursday they do have their europa league game so we need to assess what exactly happens with son but again we have to paint our own narratives here if son doesnt travel with the squad is that good news is that bad news for me just to put my cards on the table i feel like s going off in the 55th minute he was surprised he was angry i think that was the sport doctors telling him that based on just the general science that we have nowadays i think with the richison injury i think sons minutes are going to heavily improve in this ip switch game unless we see anything bad on thursday night and im going to put my head on the line here and say i do think son is the best capy option i have to say that because of course i own him as well and itd be terrible if i dont captain him myself but i do think he is the standout option and i do think we will get 75 to 18 minutes of him in gw 11 now looking outside of son if you want to play safe i do think mo salah is the choice of 69 predicted points villa at home in gw 11 and with villa playing in the champions league i think they have been a little bit lackluster in the game after champions league fixtures and i think liverpool because theyre dominating the ball so much more in both the champions league and the premier league they are not getting fatigued like some other teams so i think mosalah is the safe pick for those that kept ear and hland youll be happy to know 61 predicted points yes they got battered in the champions league but i always back erling hen to score and if youre a manager that doesnt have son doesnt have mo salah i would still confidently put the captaincy on harland and not panic about it too much outside of that emo an interesting differential captain personally i dont love it i would much rather go for some of the premiums johnson again not a capy pick but still a great option for those managers that do have him and cole palmer at 52 again i just cannot put a capy on someone who has played a top team like arsenal outside of that if you want to go differential with salanki 46 predicted points a very interesting pick there so let me know who your captain is in the comment section ill be super interested to know and as always thank you so much for tuning in todays video if you have any questions pop them in the comment section and make sure you do like and subscribe to the channel and ill see you in the next one take care cheers
