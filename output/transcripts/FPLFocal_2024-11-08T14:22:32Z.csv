welcome back for another video final thoughts and final video ahead of the deadline were going to look at your biggest questions and dilemas this week well run through all the key news from todays press conferences to be aware for your teams and some final thoughts on my team in the final segment lets get into it first question from fabian he says do we put our dignity behind us and give up on cal leen i love how this ones worded dcl has been an utter failure in fpl no returns from six games on the bounce now he barely made it past 60 minutes last game not even guaranteed to start next game either but it sounds like theres a good chance based on dices remarks its west ham next who have kept just one clean sheet old season which was back in game 2 but in my of view its time to get rid of him the three forward ive short listed for your consideration are kuna strand lson and vissa with their fixtures below as well we know all about wolvess upcoming fixture run so we wont keep banging on about that but i would favor them as a dcl replacement k if you got the extra money strand l if you dont v also deserves a mention cuz his underlying numbers have been ridiculously good this season hes still got three decent fixtures bournemouth home everon away leester home but he is a shorter term pick you may want to sell him in like four game each time calin leen is statistically the worst finisher in the league over the last three seasons and thats where context is key although hes put up some reasonably good numbers at times his finishing quality is severely lacked wood for example the best finisher this season in the league in terms of conversion percent his underlying numbers have been similar to dcls but hes backed about six or seven goals after that run of dcl blanks drive through ar who are the best 45 milish defenders for longer term theres loads that ive got on the watch list so im going to pull them all up for consideration my favorite be eight nor hes not here hes 47 mil though make no mistake theyre not going to keep loads of clean sheets but hes by far the most attacking of the lot hes 47 mil so slightly above 4 and a2 its not a great entry point for quite a few of the 4 and a half mil defenders this week though i think that coner dun can coob all have potential to be great picks but not this week dunks injured as well probably back game 12 and fixtures are amazing for like six or so weeks likewise villa and chelsea come back from the break with a nice fixture run if you need one for this week then m rari and h would be the two ive picked out for 45 mil and 43 mil there were lots of questions as well about rico lewis replacement so this slide should be helpful for that if i had to buy one this week it be mai if i was buying one in gamei 12 it be cowell if it was gamei 13 dunk thats the order i put them in anyway theyre all very close to be honest big question from james harand stick or twist now last week my view was that with two free transfers switching him to a cheaper forward to fun sal was worth it but i felt that it wasnt worth a minus four though in the end har missed a bunch of chances and salah scored so even a minus four would have paid off assuming that your haren replacement was someone like k strand lson or isak who all returned im coming around to the idea of selling harlem but in my case its minus four but it does free up enough money for sacker and gic 12 for johnson so its a nee scenario in my case i do think amanus fall is hard one to justify unless it does leave you with enough money in the bank for a big upside move like that in game week 12 i wouldnt sell harlem this week unless it was to buy a s somehow personally the only other scenario where id consider minus four is if youve got a dud midfield like es injured then you could make the case for harand to or isach and then that injured or nonstarter midfielder to sal for minus four so for me i think its twist one more week and then likely selling gami 12 after the break if any of you watching have got harland and one free transfer whats your plan stick or twist the craziest part is over his recent bad patch re form hes still the best in the league for non penalty xgi over that run and hes almost regressed back to his xg total for the season in terms of actual goals scored having previously been on 10 goals from 557 xg my view in fpl these days is if a players consistently delivering elite underline numbers they will come good and id much rather a player of good underline numbers thats blanked a few times than a player thats massively overperformed in a purple patch salah is not in a purple patch his numbers are great but i think its a good point to make in general with fpl alon always comes to mind when he went on that crazy run of scoring like every week out of nowhere for like a month and then he very suddenly went back to the bad asset hes always been but i do recognize is more nuanced of harand cuz hes the most expensive player in fb history and isach and salah should outscore harland and rogers for example lets have a look at what the markets are saying this week projected goals by fixture and the clean sheet odds for gamei 11 graphic from rob t so looking at the projected goals tottenhams 29 is top of all the fixtures this week then its man united 245 liverpool 234 man city 205 so son and salanki look like awesome captains this week offering huge rank upside given the lower ownership as opposed to someone like salah and harland thats the fixure thats expected to have the most goals spurs are also top of the clean sheet odds as well theyve been given a 38 chance and then its man united liverpool and then its wolves west ham and man city tide im still in two minds about starting fabianski over rya though this suggests im about 4 likely to get a clean sheet which isnt a lot so if youre going to wild card in gic 12 over the theres some good one big punts on the table this week porro johnsons son sanki bruno p7 says that considering a free hit something along the lines of spurs players kya nori dow bruno and ask whats the best 11 this week this is just one mans view but id be reluctant to free hit in a single game week its so much stronger than the triple captainship which i think is more justifiable in a single game this season given that weve got two expected doubles as well this is the scout selection for gamei 11 they do a free hit team every week which comes from official fpl so lets try something new and look at that team and review it theyve got cells in goal v oldo 8 nor in defense salah palmer bruno and bumo midfield and then theyve got salanki kun wood up front its a pretty good team but if i was going to be free hitting i think id have son over palmer quite comfortably and id have pedro por over viio my gut feeling says that newcastle is going to be much harder fixture for forest so id also consider vis over wood as a onewe punt home to bournemouth lastly theres got to be some better goalkeeper picks for game mck 11 in isolation than sals anana kell and faki maybe let me know in the comments would you like the scout selection to be included in these every week moving forward or not interested last question and well move on panch asks is watkins a keep i do think an overlooked facet of villa this season is the immense challenge that comes with juggling the champions league and its new to pretty much the whole squad as well which could be why were seeing some results like a 41 loss to spurs and then a lost to club brugge midweek as well which their favorites to win its unbelievably hard to manage everyones fitness in the hardest possible schedule that said i look at villas games from game make 12 palace home chelse way brenford home southampton home three home games in four it doesnt seem like a rush to sell when youre on the cusp of some good fixtures the only player id consider selling him for is isach if youve got a bunch of transfers but thats a luxury move to me i might even buy watkins and get me 12 myself if i sell harland to emphasize that point on the fixtures watkins owners let us know in the comments are you keeping him or selling him right lets run through some of the news from todays press conferences then liverpool first so j remains sideline for a while slot said hes not going to train until one or two weeks after the international break so could be g 14 or 15 that he returns now allisons still out until after the break as well which we knew in case you missed it canate played in the champions league on tuesday after fears of an injury last weekend hes fine good news if youve got spurs assets posu says everyone came through the galatasaray game unscathed romeros got a chance of making game 11 hell be assessed wner mo vanen and richison all out he said the following about some we brought him back and in the first game he had a relapse what we dont want to do is put him back into that cycle again its very easy to do were managing his minutes and building him up he got a good 55 on the weekend and he got 45 last night hopefully we can build that up but ultimately its about getting him back and keeping him back so based on those remarks he might get around 75 minutes this game week lots of absentees of palace for their fixure against fulham could be good news if any youve got ral smith f or robinson even so and k has picked up a haming injury so he joins e warton and lura who are among those out injured plus will hughes is suspended for them maresco provided an update on palmer he said the following palmers getting better and we still have two days to prepare for the game hopefully we can have him for a session at least on saturday then we take a decision for the arsenal game chelsea versus nsal is the very last game of the gameing so its going to be a case of holding in him and hope he plays pep didnt have much to say at all his press conference he said greish is not available for saturdays game despite being called up by england he said he doesnt expect any returners this week so more or less the same squad that played in lisbon when they lost 41 to sport him savio started that one kb made the bench foden and harand vard and lewis also started final fb thoughts of my team then this is how line up for gami 11 ry vardo gabrielle pedro porro seeno palmer and bumo johnson wood kar and harand i keep going back and forth from fabianski and ryer as we as we saw earlier the bookies odds suggests that west ham are 4 likely to keep a clean sheet which is next to nothing so its still a coin toss i rate the arsenal defense so much higher but it is a tough game away chelsea theres big upside in double defense but i would be counting on the palmer blank so it occurred to me just this morning that if i was to go harand to strand lson and rogers to sah i have exact money to go johnson to sacker and get me 12 i somehow completely missed his path and im leaning towards doing it for minus 4 now it is quite risky cuz harlands massive ownership but salers probably would be even higher in terms of effective ownership but further to that id be exposed to international break price changes so if sacker was nearing a rise id have to go early on him as well its very tempting because then in gamei 12 id have a three premium midfield whereas if i was to roll and then make the moves in gamei 12 instead id be waiting till gami 14 to get sacka so a minus 4 gets me ahead of the curve id have to bench one of seeno wood if i do which isnt great probably have to be seeno would you be tempted to do it if you could get from johnson to sacker and gami 12 let me know in the comments pretty good depth on the bench this week with lewis and rogers if lewis starts anyway thanks for watching ive been working on a new stream intro which im going to use for the first time tomorrow you dont want to miss it well be live here around 900 am uk time see you all then
