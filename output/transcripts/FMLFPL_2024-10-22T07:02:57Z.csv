support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay wel to what are we up to here were back were back i feel like i still have an international break like breathing down my neck well i cant were back for four weeks only limited time only i know but it feels like im like is it next no is it two weeks no its three weeks its right there its right there its always right there isnt it whats up with you dude im chilling dog mets lost sad all day stinky i was too big busy at work with work today to be able to watch my dumbass team still not have won a game this season crystal pal november crystal palace fc football club and so i was very pleased to have been saved that torment i dont know if i could have taken a nil one loss if i watched the whole game so that was felt like i was like cast aside i dont i agree i dont think you would have been able to handle that game and you guys are a mess and glasner is maybe out i dont know i dont all right all right all right dont need to speculate on that what about you over on your side of the saying thatss i went into sunday thinking wow imagine if liverpool win in the morning mets win jets win ah one for three if you if you hit one for three you go to the baseball hall of fame so in some sense thats good whats cool is i know that youre on a pretty nice red arrow im on a small pretty nice i doubled my rank im on a small green arrow but we have the exact same number of points in the exact same rank we didnt get there the same way this week though come on thats cool though ive used all my chips i dont the chips over there im not competing its nice its nice its but were just aligned were on the same page same point same page same page lets look at team w 32 points one game gave me my points i just the tilting of holland like bringing him in after game wi five and just captain blank captain blank captain blank its hard thats been hard for me over the last its over a month since theres an international break every two weeks but thats been very difficult to stomach for we just well just say that but my villa guys were the only returns its just dib god seems to di god for those the uninitiated is tyler dibling i didnt realize that he just gets a yellow card every game definitely do without that hes just caught out of position and does some petulant every game cuz hes child kid and he just has a boner at all times i imagine because thats what we were all doing at 18 but everyones bad everything was bad saka didnt play kill me apparently did you see all the cartel on discord are you privy to that i saw a little bit of the chat on discord but im not on twitter and i dont understand or know who the actors are i didnt know until just now cuz a bunch of people were asking questions that with the word cartel in it and i was like are you guys talking about like stop and so ron said it was a thing on twitter at deadline tons of content creators advised all week to hold saka but last minute they transfer saka son there are accusations of insider info and off i dont know im having a hard i can feel myself wanting to get worked up over this and also its just like i dont care i cant care i dont know like are people just sitting there with these big text things and being like whats that like whos whats happening like this guy that guy and i think theres probably a whatsapp group and they thats probably exactly whats happening and its like a they have like a grand m theyre like a cult and theres got to be some cult leader and he sent beams out the signal saka to son everyone panics one second before the deadline does the move and gains plus seven or whatever the but who cares dude who cares its just like if youre watching or paying attention to what these alleged content creators of which whom were both of us hold saka like just dont know whats happen easy hes playing but like i just i cant be to follow some type of timeline of theyre advocating x y and z and i can understand the disingenuousness if theyre dealing with hidden information and then they have close contacts who are asking them to keep themselves secret and theyre winning money leagues because of it like well its its five points here six points there is one thing but i think its just the nature of like who are you trusting and whats happening and i could imagine that feeling bad and also at the same time its like this game is ridiculously stupid and they make up what the rules are as weve been saying for years week to week as they go along and some got an assist and then you got take away and i that we can im sure well get on to later but just stupid its a stupid game content creators like were all idiots we dont know anything its just youre just subscribed to the wrong podcast join us at fml we have no hidden information no secret contacts no whatsapp groups we just play the game play it as it lies we hold dibling we start soccer with confidence we go for how about you over there with your fly fl everton related 45 points thats how bad a week it was 45 feels like flying for and meleno dude is they came theyre coming in for you big time the true joy isnt just that i got a meleno 7po auto sub its that i had my bench order correct because there are a bunch of people on our discord who had s meno first on their bench and i was like thats on you we have very few actual manager decisions to make in this goddamn game and thats one of them and im so happy i got it right because i got the minko seven pointer pick for im glad you didnt ask me because i would have said definitely seeno over michael eno okay dangerous well you told me he missing big chances on red card for an hour and a half for fun so thats maybe prash but sanu got a big chance he got he got his one big chance i brought in foden and archer didnt get rid of saka got rid of shot ali instead so i barely came out positive there i just knew i wanted to get rid of oi out of my no one heard or a lot of people didnt hear the patreon pop but it was more like who am i gna want to get rid of the most as i move towards probably two premium midfielders with holland but that might all blow up because holland might be the worst pick in the game but that aside i knew oi was probably first on my kill list so i just wanted to do that while holding saka in a good fixture jokes on me doesnt even play and then ill wait till this week when arsenal of liverpool to pick my other premium is why i did that but archer np pointer genius move amazing great pick great pick amazing and somehow roger shot wasnt an unle but we take those i dont know what the the rules are i dont those ones when they take the shot from that far away you cant like what are you going to get some physicist to draw some like its like a splatter bloodline you as you said its made up its lit like the rule is stupid because that just its an own goal by any sense of logic like the ball doesnt go in the net unless it hits basss fat ass therefore it should be an ole but i dont care i got the points october mug le leaders one more game we to go this is from f game we because i dont know if the games updated yet probably not theyre probably still adding an assist alex parry aka wack fc in first sea whittle aka gardy always on time and in third kyle shepard aka post thought xg love that shout out to the public league leader seth stillman aka felix fc dude where are we going where arent we going this is going to be a long one thats all i can say i think we should start with man city the champions sure the gold badged frauds so were a few games since the rogery injury yep they cant create a big chance theyre losing an xg they cross 40 plus times a game and do nothing and play for corners yep what the are we doing here it just feels insane i dont know i dont know its a multilayered question because everyone has holland and then everyone has pretty much everyone has at least one defender leis or gard most people so lets start with the holland 15m question lets start with holland jitb said is it better to roll this week to maximize potentially shipping out holland in 10 because everyone should know theyre home southampton and nine so were not getting rid of this week and then ethical said any doubts creeping in about holland after southampton 152 buys a lot of stuff in the squad so im thinking about it its its weird with holland because i think that the reputation that he has especially like this season last season is like he just gets the final shot and hes so good at finishing so all he does is score goals and he never touches the ball otherwise but when he was on dortmund he was like incredible at many things not just shooting so good in buildup so good on the break so good at all the time but pep has constructed this house of cards this delicate balance of this that you dont do that in this system partially because i think they get no transition opportunities ever against anyone well also it conserves his energy it conserves his energy keeps him fit which was always a problem and now were just looking at this team where im just like i never expect him to score hes bad in the air i know hes big but hes bad in the air hes bad at headers and all they do is get it to one of their goddamn dribbly wingers and cross and then the cross gets headed out by some dawson and they take a corner like theyre bad right now theyre worse than theyve been for years right now its you cant argue against that like the last few games are i think probably the worst three game i could maybe mis misremembering some of the roder outs periods that theyve had over the last handle years but the last three games from city are about as bad as you could possibly imagine them of looking in i think it was like it was interesting the minute gish came on he stopped like goku i dont want to upset you off please go off were getting were getting pak jus naas here hes gonna be in spain playing fullback in five the minute that guish came on and realize like let me float these crosses to the back post instead of just spam them into the guy immediately in front of me to win a corner they were like all they were kill like for those 15 10 minutes it was like theyre scrambling like wolves dont know what to do and they were like some late runners and like so that was one thing i just noticed dku and savia were just carbon copies of each other who just do a lot good middle third build up foul blah but when they get the ball to feed at the final third theres just no movement theres no onew passing in the middle of the area at the top of the box like lamina just shut them down and gundo looks beyond wased hes just so slow hes just so slow like its not even like his body but almost like his mind as well hes just he seems like hes moving at half speed and b also just was just pedestrian and kovich he his weaknesses were being exploited just not moving the ball fast enough and they just keep getting the ball to reuban at the top of the box and no one theyre just and they just didnt they could just didnt do anything weve seen this game reminded me there was a southampton game that they played against maybe like three years ago where they won one nil at the death on some cross and i think they put in like 40 crosses in this game i dont know if you remember that game like a couple years ago i no i cant remember it but theyve had this in their locker youre talking about the rogery aspect from certainly thats an issue the kevin aspect was also what weve been talking about and him missing the last four games and like it looks like he picked something else some new thing up after he trained for one day so its like i have im im like of two minds where its we see these last few games and you dont not only not want holland whos 15m but you dont want a city player you dont anyone and then also the thing that we talk about all the time is they have worldclass players and the best manager in the world so theyre not going to just keep doing this like theyre gonna improve and start scoring again because theyre gonna either win the league or finish like second so i dont know like im im conflicted in that sense of like yes holland looks bad and redistributing him to get an extra premium feels genius but then i also look at it and im just like are we back to trying to play the game on hard mode by taking a three sample size game period and extrapolating it over the next 30 thinking like hes bad like hes not bad hes not bad its just its just like a ridiculous thing i dont know what to make of its like i think part of it is also just like you like the reality of the premier league right you have no time ever to train especially if youre in champions league you have one day a week max to train and all you have time for is like lets prepare for the next opponent you cant like adapt and what happened when they lost kevin and roger at the same time is just all of their passing is out of the team theyre two best midfielders by a long range but also just the type of midfielders that they dont have to replace because like kova is good we like kova fodens good we like him savos look good every game but theyre all rico is good theyre all just like dribbly boys and no one can pass and like you were saying they just recycle possession recycle how many times because i went back and watched the second half how many times they get it to kovic who i 50 times and all he does is try and win a foul he just tries to like up trick you hopeful wolves guy sticks his foot and win a foul and then they get a free kick from 25 yards great and guess whos not scoring if all they get is corners in 25 yardage is holland so like you said i agree peps gonna think of something because hes great but right now its just like get out of here like get out of town its just hard to its hard to imagine theyre just going to turn it turn it on at a nowhere and just like starts creating huge chances everywhere i think its also ian i didnt have holland for very long last year i was did it very badly at the game as i usually do but i didnt have holland for a long time and it just felt like paddling upstream the whole time because he you we were accurately not captaining him in the away games and the nonhome bankers and he did have that the away wolves game ironically last year was when he had five returns i think they had two pens and i was that was fun for me not having him in that game but like if youre looking at his run after the southampton game this week which i do want to talk about as like is he the best captaincy option but looking past that they dont have a good home banker against a bad team i dont know if everton is bad they tend to fall apart against the good teams but thats game make 18 and thats like were looking at almost 20 were almost like 2025 their home games after southampton are spurs nfl man united everton a lot of aways in there and then they have west ham 20 at home and then some aways so i dont know its like i think you need to commit and look see am i happy to may be captain this week against southampton and then hold and not cap for a while unless if things change or get rid which either way you can make very cogent arguments i think against for other cases right and im leaning right now towards getrid like you were saying like everton normally im like theyll score five pep d thats what happens every year imagine im ining them crossing 45 times against everton just like i cant watch that i cant captain a guy in that game because tco and bran just heading balls out all day like thats das dream as you crossed that so i just i looked it up while youre were talking so how many times is man city under pep crossed 40 or more times and its 12 times thats crazy in like should be like three 400 games it should be less than that thats very little like i dont i havent like looked specifically into these matches like maybe theres red cards or weird but the results are horrendous when they do they have two wins in these 12 games so like some its almost a clear indication that something is just very f broken if this ever happens and its happened twice you it just happened and no it didnt happen again this season but like the other games were just as bad it feels like its happening it feels like its happening all the time so youre youre more leaning towards getting right after southampton and just spreading it around more i think so which i used two of my four free to get him fed and now im just like i do feel a little bit but like ah god i wish i just had my freeze because like i maybe would have kept olly like thats some like i dont you dont need any money if youre ever getting rid of holland so but i figure it out i dont know im im leaning towards holding him okay i just holding and not capping holding and not because i feel like i can do i feel like i can do that fine in a fine way and not like forsake too much just by spreading it around because i think you have your two mids that you need or whoever to have the like whether its sun or mo or palm god or saka or whatever like its not like were were spreading this around from so many players and i just feel like it just changes so fast right like we after the arsenal game in game week five were like all the entire preseason everything we learned from last year were sitting here like never captain him in away games only captain them in home bankers and after five games of watching them destroy everyone and him do all the things all the time at newcastle home full of at wolves two away games two one medium home game and he just blinks them all and now were talking about getting rid of him and i just like a good point i cant oscillate from extreme to extreme and ahead and im just like i dont know hes good theyll win a pen periodically right like i just hes just like bumo now hes just im just like forget him like maybe they play well against bournemouth and brighton and im like game m 12 home spurs ill just like ill just captain him because things change in three weeks or its after the international break and hes i dont knowbe vodin will change things maybe cuz i cant imagine its so savio and doku and like that would that would blow my mind so its got to be like jack and foden and maybe another midfield try i think thats a good point because like you said and this was totally a preseason note of mine is like when team when things arent going well you should expect the manager and players to make changes and when things are going well you should expect the opposite so what are we doing southampton though so youre thinking not capting because said what three city players should we have for their upcoming demolition to southampton and ethical said do we get foden for southampton i its still the best fixture in the league home ip switch isnt far away ip switch have fallen off the whatever they were on they look bad now no greaves who plays them bumo youre going to cap buo over holland i just said theyre the same player im think about it i am thinking about it and hopefully bu just put everyone off the scent because he was so bad at man united maybe last time i c booma i worked pretty good home south home southampton for city is like you expect them to just give them goals for fun but also im just like i dont they do i think its its just its a consideration i think you still probably are supposed to in holland they play midweek well see what happens well revisit at the end of the week but i also wanted to come back around on city the defense dude we got to talk about the defense we have to talk about the defense like look vard bangs a off foot top bins worldy which is an actual laugh riot joke that even happened but its a joke but also like at what point are we like hes just a donger like i him not scoring five plus goals a year at this point im just like hes gonna no thats fine thats fine g hell score his few goals a year but the defense is ridiculous its just so bad they have one this year through eight and theyve had many very easy many easy games its the thing thats insane about watching them play is like their like xg whatever isnt that high but theyre not like letting up low xg chances in accumulation its like its not that high and theres like a few enormous chances that make the low number overall and i just feel like every time i watch them its like without roger like they just either the backline drops off or someone falls asleep or someone cuts in behind or and its just like its a matter of when its like they let up between two and four absolute gigantic chances every single game and theyre letting up the least amount of shots per game and the second highest quality chances per shot to switch that doesnt work theyre coning theyre just getting run right down the gut by whoever the fastest player is on the other team doesnt matter who saato or adama or whoever the and it happens multiple times its so easy i feel like for these teams to play against them which without r its without roger and like the and not having walker there for the recover pace which makes up for a lot they have ruban still somehow the year 2024 he still plays every game he cant move and stones is still playing in the backline just put him at striker godamn play him up in the box but like even if its a kanji or stone it doesnt matter theres just no pace in the backline and ricos just like a little small guy and even when he has some pace but he just get shug off the ball by any player so theyre theyre just a mess and like i vardal look i got it we were talking about it a couple weeks ago the fixtures and but hes just not a good pick like i get the dong or whatever like i dont care like the way you watch this team and youre not spending six million on a on a defender period youre just gonna be lucking into points if he keeps doing this it just theres no sustainability and rico like we talk about ricos always good compared to the other four fs well hes still taking up the spot on your team hes still getting no points and maybe hes not like maybe hes not cuz he just doesnt do anything like he does and also like its the same right its it works the same as i just said with holland and it works negatively for the defense right if something is not working you should expect it to change so like he started three in a row great theyve been awful in every game and conceded in every game and are lucky he been a big reason why and theyre very lucky to seven points very lucky and he could get dropped he probably will get dropped like just waiting for kyle or gonna put a kanji back at right back or stones back at right back hes gonna try stuff to fix it and its just hes so lightweight like ive been watching him very closely in the last handful of games and he just hes annoying to watch hard to watch he they he changed his role in the second half he was playing a lot more deep in the first half but like he just he just goes into this little half space on the right mid right striker eight fre eight side whatever he just doesnt do anything he just stands there he comes he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass he maybe hell make a couple of maybe forward passes but broadly speaking he just doesnt shoot he doesnt create anything he just doesnt do anything and i dont care what his price is i think hes just a bad pick and theyre not keeping clean so hes been frustrating and i think im im like past my boiling point with him i think after southampton if he starts midweek i might get rid of him but im im im im very concerned about him and very concerned about the defense at large and especially because rogers roger didnt strain his hamstring hes out for the year out for the season so why are there why is there clean sheeter defense prospects going to improve theyre not going tole that goes back to the pep thing right its like clearly whatever theyve done to address the rogery kevin double injury has not worked attacking or defending eventually theyre going to put up some good performances keep a string of cleans win a bunch of games i think theyll get it right but until then hes just a bad pick fs a bad pick edersons a bad pick but do you think that hes gonna start dropping off and playing cuz to me when i look at the squad and the players they have available what they should be doing is playing deeper and coning possession more and trying to get holland in space and trying to break thats they havent played that way since peps been there like whats he gonna do like i i dont know what hes going to do make one of the midfielders stay deeper make bilva be the deepest midfielder hes done that before relying on like gundo and kovic like its eight years ago and theyre going to cover all this ground and win the ball and its just not realistic at all i think that like as much as he loves gundo like a son hes just gonna watch the tape of the games and just be like good god this is not working at all all right i honestly stones in midfield is like not i dont know why he hasnt something like that like could do that could do that okay citys a mess citys a mess somehow they have all these point how are you feeling with rico you have rico as well he stinks most defenses stink we did get questions on that j phoenix said who are the best defenders calli said i have trent and poro both seem like problems what defenders are good right now which is we can go towards liverpool we can go towards arsenal with the discussion we can talk about spurs but like which defense is good right now is a real question and its hard to answer list liverpool nf liverpools great the hardest pictures in the league i think nfo also is very easy like nuno team playing well theres no reason to not trust them to just keep some cleans they keep keeping cleans theyre good but theres very few teams very few teams that i trust i want to say that i do still trust arsenal i do these red cards are dumb and etta teams for some reason get way more red cards than everyone else but do you feel the same way or are you like wavering with your arsenal guys the missing personnel is starting to compound for me like odard missing is something we almost have as like not even its it happened so long ago that we dont even realize it but he is the most important player like he does everything for them getting going forward space pace intelligence like he just does so much for them that every injury past him i feel like its like it makes such a huge amount of difference and like theyre just players are just trying to do too much almost right where everyone is trying to play like an extra an extra gear and then they look just like an extra gear worse because of that almost saka misses a game and the defense has just been i trust the defense from a systemic standpoint of like how he has them set up and the control hes trying to output influence but dude they like havent played with the same back line i think twice all year almost if you like they its white back which is nice but but like now like gabrielles played all the games right he started every game other than that its like white timber cba calori zenko played like its just i think gabrielle and cba have started every game celba just got the red but white just came back timber now is her cal fury started starting but hes played i think both on the left and the right or has he just played on the left i cant remember exactly but but then its its that compounded with like wheres rice playing wheres tom playing is george marino marino is new he doesnt know what the going on and its just all of a sudden he played kai in midfield a game or two here or there right and all of a sudden its just like all of the its just so many moving parts and the thing that made them grind everyone else to dust last year to me was he played the same 11 all year like every game he had every like 3000 minutes from like nine players or whatever and everyone just did the same thing and it was unstoppable and now they have a fixture pile up and they have injuries and im not like that confident i still i still like them a lot but youre also paying an absolute up the noose premium on them right barck said do we sell our arsenal defense especially if were doubled up no cleans in the last three pretty disappointing next three dont inspire much confidence and jeff said if you have double arsenal d are sick of it do you dump rya for pford or gabrielle for lewis well forget about lewis we but i just feel like thats also insane like to get rid it just feels crazy to me right im im right there with you its its it is crazy and these red cards someone posted in our discord like they have way more red cards than any other team since artetta got there so like i dont know whatever hes injecting them with before the game its too much he needs to dial it back the aggression and the stupidity but theyre not going to keep getting reds its its not possible and they do still have cleans well its also like the southampton leester concessions are nonsense right they were they were not both all three of those goals were absolute ridiculous banana and nonsense goals so they were in complete control there and if they kept one clean in those two games lets not even say both right youre sitting here and youre saying like theyre just they have four cleans in eight and but its just that with three red cards with three red cards like and look they do have tough fixtures upcoming they have liverpool newcastle chelsea pressure makes diamonds like they are good at cleaning tough games because they have to be on it and theyre not complacent and gabrielles sticking his finger up the enemys bum holes right you have to you have to so i dont care that much about that i just feel like if you have them you hold them and if youre looking to make money but also its just like for who like i would like to see that team but i think it all goes back to the overall belief that both of us have which is just like i dont want to touch my keeper i dont even want to touch my defenders theres too many high upside premium attackers who are amazing getting quadruple returns and like thats where i want to use my transfers my biggest problem is never gabrielle or rya like theyre just going to get cleans and get points like dont care but i do think liverpool maybe are leap frogging them for best defense in the league honestly after watching the chelsea game theyre the chelsea game if anything like confirmed that we should believe in the defense cuz like they just are like you can have the ball as much as you want were not going to were not going to get baited by this press ever and were not were not doing anything risky were just going to stay in shape and youre going to do nothing and they can see the one nico chance and he does a good finish and can you could look at that and interpret it any way you want second clean sheet can canate has given up of the season but theyre great if you concede one chance thats good well get to liverpool for the other two arsenal questions vikings said kai do we sell or hold arsenal playing a lot with 10 men fixtures about to get tough who are the good replacements and then golf said does arsenal have a stench who stenching its not stench levels come on we gota we got to relax with that theres still maybe best team in the league like theyre still so good but its just been a up start to the season i dont know where what are you feeling about with kai hes eight3 right now he has four goals one assist through eight where you at i think its a i think its a transfer out i dont think its a emergency youre insane if you transfer him out hes a good player hes going to get returns but do i want him in home liverpool at newcastle at chelsea home nfo like the answer is no i dont want him at all in those especially if saka is out we know od guards still out but saka to me saka is by far their most important player and if hes out they just have nothing relying on like trossard to make the killer pass and marino to do stuff in the box im like get out of here martinelli martinelli off so well they play midweek so well have a better idea well have a better idea after champions league but for me for me its a transfer out gaming 13 talk to me about kai talk to me about saka we ill be interested again ill be back but thats exactly what i was just trying to say about the defenders is like i want to use my transfers here because i see i could move to someone get more points more goals or double change and make him at a premium mid maybe a captaincy option if were not captain holland etc so yep thats where i want to go fair as for which forwards chris wood is isnt it so obvious god it just is its just so ridiculously for the next four if you dont include gameing 12 when they play city when they play arsenal you just you start him in the in gimick 9 10 11 13 with a lot of confidence he could have braced today easily he has pens hes great i dont know what to say it does feel overthinking to not have what at this point is insane is it if you told me this two years ago like youre going to be doing this podcast in two years its gonna be like december november and youre gonna be saying chris wood is one of the most obvious fors in the game like youre transfer your arsenal for to chris wood youre insane but its close i all of a sudden theyre just like the forwards there are all these budget forward options putting their hats in the rank and there then thats it wiissa strand coa like jim jim i forgot about jim we got questions about these guys too i all of the above would you rather buy dom or jim or wood thoughts on cheap forward shan larson versus jim versus wiissa do you have big preferences on these because jim also his form is just unbelievable it was a little bit of a weird one where you got the goal kick assisted goal and he had another little half chance here there but i think wiis is the best of the of the bunch honestly just looking at the fixtures and looking at the player home ip switch at fulham homeborn with at everton home lester easily the best pictures of all the pretty good hes 59 and hes done it before and i think that the player is good bren hammer a little bit mix bag and but theyre getting theyre getting fitter and the npcs are npc so i like wia the most i like that i like that i think strand is probably second because this fixture runs just longer my thing with wood that im a little bit uncertain of how to handle is like you want to transfer out youre gna want to transfer him out soon because the run gets bad fast so like if you dont already own him are you buying him over these plays im just not because again its similar to a defender right you dont want to use your transfers on the spot right its at lester home western home newcastle at arsenal home iip switch then it gets bad at city at united home villa at brenham spurs everton w liverpool so so after the next youre looking at the next five and you probably have two and a half good ones arsenals bad and then what theyre going to lay an egg in one or two of them but i dont know i just i feel like hes hes all of a sudden like just going lower and lower on the power ranking as his run declines its like the length of his run it impacts the quality of the pick a lot i think i rate tran larson just like pure ey test i just think he does a lot of good stuff and i honestly dont think wolves are that bad i know that they have no wins bottom of the table all the and they have the hardest ever imaginable schedule so far and i just think theyre very im not saying theyre good but i just think theyre like okay like theyre whatever they have some guys they can move the ball into the final third they can cross the ball and i just think he just played against every best team in the league like the top five at least and he doesnt have to play against them anymore he is for his one and two hes one and two so i think hes great hes the cheapest of this group i think now hes 55 longterm hold like you said you dont want to use a transfer on this spot and you will not use a transfer on this spot until maybe gw 19 like that with trent larsson so thats as good as you can get i think even though he doesnt have pens still good and which would does have its because interesting would and d have that well dcl is something else but thats also like looking at wood and wiissa because they have like a similar convergence of like they have the next few good fixtures and then it gets bad and like i dont know wiissa not having pens versus what having pens its it does make a big difference and then its its almost like you going to just are you resigned to make a transfer in december on the player or not or is this a rotation and you have to look at your team and think about like how am i seeing the season how am i going to play how am i whens the i think what you have to do planning wise is like when is the next time i want to rotate out my premiums like when is the next triple three transfer week because that impacts if you want someone whos good for four game we or if you want someone whos good for 11 game weeks right totally like im on three free now im sure im going to use at least two this week i think assuming like saka is hurt ill probably get rid of kai ill move to a premium mid whatever but im going to want those arsenal guys back i think game we 13ish like that 13 14 just for a pretty long good run of p and i still like them both a lot so i cant think of it as like ill just get wood and then ill move him to strand larson and then ill move him to blah its like no i already booked all these transfers like im getting the arsenal guys i dont i have no freeze is like how i should be looking at it and ca is also there 65 like hes hes who we presumably believe to be on pens for wolves is that correct i think so as cabia doesnt play anymore he doesnt play anymore so hes also a pick there right but its also just like where is the meta moving like do we want to have we havent mentioned salanki 77 talk about him and spurs or but just a note on this like how many it seems like everyone should have at least one sheep forward like but should it be two the correct two like that is that the best now five mids maybe maybe but because it also in the back of my mind like watching eso im just like im gonna want to get him soon he should have braced he should have braced he should red and this is they play chelsea and arsenal and then nfl away which isnt we thought would be good but is not and then they have a pretty good run forever so im just like also looking at that like well every he was in 60 of teams in game this is the guy dude didnt i say this is the we learned our lesson with rich last year and were going to forget about him guy and hes gonna like they dont have a slam dunk run of fixtures at any point they have like just enough to splice it up to make it look not so good but like he goes back to one of those where he plays once a week i dont know if calums going to be back at some point and maybe hes wing and then who knows but like hes playing once a week and has pens and theyre looking competent again and everyones getting fit again so like hes also some like well i want to get him soon and like if i go down to all these six million forwards like what am i doing so its and also like if isach is who everyone thought he was at the beginning of this season everyone knows he was at the end of last season i dont give a if they have two hard fixtures in 10 or whatever like he could score in anyway he was unreal last year so it doesnt even matter i like that shout a lot starting in 12 this incredible run incredible run its just theyre only definitely hard one is home liverpool and even that at least its at home the rest are good till march february whatever good so i love that shout i love that shout and they honestly played well against brighton they should have won the game for sure you have spurs stuff because you watch that match im only living on highlights but to get four goals with no bj involvement no dom involvement the fluky own goal assist then is taken away weird goals and weird game yes it was a weird game weird goals its just so much more down to western being so diabolical to me than spurs being good spurs probably they could have scored six you would have been would have been chance that he hit off the inside of the post and they let the foot off the gas for the last half hour like they stop stopped playing but subing mat early was very interesting one there subbing him at half its its just they just attack so much right they just relentlessly attack and they barely play any defenders and the defenders that they do play are all fast and play at the halfway line so dogs is in the box the whole highlight the whole highlights he was in the box and por shooting from distance like it was either one or the other doing that so sun was like also just very pedestrian to me like as i used to seeing him be where it just against a good defense he just blanked easily comfortably blanked and against west ham its just like he looks like a world beater where his shots that weve been watching him just get blocked all season are just like going through or whatever and ariol had a bad game arol is hes hes passing to the other team but you just looking at their fixer run in the thursday games its just its hard to ascertain like is this is this a buy is this a is a sell like hes 99 now he just went up today they play home it if switch and 11 which weve been talking about is like a good captaincy game but other than that its just like its like some good some bad if hes playing on thursday and theyre playing on sunday its like its not great youre stacking him up against all of the other players saka palmer oi foden holland you can only have so many of these players so presumably as pens do they ever win pens the answer is no so theres a player thats on pens that doesnt win pens on pens i dont know its like tree falling in the tree falling in the woods if no ones around to hear it but i dont know im just still very lukewarm i dont know its its very bizarre like i just feel very lukewarm im less lukewarm again im only on highlights didnt watch the full game but i do think that like a lot of the west ham looking diabolical is what spurs do like thats what their thing is press you win the ball in the third make two passes get a shot off whatever theyve been scoring a lot of goals lately a lot of goals and i think that like fen didnt even start so i dont like what are we even talking about when were saying like foden versus palmer versus son its like he doesnt even start and he got a lucky assist at in the 95th minute so i dont even know if he should be in the convo but to me the question is like palmer in newcastle man united arsenal or son in palace who are a bottom three or four team right now home villa ips switch and to me that answerers son its fair because i dont know what to make fully out of the liverpool chelsea game was a complicated game but what liverpool did to palmer was just like hey guys heres the blueprint if curtis jones can just completely mark him out of the game and score a goal and get an assist but just like curtis just humiliated him i feel like he just wasnt also could have easily scored a goal like he had a good no he had that one good chance like that was the best chance that was blocked and he did nothing otherwise and it was just like okay new newcastle can do that can man utd do that like probably not like theyre just bad but and they have no midfielders that can run around that much but arsenal and newcastle can surely do that like got i dont know im just i want to wait for 12 for palmer is what im getting at here where he will just bully these bad teams and he will get more space and time on the ball and when he will get another quad return or whatever the hes up to and i look at these harder games a bit differently after that liverpool game so sun suns a pick son hes definitely a pick you still just can back door into the he has pens so you have that going for you pens a lot of attacking a lot of shooting sure sure youre just trying to find your braces and i think he has a better chance of braces in the next run that a lot of people asked about sun fod and palmer saka etc jeff d do we prioritize palmer or mo or sun to replace s i havent even talked about mo slim said i want to ask you guys do you think its mo to palmer still thats still a move to make no question right i dont know what do you think between all these premium mids like who what do you think is the priority whats your priority i think the priority is the fixtures its just its all so much of a muchness like you look at mo as like if he didnt take a pen he just didnt do anything like he created two and no but like you create two and a half chances like okay whatever maybe youll get a sixpointer youre not looking at the doors are being blown down like my god i dont even did he even have a shot like other than that like two shots maybe would be my guess open play he had he just didnt do anything besides the pen but so the pen is papering over a lot of cracks i think with the mo the mo argument and its similarly with sun like if he got the fake assist and youre looking at this like huge double digit hall where its like whatever you make you make he also had that humongous chance that he almost he finishes nine times out of 10 that hit like the inside of the post and bounce across the go line like my god thats true thats true i think its more like you just want to play the medium the like next four to seven game we fixture run of im gonna hold this premium for this period of time and then im gonna get this other premium in this spot for this period of time because you you can do as much analysis as you want of like which premium player gets point like saka is so good in hard fixtures its like i dont care i still want him for the easy ass bad fixtures and id rather have like sun in home bankers than salah who performs well in hard fixtures for a hard fixture run so its like every time and like thats where i feel like you want to try and angle yourself towards so that you have the rest so the answer is sun and foden right well foden i think is a little bit stickier because is what the we dont know if hes starting he has no avenues except for we dont know if city are good we dont know if theyre good so thats messier but i think its probably i think its just its just messy like i think we all have holland i think its certainly sun with the fixtures in the in the near horizon and then its probably like palmer and 12 or maybe sakade or maybe palmer now like watkins i dont know its youre going to have to take a couple of bad fixtures on the chin here because if youre looking at just shortterm like next three its sun and theres no one close for me like between of all the premiums like between liverpool arsenal chelsea villa like its son after that i think it dovetails nicely with palmer and thats like immediately where ill go in 12 no nonnegotiable sun could score 500 goals the next three matches and hell still make the transfer i think its team dependent too there because he loves playing that city and i think thats a good sunf fixture and then home fham at bourem like i think you could hold him past that i i am sitting here with foden in my team saying ill transfer him out like maybes a nightmare fodens probably gonna always be a worst p than sun unless if hes playing southampton i switch like two or three but but i think its also you look at your team structure and figure out like what am i doing with my team structure how many how many premium mids holland and no premium forwards or you im g have watkins or kai or whatever and going from there and figuring out like where am i sending my transfers for sure okay we got some liverpool questions but mainly just about the defense cink said if you have both which you do would you drop trent or robo i know trents better but is he worth one million more jitterbug is trent deard worth using a transfer on when city can clean to save their lives and then sammy also thoughts on selling trent obvious cash cow when looking add a premium midfield and pool have tough run in the next few weeks with their champions league games blah i think i know what youre going to say but what do you think about that i want to add a third liverpool defender i want to get kate for my leis spot honestly like i do i just do look one negative for robbo and trent this weekend were they just played fullback they were not playing they were not playing attack attacking positions at all robo had maybe like a small diance in the second half towards the end of the game where he was getting forward a couple of overlapping but he was also getting rinsed which is he was he was all hands on deck trying to defend and he had help and all that but but i just still just going back to what were were talking about earlier is like they played chelsea who is fourth best team in the league top four or other than liverpool a top three attack in the league and they held them to nothing one chance so i so i look at like look yes theyre playing arsenal in a game that i think could just be non a noname and the just the amount of control that hes trying to influence on the games i just like this team i dont care about the fixtures i just feel like i want as many defenders as i can get on this team and i like it so so my near term is like i want to make lewis kate and i want to hold robo as little attacking threat as he has like making that transfer to white or cba just feels like a waste of time because i voice of free theyre very similar and trens still taking tren rob was still taking they had no corners this game somehow i dont know that was a very weird thing theyve been getting very few corners on the seas i feel like its like a directive they dont go to the bine they dont p crosses they do the opposite savio and do they just recycle they dont they dont even try to get the corner i wonder if thats also because its like they think theyre gonna theyre more likely to concede off a corner than score on a corner i could see that but liverpool defense i just im so hard on that like i just feel like thats like the biggest like thats like to me like my biggest edge play is just like i want liverpool defense as much as possible im very there to me trent is just still the best aventer in the game even with this insane run im still just like man that chelsea game was everything for me cuz we had not played a single good team in europe or the league and then to do that i was just like like i believe now and like sammy mentioned in his thing they have arsenal this week they have city and 13 they have a bunch of tough ones in between but like home brighton home villa at southampton like those are all those are just control the game shut them down type of games so y im with you im with you there all right lets go to some questions and how i feel about a triple up on a defense hello that just means its f field baby like f fields back yes sir yes sir thank you sir and then your mood 100 depend 100 depends on if that team cleans or doesnt clean so f thats fun its chill its its good vibes its good vibes lauren said interesting one he said what are your thoughts on a free hit game week nine for teams like mine who dont have holland or palmer like alons free hit 2 plan that never was we know chips are less valuable this season i have three arsenal and two liverpool playing each other as well interesting right i its not insane to me palmer is not part of the equation for me i do think that like newcastle play up to their opponent they played so wellan city joe linton bruno tanali are gonna be up palmers ass all game like whatever its like i think the with palmer similar to all the other premiums like a return is what you should expect but is it a cr like a cricket score like is that something that can happen and if the answer is no then youre fine to not have that player right exactly but looking at dodging arsenal versus liverpool and liverpool versus arsenal and like getting on jumping on a bunch of city not having holland this week feels scary even if with all the negative we just said about holland rammers could just give him a hattrick bednerick and just southampton players will create the chances for holland it doesnt matter like theyre we know what russell martin rusty russell martins going to do and hes going to all out attack and try and possess and be the better team and its going to be a joke i dont love it i but i also dont hate it you hate it i think i hate it i think that youre going to be better placed to use it later when there are blanks like even if its not these expens used to i dont know i just it just it just feels a little short i think the other thing too is hes talking about like my liverpool and its gonna be a nil right right like hes not talking defenders hes not talking about which players he has or how many frees he has its g to be a stodgy affair so if you have like kai mo and saka problem maybe we can talk about it a little bit more but like thats where you just use your freeze there you dont want you dont want soccer with rsl players anyway they have like bad so big daddy said what do you guys see with garnacho very happy to asked this question because okay you go on i missed this game so ive been i watched this ive been very high on garnacho i in higher than most united fs i think honestly for like over a year now he under the radar liam pointed out to me has just started and played 90 for four straight games which was like the only question mark for him i was like is if hes starting hes a incredible pick he takes 50 shots a game hes an absolute genius little demon hes taken the leap last season hes a star i want him in my team immediately they have great fixtures except for chelsea and 10 hes cheap way underpriced and great i think everyone should get him thats about that all right over bj bj man maybe both but garnacho first make sure in order of youre clicking the buttons you bring in garnacho first if youre bringing six2 62 i just i just dont know where you fit him in like who are you forsaking for him rogers seeno hes better than both of them a lot better seeno a lot better what cena is good he doesnt take eight shots he doesnt take eight shots a game not yet and hes at villa home city i dont know mishka do you believe in regression to the mean or is that an fpl fallacy is holland destined to triple return next and spurs will lose to palet with an a brace and a pen talk to me about regressing to the mean well talk to me about the concept of believing in it or not like its a religion well isnt it just a statistical its just how statistics work i think the confusing part maybe for mish is what it means which is like me too can you teach me well because i think we always joke right like vv do like blahs blanked three in a row theyre due to score thats not how it works if holland were to blank 10 gamings in a row we would not expect him to score hes going to score six in one of these games to balance it out what it means is that hell go back to their normal average rate of scoring aka the mean and therefore it will like a curve back to over time it will curve back to where we expected them to be in the first place it doesnt mean theyre just going to make up for everything he holland blank three in a row hes scoring seven this week at southampton so that it averages out to like he shouldnt have blanked three in a row thats not what it means but thats what it means its just like you should expect them to do put their mean performances whether theyre hot you should expect mean performance whether theyre cold you should expect a mean performance over time thats all it means cool hardly boys so i just put up a week where i had zero returns as in not even a midfield or clean sheet point i should just quit right not even a midfielder clean couldnt find a four pointer any forward clean banks that was nice when wood bank the clean today i like those like those shots i can skip some of these cutler do you want to discuss everton defense if we have piw should we be doubling up are we in the middle of their run of queens that gets them out of trouble they were never in trouble never in trouble theyre great i dont know what to say great team for cleans good run of fixures get them out game week 15 they have wow gw 15 ive never seen anything like this they play the four best teams in the league in a row home liverpool home chelsea at man city what well thats great love it but theyre great i dont know what to say doesnt matter if you have pi dont have pickford you should get a defender speaking of defenders x50 said brenford havent kept a clean all season but theyve have a good run coming up and pinck and are donging their lives away is there a defender pick here or are there other cheap defenders you like more so bad theyre just bad like theyre a bad team they attack a bit and there but the spacing is just every game is just very schizophrenic so looking at the four five plays i just i just get i im not sure what are you doing with your defense like are people rotating four or five defense fixture plays like i dont think theyre rotating but i do think that a lot of people have like premium and then 145 theyre just like starting every week for 10 gamings like that i just think thats misguided like to me its like i want to have three defenders that are on good teams like i just i feel like thats the a better way to play this year just more predictable city being a good team is very subjective but but i just feel like youre just going to go a lot farther by spending an extra 0 five or million on that spot not having to worry about collins or newcastle like rotation and then someone gets hurt you have to spend another transfer there its its just a mess like i think you just get three start every weeks is where im at this year one little study that someone should do not me is like what percentage of a defender points come from cleans versus attacking returns versus bonus points and integr because its probably a very high percent very high percent prob like 85 so the idea of getting a defender who you dont expect cleans from despite a good run is just ridiculous they need to be ivanovic like eight goal marcus a eight goals six assist levels to even consider them and if youre looking at like maybe pinck will get me a goal in the next eight game weeks while they keep maybe like one clean its like thats nowhere near good enough its not even in the vicinity of good enough you need cleans thats my on that you need cleans you need cleans last question was giannis he said for non holland owners which captain is best bumo palmer or rogue foden boo its got to be bumo its gotta be bo i think palmers fine cap theres not going to be any leaks because theres a friday game so you cant go fod you just cant do that to yourself think palmers fine but i would go boomo like it like the shout like it like it like it okay cool dude were back f feels back anything else you want to talk about well villa we didnt talk about for one second i you watch this game i watch highlights it was a very strange game very open game its its it just makes me so confused about oli of like what to do with him i know asset unreal header the header was unreal and he had another chance or two that he didnt finish an open play had a oneonone but like they play midweek and its hard to know what eon like he subbed him early because he wants to not he played 75 whatever he wants to play him in europe but they have barmouth at home on the weekend and its going to be their third game of the week and they have spurs liverpool palace chelsea like i dont i know you just got r and im sure a lot of it was because of the run and you didnt think that looked good for him but what do you what do you see with oly im just its hard when a manager gives us different things all the time when like hes said one week hes like were not even going to attempt to attack man utd were just going to sit on a nil and im very happy with that and then next week against fulham hes like i want to play a transitional up and down open space game the whole game and like ali could have triple returned and so getting those like inconsistent data points is hard for me i think to navigate but that said spurs liverpool chelsea coming up like im pretty sure i know how hes going to play those and theyre all away like hes hes playing for a nil in those and allis going to start all of them and allis still great and alli might be on pens but i just think for n million youre not getting like the bang for your buck there at least in the short term like i would just rather that be son and then palmer or just palmer straight up or but its certainly not a problem short end the stick certainly not a problem they could they could score three against bournemouth no problem happens all the time the home bournemouth is the one thats like thats where i was like okay i want to just try and see if i can hold on here its just a good picture for a good team but thats other thing too where im like well bournemouth get to just train and chill all week and they have to play midweek and then play again its like after they already played internationals im just like my god like you they are they gna come out and just get flat look flat and get battered by a more fys team im concerned about you see what pow just did to jim im like good luck against seeno like thats a problem for them i think hes a good start this week but i think like next five i would just rather spend that money elsewhere and hes another one that falls in the same boat of like maybe hes 14 you just bring him straight back home breon what do you see about with rogers like are you happy to hold to play him in some of these tougher games because hes so cheap or no not happy you just you just want to bench him im not happy with that bench or transfer venture transfer thats thats what i think about him and like i listen i know hes a very fit young strapping young lad but hes not playing 90 in europe and 90 in the league all season no well hes also not possible hes also looked i know hes returned recently but hes looked bad like he looked better in the games he wasnt returning the beginning of the year than he has in like the first four game weeks i think he looked a lot better than he has in the last four game weeks he had he had no returns in the first four he has a lot of returns in the last four so hes not playing 5000 minutes and if he tries like the turn and dribble and take on three men against spurs in game week 10 like hes going to get like theyre just gna press the out of him and win the ball nonstop and same with liverpool and same with chelsea im not saying hell complete zero dribbles like that but its just not he needs a rest and like i dont think those games cater to his skills thats fair thats fair villa tough one so many good picks great its a great fpl season its a great f season no it is it is it is and it make its made better by towers well if they can just its its nice to know they can take away goals or assists at any point while they can do whatever they want they can adjust bonus points tomorrow i dont know if its on i tweeted at them before we poed i said are bonus points confirmed yet or goals and assists no response no response which to me means no theyre not confirmed yet so well see how it goes let me slap some
