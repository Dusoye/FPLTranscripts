hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel with me tom camell for another elite 11 team reveal video weve got mark back on the channel hes continuing his excellent start to the season as per usual and this week were also looking at the gw stats from game weeks 1 through four as well as looking ahead to game week 5 to see how mark is thinking of setting up his team moving into gw five so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel for another game week preview and mark welcome back man hows your season been going can see upward trajectory as normal things going well hey tom how are you things are going good this is a season start like ive never had before three green arrows in a row unprecedented id say okay and lets lets see how long we can keep doing it definitely well definitely were going to say that these videos are report to green arrows then lets lets get that in the marketing slogan im intrigued dont mark so this is a this is a great start for you as looking historically as well then i would have thought this is just par for the course so being around about 120k after four game weeks this is what we saying this is one of the best that youve had be bit unusual for me to be honest i think i mentioned on the previous video that like my season trajectory seem to be pretty similar game week one always seems to be good maybe game week two is good and i usually start trailing backwards and then i hold on for as long as i can to play the wild card so im having slightly different thoughts this season im thinking that theres a good wild card week coming up maybe and if i can if i can get to game week six and then it be in a good rank maybe to wild card from a good position would be unusual for me i usually seem to wait till i get in trouble and then use it but maybe if i can be a little bit more proactive this time i can i can preserve the rank and not just fright her at well well see how that plays out and when we had andrew on last week he was anticipating managers a glut of managers using the wild card in gw six so that seems to make sense got a wasu mark around about 120k as i say right now whats the season aspiration looking like right now has it changed because of this strong start or is it pretty much the same as it was at the beginning of the campaign no i dont think it matters too much to be at 120000 at this stage to be honest i think if youre 500 600000 now i think youve more or less got a still got a great chance of a top 10000 and its very easy for me to mess this up from here its its its a small fraction of the season gone i dont think its a time to be getting too excited or anything like that so id be delighted to get top 10th out for a while so thats going to be that remains the ambition that remains the ambition and that is going to be what youre going to achieve and were going to watch it happen over the course of this season mate im looking forward to seeing how it plays out mark were not going to look back on game week four points today were going to look straight ahead to game week five and do your team reveal in a moment but just in terms of how game week four played out was there anything that left out to you as a massive concern ahead of gw five or were you pretty happy to roll your way through and just and just see how things lay as we move into game week five after these carabal cup games and champions league games play out is your team looking strong it was a mixed week in terms of what it meant for my squad moving forward so for example i was fully sure that viol would start on saturday and he didnt he got half the game and so thats a concern im not sure whether the substitution was just preplanned for halftime and it was guardiolas way of managing minutes for two players we always assumed that manager is going to start and rest st start players or give them 20 minutes at the end of the game and thats their rest but maybe guardiola thinks ill just give two players 45 so i think vial is on his way out pretty soon okay har bellis i was thinking that he would lose his place because he came off early in week three but then stevens got a red card so hes back hes got a stay of execution but like hes still rubbish and you further up the pitch and getting concerned about j even though hes playing tonight and liverpool are winning him im not feeling good about him no i understand that man all right cool well in that case lets look forward rather than rather than looking back all of those ones make sense lets take a look at how youre thinking of setting up ahead of gw five okay so were going to do this piece m mark and just reveal these through the different position so in goal youve youve youve opted to stay for ry i was going to say a tough fixture probably the toughest fixture in the league away at man city you got to be so pleased with reys start to the season and that route into the arsenal defense looks like the pick of all goalkeepers right mark hes hes easily my player of the season given the amount of points he scored and like his ownership is pretty low hes looking like a season keeper for me at the moment i dont not pun intended but i dont see how i change him its can i can i can i ask much just on him do you think hes the best route to the arsenal defense or do you still would you prefer to have a an outfield player maybe as a compliment to him or instead of or is rea just with 55 or maybe up depending on when you guys are watching this video is he just the best route into that mle arsal defense i think he is first of all hes a little bit cheaper than everyone else secondly hes nailed white is a little bit too expensive ca i think cba is a good pick but theres a lot of alternatives in defense when there arent alternatives in goal as we can see gabrielle is going to be popular this week but i was just thinking about it today and i remember last season he got rested at home to sheffield united and it was a proper rest and game week six hes got leester at home and if cala fiori was coming near fitness maybe thats a good day to give him a first outing i dont know what the status of his fitness is and timber looks great but i dont know how much he can play so i think to go back to your question for me riy being my wild card and im happy to spend the extra million over lexa henderson and so on r rya got more on sunday than hendersons got all season good point been a been a bit consistent nice pickups hasnt there over the first few game weeks so looks like a great pick on wild card or not like that of course looking forward into the defense then mark youve got pedro porro there despite the mockery being made of poa kog right now and spurs his returns in the league he remains an fbi pick thats of interest i want to get your thoughts around him youve just mentioned howood bis as well so you can talk around the his prospects in the home game against ip switch and him being preferred over gardiel and of course trent alexander are old a lots of money on him as well so talk to me around your thoughts around this back three mark is anyone giving you concern or are you pretty happy with how the defense is set up right now no im not too happy with my defense overall i think its fine for this week i probably will end up with varal in the team especially given how arsal approach to london derby i dont think theyre going to be too ambitious against city har would meis is in there hes just scored tonight its tuesday night the league cup is on and hes scored from a charity taylor assist of all people but southampton are so bad that id probably swap v all back in but its a nice option to have it makes me not too worri if one of the three main guys doesnt line out at least i got har bellis there to come in and possibly score a goal or two even i wont r it youve mentioned southampton being pretty wretched a couple of times already march you think they were getting into already targeting them if youve got players playing southampton offensive players primarily scoring lots of goals against them or them not scoring or a bit of both are we already into that territory after four game weeks well hes not in my squad now but i had a i had brian boomer for week three and i brought him in for one week just to target southampton because theyre wretched the two goals that he scored were mistakes from southampton defense gosh gifts i think you are tire getting southampton and maybe well get around to later on but some of my plans this week could involve maybe getting an ip switch forward okay interesting just not based on the ip switch forward per se but more based on the southampton defense being as bad as it looks like it is its its a case where theyre trying to do something maybe theyre not capable of doing in this league agree theyre playing out from the back and they remain resolute about doing so dont they the manager been insistent about that its not the wisest its you mentioned past the kogu getting mocked a bit like whether thats justifiable or not one thing about him is he doesnt seem too adaptable in his approach and maybe russell martin is similar thats good point so soos dogmatism etc mark pedro parro not the cheapest of fpl options you still comfortable holding him or is he is he going to be maybe not so the question for gw five but longer term what are his prospects in the mark mansfield team i think his prospects are good hes very hes in a very unusual position on the pitch no other fullbacks go where he goes hes he plays a lot of the time as an a he gets into the box late so hes just one of these guys you can play him anytime you dont know whats going to happen and just theres just theres not a lot of standout defenders is there so if you want to hold five and a half million in a position like that in your defense i think hes as good as it gets okay so im happy to keep him im happy to play him any week i played him last week and im happy to have him against brenford this week at home makes sense he can do something course he can and trent alexander arnold a lot of money being invested there in the surprising home defeat against nottingham forest which will have pissed off i think a lot of lot of owners in fpl what do we make of liverpool now they started the three consecutive wins they now had this upset now we worried is that just a blip whats your read on liverpool mark and maybe if i do the team reveal the midfield reveal now this might allow you to give some additional context as well like in terms of a read on them the first game against ips which i dont think you learned too much the second game against brenford is a good win but brenford dont play a low block away we saw him saturday they went out against city and then united just didnt do some pretty basic things well as we all know so the first time that theyve come up against the competent low block that doesnt give them a lot of space in behind they fell over that hurdle so i think the jury is out in terms of their defense because i dont think we can now say theyre a good defense just because they kept those three clean sheets and i think the jurys out in terms of their attack just because maybe there was a little bit of creativity missing on saturday someone to unlock something salah didnt play well hes ive had an eye on the milan game here hes hes quite involved hes hit the crossbar twice hes had a shot so hes looking a little bit sharper today but hes been given space i dont think bournemouth will be as tight as forest work no so like the jur is out i dont know i dont know a lot about slot but im not convinced yet that theyre as good as there was a bit of a soft soaping going on for the first three weeks from the media and so on so its one of the things that makes you hesitant about wild card too early not sure what liverpool are yet no js playing up front bit uneasy about having him on saturday i hope we get a leak because he does something i think that other players in the liverpool team cant do so maybe hell hold his place for that reason but hes missed a few chances hes missed one tonight im a bit worried about his starting place on saturday and then hell be out and the if i play a again wild c game week six hell be out makes sense and the jotter observations youre making there are not new news in terms of him as an fbl option are they i think if you assure him minutes he becomes a an even more favorable option but weve never had that assurance have we interesting observations on liverpool there mark if we look across the rest of the midfield i want to start with rogers there ive seen f see football fix put out some social media posts around the stats that hes aced through game one game weeks one through four having watched the game on sat on the weekend as well are we just inevitably going to pick up points from this geizer at some point like whats going on mark tell assure me its safe to keep him and its all going to be fine i think its its safe to keep him at five million like what are you expecting here from a guy that costs half a million more than a 45m midfielder expecting more but thats probably just complete arrogance from me hoping he passes the he does do theres no doubt about that he is a good footballer and i just if he keeps his place the returns will come so hes not hes not on the cho and block but i do have a strong front dat so i can ive been putting him in and out of the team i think i left him out in week one and hes played every other week but like theres a bit of a team here im im doing quite well but im still feeling a bit short changed on trent h jada and rogers returns and then eie missing the penalty not taking the penalty at the weekend like things could be going better here and i know everyone can say this about the team no youre right but i feel like salahs maximized his returns im not sure he deserve well deserved is a bad word he got them but like i think his points against united came very easy whereas trent should have a lot more points i think ch should have more and roger certainly should have more and as i right as well go ruled out harshly as well and gosh he played well in the open games didnt he i didnt have him then so i pretty pleased with that i thought it was interesting glasner came out at the weekend and said after the event he said weve got two penalty takers which is what you would say if youre trying to ameliorate a situation that had a raisen like what else is he going to say no kidding it didnt it didnt look a particularly of acrimonious situation did it there on the week can but he was just bullied off it he was well see whether or not that happens in the next next game okay cool and in terms of smith row there as well another budget option there mark someone who your expectations are tempered slightly as a consequence of that and still pretty happy with him hes been hes not getting much fanfare is he no hes hes got 22 points everyones been talking about rogers m seeno sms done well but im not sure why smi hasnt got any of these big bandwagons because hes hes done well hes got a 10p pointer hes got a seven pointer so im happy to have him but i will probably tell him but im happy i got him at the start absolutely so you should be and then looking forward into this front line and mark of harland the absent xiao pedro in gw four look at that with the arm band as well and isak hooked at hal time suddenly missing majority the of the game on the weekend disappointing a lot of owners lets talk through this front three mark whats your whats your read on the forward situations in fpl right now well i think harlands good thank you thank you for that the big bucks isac is like its just been quite unlucky with isac i think it could be a whole different story if sh didnt get sent off in week one and then he gets the ball in the head and he goes off ive always had ive had a feeling for years now that isak is just a bit soft i wasnt surprised he went off i didnt think he was going to soldier on no but i have got like i have got hit in the head with the ball before and got concussed i remember one time the grass turned blue okay so i can sympathize with him to a degree but i do think hes a bit soft for going off there and then joe pedros got the captains armband and that points towards my problem this week and its a problem where i think theres a very obvious solution and its a sal captaincy okay so i dont have a captain and thats why its joe pedro at the moment well just before we talk around transfer plans and the moal suggestion there the xia pedro captaincy though i was going to quiz you on there because im pretty impressed by forest defensively i thought they ended the season well defensively and theyve started this season well defensively as were seen in the stats sl next as well in terms of for forest as an as an option defensively do you think were sleeping on them as a budget friendly team as well mark ive not seen much personnel in anyones team in terms of forest as well youve youve caught my cabbage there because i was going to comment on that later on forest were third in the expected calls against statistic after three games which okay whatever small sample size and you think okay theyre third now theyre going to anfield where will they be afterwards theyre still third so theyre could be people i think are going to this weekend with welbeck and pedro im not sure id fancy it and like this is i dont think i can captain pedro at home to forest because of his minutes out and because forest are good so its a question i have to answer who else do you captain there you can always captain howland umh if hes a doubt i think j is a starting doubt rogers maybe like im running out of options here for captaincy i dont have a good one i dont think harlands always a good captain choice mark right as you to astutely observed hes hes not a bad player as he so he is good youre youre right about that hes good all right lets lets lets talk around these so youve got two free transfers mark no prospect of wild carding into game week five here but what are your transfer plans then mate what are you looking at how are you going to accommodate mo sal in this team whats the whats the plan im going to do i think what everyone else did last week and ship saaka and isak most likely to get salah and it cheap forward and all the great alternative thinkers of fpl have alternatively came up with the same idea and thats jamie vy ive made a a short list of people who could come in ive got i think 58 to spend there and its a its a pretty grim watch list mur row its got danny welbeck i dont want to get him for the reasons i mentioned its got vy hes hes old but he scored a jamie vardy goal at the weekend so like hes all right theres strand larson he looks all right but its villa so no r jimnez hes not playing tonight i hes my second favorite right now hes just he gets sneaky points he does well put lets talk about vardy quickly we spent some considerable time slagging off southampton earlier on in the video so just wonder whether or not is there a ip swi are they a attacking option here as well mark do you think is that a prospect that youre enamored with the final name on my list is the lap the lap went off early last week and his his numbers dont add up no i think we all remember he banged one in against fulham and it was spectacular and thats going to stick in peoples minds but his numbers just dont add up in relation to to what vity can do i think no far enough vs getting the minutes as well surprisingly probably for most people i love its 2024 and one of our managers is talking about bringing in jamie vardy into their fbi team its its going to be the bandwagon this week believe it or not no kidding definitely well well see that itll be a party being had all over the place all right thats cool now we mentioned it earlier on guys in the video that were going to start looking at statistics on a rolling basis on these videos so lets take a look at game weeks one through four stats and how theyre playing out so far okay guys so what weve got here weve just pulled out six key metrics and the idea here is that these will be rolling four week averages were only in game week five so happily weve only had four game weeks worth of data thus far and weve included a little caveat there or filter restriction to make sure that we exclude players whove not yet played 180 minutes so danny yings unluckily will not feature on this video beyond that mention that ive just made of him so mark lets start with the team metric there the expected goals conceded in the b right hand corner there you me mentioned forest there do we like fulham as well potentially as a defensive avenue for budget friendly options or are we saying that its down to liverpool spurs and man city and youre going to have to spend big money if you want to get those mle defenses and i arsenal will inevitably end up in there in due course to whats your read on the on the defensive look in fpl so far i havent talked about it too deeply yet for the wild card on fulham i think its a mixed one for robinson hors because theyve had two late concessions but theyve also got two assists which are a bit unpredictable i think the pick there might be anderson at 44 okay and hes hes going to improve the fulham defense im not surprised hes come out of the palace defense and its got worse good point at forest i think well all be talking about alex marine if he keeps starting and i also think is fine so for forgive the ignorance is moreno though the boy who plays left back for forest so he was the one who did such a good number on salah on the weekend hes the guy who was at villa until recently i i was watching the liverpool game was on in ireland so i was watching that on saturday and i didnt have salah so like i was like my god i shouldnt be watching this and i saw it was moreno and i this is going to be horrendous and marena did well he did do well he did he did liverpool had an off day but still you have to you have to play well to get that win so if ana and mareno are getting their starts i think ill probably get one on the wild card for sure and then i think trent will stay in for everyone im happy with parro maybe the wise play is to get two arsenal defensive assets roya and someone else starting to look that way isnt it maybe not for gw five you no not for gw five but like what surprises me on the arsenal defense is like if you forget the summer we all decided about seven eight weeks ago that we all had to have two arsenal defensive assets because they were clearly the best defense and then roll on to game week one and people have one or no defenders i find that very hard to rationalize how people dont have arsenal defense and i think its going to change everyones going to have hs or a second arsenal defender soon very soon interesting and maybe itll just take getting through that etad fixture before that starts to manifest inpl all right mate cool lets take a look then so weve got expected goals attempted assists shot shots in the box and expected fpl points only four game weeks already mark but is anyone standing out here that we havent talked around yet that you want to devote some time to olle watkins would be a name that we havent spent any time on he returned well in gw four what do you think about him as an option bearing in mind the duran situation there as well whats your read on olle watkins i theres been doubts about him that maybe hes not been fit at the start of the season but not withstanding that hes played limited minutes and hes got big chances in all the games like he could be a long way where ahead of where he is now in terms a point if he was just doing some fairly fundamental finishing correctly mhm i think corey from the elite 11 has had him since the start and i reckon he feels hes been a bit unlucky with that if i had a set i could sell howland for watkins this week and maybe upgrade some maybe upgrade j the salah something like that and ill consider it late into the week if i dont have if i dont get forced to move early on prices ill definitely continue to consider taking howland out for watkins wow he has hes come off injured tonight well no he hasnt come off injured hes come off and got bandaged hes got a nice pack on his ankle and going back to your question where you mentioned duran i think just to keep the piece emory has to give jan a start like he just cant keep saying to this guy youre not starting it just doesnt work in a team environment hes got to give him a start soon and you think that will come in game five potentially bearing in mind that they played their champions league game one 30 didnt they this evening but as you mentioned watkins came off after an hour didnt he so i think that could that could disappoint new i think if watkins isnt 100 i think if hes not 100 theres no reason not to play jant fair enough so i think watkins has done well i think hes a good pick its if you have the funds to do it and as people are saying repeatedly like the good thing here is the pricing is difficult this season right makes the game better doesnt it definitely no this has been a very varied season i think we see a lot of variation and its good okay the name i also wanted to get your thoughts on here we got no hes not in your team up but lou diaz was flavor of the month for a little bit there wasnt he and then disappointing game against forest there is he in the same diego jot type camp and could be a good pick therell always be question mark s over minutes and returns as a consequence of that and its its a hold if you have him but not a buy if you dont i think it like it depends on going forward from here i think it depends on how you like to spend your 145 on a saturday if you worry about team sheets then maybe j and diaz arting for you hell have good days he and hell have hell have bad days same with j and if you worry about not getting starts you should stay away from the two of them i think weve weve become conditioned to expect the rotation in the liverpool front line but we dont know how slot thinks about this he doesnt when managers are in the job a long time theyve got a bit more confidence to rotate they know things a bit better slots under pressure now so is he going to start chancing players that he doesnt think are the best to be in the team like is he just going to put in darwin or gakpo just because theyre there im not so sure especially if he comes under a little bit of pressure agree final question for me mate you mentioned him briefly seeno earlier as a budget friendly option there in terms of rogers smith row and seenu you got an opinion as to which one is represents the best value for money right now if you were to wild card would one or more of those guys be in the team what do you think of the budget enabling midfield options there and the issue the issue with s menu is his fixtures so hes got liverpool now got two nice ones but then he has arsenal villa city and i couldnt be having that its its its too tough someone there who and i was nobody was looking at until the weekend was is mcneil see him there attempted assist poking out and their fixtures are fantastic coming up but again hes not one of my types of signings but the 55 bracket is just i think you get someone there ive got smi ro right now but i think you keep that place on a wild card and maybe you get seeno maybe you get minte theyre theyre all good options like and itll be they rob it ag green whether you catch their halls or not at the right time we even snuck thomas such in nice to get a tok to tokenistic west ham mention in all of my videos at some point if i can manage to shoehorn one in theres no danny yings here is there danny yings misses out because of the minutes restriction i was forced to put on by my employers but there you go otherwise im sure hed be in the conversation mark well done mate love lovely start to the season wild card still in hand two free transfers all looking rosy any final thoughts before we wrap things up not just i think im going to last week i feel i took a fair bit of risk not having salah when i look in the leagues around me and the ones i there are a lot of managers where who i rate they all went to salah and i just thought i put it off a week and i feel like i benefited from taking that risk and i think t taking that on again with salah this week is just a step too far and have a chance here to just lower my risk keep a good rank wild cared from a position of power so thats where my head is at right now ive taken my risk ive benefited from it and now its time to maybe just cash in my chip it well were going to see how thats going to play out mate over the next few game weeks will get you on soon it sounds like itll be shortly after youve wild carded if things go to plan but i look forward to seeing how things how things going game week five and beyond mark and another congratulations on a great start to the season thanks for joining us do please smash a like on the video leave a comment down below if youve got any questions for mark im sure we can get back to you in the week and i wish you all the best of luck for game week 5 and ill be back with you all next week take care byebye
