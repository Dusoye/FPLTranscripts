welcome back for another video i hope you all had a good gami 10 if not lets hope for a big gami 11 lets run through how the teams lining up this week and my tr for plans starting off with a quick review of how last game it went first 53 points all out which was enough for a green arrow up to 1 mil if hed offered me a green arrow with a harem blank and a salah goal as a nonowner would have to take that fortunately viio johnson rogers wood and k all chipped in with returns that all said a disaster transfer as it played out it was two shots in three gamings for salanki so he left the team ahead of what had potential to be another tough game against villa and in came kuna it had to be the week sanki finally showed up with two goals and assist so well done if you had him madison was dropped to the bench which did have a clear benefit to spurs and sense of a better shape though he might go back to starting both k and madison this week given its an nip switch fixture seeno goal on the bench though he was never in consideration to start given the midfielders and fours ive have got but im glad to see him on the score shoot and avoid a fifth yellow card so ls of bench from man city and it was walker back in the 11s so hes become even more of a concern now not feeling as confident as minutes moving forward lets get into the team for gamei 11 and transfer plans a quick look at your fpl highs and lows sent in this week fpl hofburger says 29 points on the bench absolute killer you had rogers davies and seeno all on the bench who all scored more bench pain n says its fair to say i did not bench the right players this week we had salanki and ana on the bench you combine for 31 points between them f pilson says deciding to be patient with sank and johnson and also savio the latter not getting minutes allowing johnson to come in finish on a huge 77o game week bambi says seeno bench i sold sanki i brought in r gimenez and i sold rogers and bought gacho finished with 25 points last game week gar captain was pretty bold in fairness but everyone blanked here very unlucky the lowest score in the top 10k last game it was 18 points not a single return here either including zero pointers from martinez and daa one poters from eight nory white lis diaz hav and jackson amaya says not complaining finished on 82 points which was a gw rank with 34k in the world absolute dream game week this must have been an insane green arrow and lastly alice says luck continues very inspiring rank gams here and quite a good reminder of whats possible in a short time if you get it right ranked 15m in gami 5 now 664 in the world after gami 10 just five gemics later keep it up onto the team for make 11 them in goal ive got a rare choice to make between two keepers here fabianski is in the starting 11 currently given hes got the home fixture to everton while arsenal away to chelsea he hasnt exactly impressed in the last couple of starts over arola though so we could see them swap back at any point have any of you got the ryan fabianski combo if so who are you starting you could also make the case with fabianski if your second keeper someone like hanson martinez sanchez or veran my backline this week is vardal gabriel and pedro porro so ive dropped lewis to the bench so if this is a week where lewis doesnt start i need porry to finally deliver as he was bought his insurance against lewis which so far hasnt yielded any benefit whatsoever with returns of 1 two and one this was how man city lined up in the champions league midweek a shocking 41 defeat to amar sporting in his final home game for them lewis started and right back and he did play 90 vardal phon and harland also played 90 spurs topped the clean sheet probabilities this week given a 42 chance man uniter and second liverpool third man city fourth i dont even think vel was immune from pep rette himself but hes a safer pick than lewis overall so ive started him pep might favor walkers pace with his upcoming games brighton spurs and liverpool that all said i wasnt impressed by walker last game mick i feel like he had a bad game against bournemouth despite citys defensive w vels the second top scoring defender with 49 points thats more than johnson bowen son k and havers only por has taken more than his 15 shots in fact so if i can find a way to make it work id like to keep him longterm still though i might need to move some money around in the coming weeks to accommodate sacka potentially salah gabrielle completes the backline though if theres some team needs of a louis start i will be tempted to give him a start instead and chase the maximum upside given ive got palmer otherwise itd be att attacko versus defender rya versus fabianski and lewis versus gabriel feels like one that could be a swingy outcome which i want to get right this week and arsenal clean sheet with gabriel and ry on the bench would be brutal so i could hedge with gabrielle in mid field its seeno palmer and buo and johnson seeno is back in the team in place of rogers whos got liverpool this game week hes taken 42 shots this season at a rate of 42 per game which only harand can beat with 48 hes looking like bourus talis man now after sans departure and im glad i kept hold of him he rotates nicely with rogers and wood as well sanos away to brenford who still yet to give a clean sheet this season 20 goals conceded which is third worst behind wols and ipswitch so as an aumo owner lets hope for a goal fest in this game he did have a quiet game against fulham on the weekend he didnt register a single shot no chances created fulham were all over them to be honest and it is a home fixure this week as braford looked to bounce back with a win so selling salanki was a bit of a disaster and its an amazing effecture this week as well though at least im still sitting on double spurs with por and johnson tottenham are top for expected goals this season with 2013 man city and liverpool second and third its going to be johnsons last week in the team hes going to be leaving one way or another in gamei 12 before theyre away to city so either be for salah or sacka arsenal way down in eight for expected goals here though a few red cards have skewed that a bit and ards been a huge miss the good news is ards back in training so im still very interested in the arsenal tag a parting gift from johnson with one more return would be very welcome this week all in all hes been a successful transfer since coming in for lis diaz with two goals in four can he make it three and five so palmas currently yellow flagged after a poor tackle from martinez last game around his knee my initial thoughts were its just a knock so im expecting him to be fine for game 11 personally chelsea are going to need him here theyre tied on 18 points of arsenal its fourth versus fifth big opportunity here to set three points between them i cant see myself selling him for a long time hes got to be a very longterm h with chelseas fixtures hes a very strong shout for the best captain in game 12 though salah against southampton is also a shout up front its wood kya and harland im going to need a kya brace and a slanky blank to claw back some lost points so i think im going to have to write k off as a bad transfer made slightly too soon with hind so richardon has picked up an injury again as well so salanki is nailed on he might even get 90 minutes this is a mustwin game for wolves theyre bottom of the premier league table one point behind southampton and the win could take them straight out of the relegation zone just 137 projected goals in the not the forest versus newcastle fixture this graphic from 11 to5 k would keep his run of goals going though only harlands got more than his eight goals scored this season and bums also got eight im waiting up whether wood could be a sell after the ip switch fixture when the got city in fact in bumo as well from g 14 when his fix is also turn i think it could be an opportunity to bank the profit on these guys and pivot to some other assets of better fixtures for example i could go and bumo to sacker and gamei four team and theres the likes of welbeck jackson watkins eak all great upcoming fixtures as a possible wood replacement later so that brings me to harand then im not feeling comfortable about captaincy this week m city are out of form in fact theyve just lost three games on the bounce in all competitions for the first time in six years injuries to important players and harland out form with one goal in his last five league games a miss penalty in the champions league as well i very nearly captain palmer last game week but in the end both blanked anyway so no difference there ive only got one free transfer and i just cant bring myself to minus four harland out to salah although that would have worked out last game we it also means selling rogers and benching wood or seeno one of the few positives from the champions league was de brys return he came off the bench and if hes pass fit enough to start the next gameing that be a huge boost to their attack though hes opening five game mi hes certainly lived up to the 1550 mil price tag but when hes scoring one and five for over 15 mil such a huge waste of money and youve got salah and palmer putting up more points for cheaper over the last five game the craziest part is hes top in the league for non penalty expected goal of them with 414 salz is less than half that needs to find his finishing boots peps one of the best in the game at finding solutions to difficult situations can he bounce back this week and more importantly for my team can harlem bounce back on the bench its ry lewis rogers and greaves so ive got 16 mil on the bank got one free transfer i dont think its worth taking the minus four to sell harand for seller but that could be a mistake so the plan as it stands is to roll the transfer so this will take me to two pre transfers taken into the international break and then ill have the option to buy sal for harand for free instead in gamei 12 so to quickly run through gamei 12 pulling up plan fpl these are the two paths im considering the first option in game 12 is harand to eak and johnson to salah isaks home to west time that week have been a ropey defense and hes got great longterm fixtures and he starting to show some form so i quite like that route of isach i would have to delay getting sacka to game 14 though which should probably be in boomo to sacka and inario down to a 46 mil defender like cwell the other option for gami 12 is johnson to sacka and then completely move off man citys defense by going lewis to vardo and dunk to coell now that would be a minus four here but it does get me straight to three premiums quicker however i would be bank on harem match and until gimick 15 which have to make the switch such as harand to isak and aumo to salah im undecided at the moment but fortunately ive got plenty of time to think it over so im not going to do it this week harand wont keep blanking forever things change fast in fpl like if it was the hall against brighton there sudden its tempting to keep him and just add sacka to get to three premiums in gamei 12 and then delay sal till gamei 15 so thats where im currently at thanks for watching hit subscribe for more fpl content
