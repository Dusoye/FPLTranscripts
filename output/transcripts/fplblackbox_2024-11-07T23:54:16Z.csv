good evening everyone welcome to fbo blackbox ahead of gw 11 my name is asz and look at that mark we are bang on time for the first time i dont know god knows bl is so surprised i look at pangy in there my god thats on time its its the new its a new software were using which is a lot slicker means im a bit calmer i didnt throw any headphones this week i had to get a new webcam though because my webcam broke last night you so nearly did a whole week of like no stress and then last night its as my webcam is broken i need to get an order on i dont if its going to arrive in time its so here we go it was it was so tranquil nothing straightforward it anyway thecam minutes before 10 minutes before we start were in were on time beautiful green arrows as well come on go youve closed the gap though havent you massive week for you massive well talk about that in a bit what else are we going to talk about tonight we got we got some stuff on amar we talk about his new tactics what we can expect three amazing fixures for them coming up so well talk a bit about those ive already got one in my side i might be getting another one so well see what tonight brings on that we got to talk about big dom big dom sanki getting his 16o return making a lot of people very happy near making me very sad cuz i do how close i was to selling him have i told you i know i cant believe it you were going to do what you were going to do dom to ry gimenez right i was going to do dom to gimenez and i had it on confirmed transfers and i did a poll i did a poll on twitter which said something like who scores more than x2 salanki or gimenez and i think it was like 65 him anders people said seriously and i looked it and i thought theres lots i could do with that money i want to be moving to palmer in the future salahs a player that i want i can take some money out and go for him and is i would be sick to my stomach if i had done that move so glad i didnt id be id be id be beating you if youd have done that you would be my godar me imagine that i cant believe you were that close to doing it as well i we did talk about it didnt we because we talked about salanki last week and you said you on the verge of giving up on him and i said i said we got to hold him for the h switch game surely and arent we glad we did because now he goes into that game as what i looked at the betting odds that rob t put up and hes like the third favorite scorer this game week and our teams look pretty good with salanki in there so commiserations to anyone who mov this week is he you going to cat on him right spoiler early spoiler know i know come from g from selling him to captain its a funny old game and if you look at the fixures hes had brighton west ham i switch to come the game that i didnt hold out much h for was this was this villa game and it seemed like the logical one to sell him on but you called it last time you said villa have looked a bit a bit ropey struggling a bit with the champions league the underlying stats in defense were good but starting to tire a bit and i thought spurs were brilliant in that match and rightfully blew them away so it should be a big youve got three spurs assets going into whips swit i know i me its funny isnt it because last week when i got porro and johnson in it looked like ive made a fa parkers they went to paris and they were miserable i didnt expect the returns i didnt expect big returns in the paris game but i thought i might get something but it was always with the vi the home games in mind the three home games that they got in four and but i wasnt expecting the big returns in the villa game so itd be just like it would be spursy wouldnt it if they like drew one and lip swis s got the goal surely not we have got over 400 joining us already and theres european football going on and chelsea what they what six seven8 nil up by now i dont know they were 6 n up after 42 minutes against the armenian minnows that they were playing six nil at halim exactly no cole palmer in that game of course we will all touch on cole palmer but just to give a shout out to those in the chat tonight thank you for joining us thats paul signs thats henn fbl forest you sexy beast nicholas kill tristan cox tony g mr lucian emu show connor richardson i am 1974 at a boy fbo yellow army good evening davis family first tony g j keeg theyre all in tanky no sign of nigel yet im sure hes there in the background just hasnt commented yet thank you for joining us on a thursday night 900 well be going up to probably 11 knowing us maybe a little bit more if theres any super chats in there we will get to them of course of course lets get on with this by hitting your game week mr as your first 53 points talk us through it god youre getting into this like streamer hosting lck you reading names hitting my team i cant wait till the smash and like ill do a bit of that in a minute off to go t is all right week 53 points ryer and trent the two premium defenders who a lot of people have got disappointing each and every week with three and two with the one moreno finally making past the halfway line was nice to see and ana on the on the other side its nice to see the fullbacks finally doing a bit of bit of attacking it was morenos best display from an attacking point of view had an amazing display against salah anfield but going forward last weekend he was just very confident taking players on it was great to see it looks like hes like enjoying being in the side isnt he like you see his celebrations after the games and hes like acting for the players and there real quality like there and i think with ana as well on the other side theyre theres no reason why they should be shackled because they can offer a lot going forward so i think moreno at 44 is a good purchase i think if you offer me the switch to ana id probably take it hes a little bit more but im pretty happy with mor how minkovich didnt score though no well talk about him later right he had one past the post and then the brilliant sa by fabianski for the one that anderson play back to him its coming for him for sure the issue with my defense though was i bought in leaf davis to play him in two games what you thinking here tell talk me through the logic of that you b you have leave davis surely you have to play him in the home games well the logic was im not im going to play trent on i trents going to play im g to play moreno at home to west ham so there was one spot and it was between ls gabrielle and davis but did you think that city would keep a clean sheet at bournemouth i two clean sheets at all season i didnt think any three of them would and the issue was i just thought it was i just thought it was a loss it was probably which one has probably the best chance of the clean sheet in these three and i thought it probably see but when youre talking about leaf davis its got to be whos the best one for attacking returns is it if you didnt think take clean sheets out of it whos more likely to get you an attack in return leaf davis or l okay if you if you if you if you can tell me that you were expecting leaf davis to score a left footed volley from the corner of theen area into the into the corner it happened what they all concede it thats what i thought would happen and i think it was its just a lottery isnt it lewis could have scored a goal if hed started from outside the penalty era gabrielle could have headed one in from a set piece i dont know it was it was a mistake is top for chances created of all defenders but they havent got any strikers that can score ill give you that i dont know it was it was probably it was probably the wrong move i it was the wrong move give the points and i wish i had played him because i i bought i had him for the these two games i had him for everon at home and lester they were the two games i was going to play him in and i went against that thing but so thats nine points lost which does hurt but anyway played rogers though played rogers played rogers i was i was happy with that with his with his nine foden again i dont know how he blanked in that match hes hes now the second highest for xg involvement over the last two game weeks just behind harland who also planked again inuma garach how did garo not get a return against chelsea because hes very wasteful thats why i know but my god he had two great chances in that game harand blanked i dont know how he blanked in that watkins had a great oneonone opportunity against spurs and put it wide and luckily i was bailed out by sanki cuz without him with salah scoring and other things going on it wouldnt have been a very good week so it was it was a funny week it was a week where i think it could have been better if i played davis foden got something gach got something ifs woods and buts but green arrow fen had that chance second half that he put wide it was a good shot that and hes he scored in midweek of course so its coming for foden theres no doubt its just how long you hold him against the options out hes got one more week one more week for me heroic doses says as if it makes you feel better i did play davis but i bench salanki bench salanki i dont think that makes me feel better makes me feel a bit makes me feel a bit sick mr or mrs doses what did you have up front that meant you bench salanki i want to know we all want to know put that in chat ill look out for it lets bring my team up shelby because its a green arrow its a big one 75 do we have to fleen fleen were talk we talk about him shall we that was absolutely painful some fbl gold between us though wasnt it because when he when the clean sheet went in you said to me when do you think hell break your heart and it was inevitable i was like well it always what always happens is you wait until they got maximum bonus and thats when they concede you wait until they hit peak points and he got maximum bonus and then he started getting more saves and he was on for 12 conceded one only fell to eight and i was like what ill take the eight three bonus with the 10 say perfect and i thought to myself the only way hes going to lose the free bonus now is if he lets another one in and this is with what 30 seconds to go and they played another minute of stoppage time and he let the second one in it was funny watching because obiously youve got him i havent and i went for ray im paying more and its been painful owning ry over the last few and i was i joked you i sent you the message and said how long till fleen loses it and as the game started going on i started getting more and more nervous that it wasnt going to happen and he was just going to go on and get this absolutely mammoth hall and i dont know when they scored it was funny cuz because youd said to me whens he going to the pet and then you were watching the stream but youre a little bit ahead of me and so then i just got the message from you saying yep hes absolutely sh and then as i read it i saw him concede and i was like believable it was i was prepared for it so it wasnt as devastating as perhaps it would be for others and id had a good game we so i could take it if i had a bad way game week i think id have had to say to pip i just go out we need some more milk then just gone for a walk for two hours at like 1000 at night just invented a reason to get out the house and be alone there must be people out there who if you didnt have slanking if you didnt have salah maybe even have johnson bench im sure theres going to be people out there who had rogers on the bench sorry not johnson rogers on the bench no salanki no salah and had fleen and saw that hall and saw the green arrow and was like thank god i got a player bringing something home and then sorry if thats you dear me anyway fleen four trent two gabrielle 2 porro one miserable in defense ino 3 and here it comes rogers nine johnson 8 salo 18 seeno chow was the captain of course seeno 10 harland two salanki 16 the fact that i played seeno over lewis raised a few eyebrows and of course raised suspicions of we got a leak i knew people think that the thing is i was on the train to notam i had no signal and i was like try to get a signal to message in whatsapp and say people are going to think this arent they when i just like all the team news was coming in and so on and i was like i was surprised that more people didnt play so many i was surprised how many teams did bench de bench him i was pretty shocked that i was he was such a differential because i always thought city would concede and then like whos most likely get the goal but what was funny one of the reasons i played him and this is i shouldnt be affected by this but i was on on friday night i was waiting for the embargo team news to come through and it came through from pep about ive got a few injuries so that spooked me a bit and i thought well we dont know who those injuries are and he said to like youll find out i was like brilliant thank you so i didnt think lewis would be injured but i thought that perhaps thered be more injuries and then city more likely to concede so i thought ill play some meno if theyre going to be weakened but the other thing that made me play him was there was a interview with him on bbc on the bbc website which i presume was on football focus and on it he talked about setting a goal target and when its just recency biased i watched it and thought hes a good player and he he could get fit and i was i was talking myself into playing him and thats that was played into it as well and its just weird out those little things like if you read an article or someone there someone just brings a player to mind you could be on twitter could you just bre through twitter and that could be the thing that just makes you go when its so close and it was like the difference between seeno rogers lewis when i looked and gabrielle when i looked at review because i was looking at review and they were all about between 3 four 37 expected points but when its like that its like well its down to me theres not theres not enough in it where the algor the model going to help so i just went on my biases which was well i dont trust pep and i think city will city will let one in at least and they let two in so two things on that firstly you could have given me the tip off that lewis was benched that would have been i didnt know he was bench did i of course you didnt you think im that im glad city wasnt the first kickoff because it would have been even worse wouldnt it imagine if we both bench lewis imagine if i had bench lewis for for davis would have got absolutely slated for being in the old cartel i wanted to ask say for example you had to play lewis this week because youve got no ged to say gabrielle was a was a d okay doesnt work with this example but say you were playing lewis this week would that make you less likely to want to play seeno what if i was playing lewis and seeno in the same it would because i hate that i hate so do i so that was the other factor it was like i was always going to play gabrielle over lewis because i felt the goal threat from gabrielle is far greater and i thought that e i thought well maybe arsenal will concede city will concede so its then go threat so its always gabrielle and i was pretty certain he was going to play gabrielle i dont think there was i dont think there was much doubt going into the game week that gabriel was going to start based on what wed heard and what arteta had said not that you can trust arteta but so it was never a choice between gabriel and lou it was always do i go three at the back or four at the back and bench seeno so its or leou thats the nine points that i lost out on my leaf days i just dont dont get why you weve le it was it which not likely to score is what were your think because i played him at home to everton and they lost 30 that was that was honestly that was the fixture right i should have i its not okay were on your team now we dont need to do the whole thing on lea davis but that is going to sting i think for a while that move but when i cant i cant so i just i cant believe pep said one player we cant rest is ric its funny everyone said didnt they in the week that means hes benched for sure i didnt think that i didnt think for one minute lewis wouldnt start it was just most likely get me some points but i was surprised how many played lewis and how many owned some meno i sold a lot of people sold seeno as well he was a mwe for palmer and so i was surprised he was such a differential when i got a signal and i finally flick in through teams i was like blame me s meno could work out and he did which was great so last a bit of luck he is the dominant player for them and its a good time to look at the ticker balmer fixtures now brenford brighton wolves those three in particular very strong from an attacking standpoint theyll probably concede but having seeno for those for that runs pretty good and it doesnt theyre fifth on the ticker here over the next 12 i say who impressed me that was kirz with a two he was cuz i had him i had him last season do you remember when everyone went for zabani and i was like ill take the punt on kirz thatll be fun misses out in the first double game week zabani scores and then they then they concede that was so you talk you talk about theres little things like kirkus i look at him think you let me down that time it wasnt even its not his fault he didnt get picked but i still look at him think that was that was your fault but i think kirk stats are good we going to talk about a bit later but hes another one four 43 is theres some decent options emerging around like the four the four fiveish bracket and the thing is its like no clean sheets but i think youve got to just consider the attack and return potential now theres no clean sheets anywhere no not even arsenal now as were were going to touch on its its now about which defenders are most likely to get you something in the in the attacking third because finding defenders who can get you clean sheet like in fact vardia was now described as the better option over lewis which is crazy because its like its leis is cheaper and so hes the cheaper route into the city defense but because all we care about is attacking returns because weve given up on clean sheets you go bario and its its weird it if like people saying now which city defender theyd say aio even though he cost more because lewis is only getting you clean sheets he might get assists youll probably get one goal maybe two over the season but v is unquestionably the more attacking of those two and now thats all we care about because was it two clean sheets for city and i dont think theyre coming anytime soon brighton spurs liverpool theyre not going to keep a clean sheet in any of them games i dont think no and is a problem with lewis because hes hes 47 48 hes his place is at risk each week i expect him to play most games but he will get the odd he will he will miss the od game when walker comes in he hasnt got as good attacking threat as some of the defenders around his priz and hes not keeping clean sheets as well so its the thing im playing him each week because hes a man city defender im trying to im thinking okay this is statistically one of the best defenders in the league and one of the best teams in the league and its im im losing out to players like leaf davis and eight nory and kirz and lewis hall and stuff who also arent getting clean sheets but have a bit more going forward hes becoming a troll he is like i look at him i probably will have to play him this week because i dont want to play rogers and field but maybe i should because city at brighton again i feel like theyre going to concede lewis probably isnt going to get an attack in return so what am i looking at a one or two point i might as well play rogers and roll the dice maybe but i dont know ill make up my mind later in the week maybe ill read an article about rogers and be convinced by that again but thats what it takes when its so close you just it is in a way you can when youre in my position well go against the eo and go well if the player with lower ownership go with that person but out of lewis and rogers theres not much in it is there so the one cave i would say on the strategy of going with what players are saying about themselves is dont forget nicholas bner who was the most arrogant if you went by purely by that hed be your captain every week because of how well he spoke about himself but the thing is seeno had a sausage dog as well and he was nice in the video and its stupid isnt it because you start thinking what a nice guy and hes got hes got a dog like mine and and then 10 minutes later the pep stuff comes out and then lo and behold im going now im going to start some menu and of course that must have fed into its so weird i dont know but it is it is youve got to be careful what you expose yourself to when youre looking at your fbl lineup because if youre on twitter too much or you read too much or you watch a video the biases come through dont they and you got to be aware of that and it could often go completely wrong the antithesis of harland for you who you dont feel dont speak so highly of i should have just stuck with my guns not gone on twitter and made up my own mind but the fomo was made worse by all the ferar about the hat tricks and everything you read about when i didnt have harland there was all this talk of him getting what 40 goals this year suddenly thats all evaporated no ones got him anymore im looking at everyones team everyone him and everyones talking about chris wood like all the pundits and everything chris woods getting all the attention about like isnt it marvelous how the oldfashioned number nine and suddenly the talk of harland has completely im keeping the fave wai in the good let look at this shows your am and he had sal god my i just realized look at my formatting on that disgraceful the ocd is kicking in ive jsky salers aligned to the right as is mine and your holland im should have corrected that never mind ignore that past cant see it lots of salah captains which surprises me i didnt realize that most of that way and three hars and i because it was harland who make w guess for most of these teams when i checked through teams as i do when deadline passes i look and see what other people have done a lot of people made the harland out to sell a move which paid off in the short term but its a big its a big commitment how do you feel about that now because youre looking at this youre probably one of the few managers along with myself who probably still got him i thought about it i thought about doing harland out for sou harland i think it was harland and as well as the salanki to himz move it was going to be harland and because ive got dibling to salah and himz i think it was i was determined to get himz one way or the other and glad i didnt but i think it i would have i would have about broken even on it because although salah would have come in and got the goals i would have benched rogers who scored so and then with the hit i dont think there was a huge amount in in not doing it i thought about doing it this week again not for himz this time but for kuna but as a spoiler im im not doing that so im going to be going another week without salah in my team but i i expected it to be more split i expected there to be more i know this isnt just all the people that have sold sal im sure theres people here who have got salah and harland as well but when i was doing my check of all the managers around us did you do that as well believe absolutely i couldnt i couldnt quite believe how many how many people had sold him do you have an order who do you have an order of whose teams you look at first of course because you do judge like i dont think its a good thing i dont think its very healthy but you do judge yourself by what other people have done how theyre doing i know im im pretty sure people like ben krin and general dont do this at all because theyre stronger mentally and think that probably affects them and it and theyre probably right theyre definitely right but i always do that when deadline passes i look at what youve done what andys done what late ris has done what slippers has done what raptor i look at his team theres probably about a dozen managers i look at and you like compare your players to their who go hes got him but ive got him and then hes got him and ive got him that can a little bit a little bit im more interested in what transfers theyve made because i dont watch the deadline streams so its its i dont know what is done and things like that so i always like to have a look but its i dont know how healthy that is to compare yourself confirmation bias of b the kid i think i think a lot of it is if people are making similar moves to you it feels quite good it was interesting though because i looked at all the sellar outs and all the harland outs are in and the sells in and i still just feel that theres not enough in it between seller and harand for me to think that hes 100 the way to go i know ss been like unreal and unbelievable but i still find it crazy the points harlands got over the last two weeks and all we can do is forward tell me about it and i dont know i look i look at i look at brighton i look at spurs and i look at salah with villa and and southampton and i think i dont know i dont know whos going to win out in that a people will say its going to be salah but i dont think its that its that clear cut to me i wouldnt i wouldnt be at allall surprised if har came back race against follow no question theres not a massive gap between them but there is a gap in the money thats fact right so its like what can you do with that difference in funds i think also what is facted is city arent in a as good a place as liverpool so thats fact as well right so thats i think on a level playing field salo and harland is not a lot in it and arguably harand sealing is higher i think it is but at the moment poor in this groove of winning matches and salahs just doing what he always does like cu i ive had periods where i havent owned him and you watch him you think when hes not playing well im going to get away with this and then he goes and gets a penalty or goes and gets a couple of assists at the end or gets a late goal and you think hes come out with a nine 10 point return out of what was a poor performance and harlands capable of doing that as well but normally with harland its like its signposted he doesnt normally sneak of a turn its like within the first 20 minutes and youre like god this is going to go bad exactly where salah could just turn it like thats the difference and thats the player he is its true it feels to me though that once hollands gone i feel like thats him gone i dont see how you can weve all used the wild cards or most of have used the wild cards so if youre selling him for salah and okay theres midfields with salah sacker and palmer which look like unbelievable and im seeing some amazing teams out there without harland but what do what are you going to do if you want harlem back and the answer to that is nothing right because youre not going to move youre not if youre if youre taking the harlem money and youre putting it around your team and youre putting into those three assets in midfield i dont see how theres ever going to be a point in which you say okay i dont want salah anymore i dont want palmer anymore im going to move back to harland so youre youre done with him right thats thats how i see it until the wild card i agree i dont think youre getting him back with three transfers no because you have to spread the funds the only point in getting hland out of your team is to spread the funds and hope that makes the difference and in a world in a landscape where we have got palmer saaka son salah and as we said last week a cast of forwards who are doing their job and getting maximum bonus from one goal spreading the funds should compensate should i would say but its the recency bias again isnt it of weve just come off harlands most miserable run in his premier league career for city one goal in five hes i dont think hes done that before if the under if the underlyings were like the same as they had been against newcastle and wolves id be in a very different place and again maybe this is where stats we focus too much on stats so maybe he just isnt a poor era of confidence and hes not going to score but hes getting hes getting so many chances still im h im happy im happy to keep him and see him battle out against the seller the seller owners but theyre both great picks those of good comments coming in that isnt one of them l because hes agreeing with you thanks i love this later on though this is this is from flimy joy bassel bank great name this is like go back to the scout cast hes put a rough with the smoth in look rough b in salah but after too much drinking i forgot to confirm my squad so he sat my my god no sat on the bench the move for fimy was rogers started in place that is a smoth same points same point exactly it is did did he captain well he probably captain somebody else but some lovely stuff coming in and swat saying dont forget to like a lot of people agreeing with you triggers in the chat saying he thinks its easy to buy harand back it is its two transfers i think its a mental thing though is its that its that mental block in terms of youve done the effort to get harland out youve spread the funds and then to almost go back to him feels like youre turning a sea tanker isnt its like i dont i dont agree i dont think back because i think if you if the easiest way to buying back would be to sell salah and i dont see when youre going to sell salah even if he blanked in the next three games which he wont but even if he did it still be like its still seller playing for liverpool hed have to go completely off the rails in the next five or six so to get harand you have to sell one of sacka or palmer youre not going to sell one of sakur or palmer with the run theyve got cuz the fixures are unbelievable youre not going to sell palmer before like home game against wolves or whoever theyre playing are you look sacker before west ham its this is the going to happen were going back to the ticker and the two teams top now this is the blackbox ratings by the way not the default ratings on scout scouts ratings are great but i like to tweak it a bit make forest a bit more difficult lets face it that is a harder game than scout right theyre not bright red theyre a bit less blue but chelsea and arsenal are top of the ticket over the next 12 chelsea got ar they got each other this week but after that they both got a fantastic run of fixtures and city ar far down the ticker but its the next three for city plus if you look at this run for city weve said it before brighton away spurs liverpool forest palace united villa out of that run of eight fixtures seven fixtures right the only game that i would say is straightforward unless i dont think united will be now because amarin the new manager first derby its got to be more difficult for city youd think the only fixure there i would say that city will win maybe easily is palace away but cellers parkss a difficult place to go and by the time by the time they get there in game week 15 glasa might have sorted them out and made them hard to beat at home so i look at that and just i dont think theres an easy game there forest at home would be in a couple of seasons go but i dont think it will be for i look at i watched city last night against sportting i thought if we played for city tomorrow i re and forest have a good chance because we are incredibly hard to break down and incredibly good on the counterattack and i watched city and thought they havent got many ideas at the moment they needed de bry are on the pitch because they just quite predictable they are predict and theyre light in midfield like the team you can play it you can play out against them pretty easily and cut through the defense thats like kovic in that holding role just doesnt work for me and lewis or walker at right back theyre all good players theyre all good players and theyre all capable of a bit of magic on the but i would think looking at this brighton are going to fancy it spurs are going to fancy it liverpool are definitely going to fancy it and unless de bru is fully fit and harlands firing again i think forest will go to the ead with the best chance of getting something theyve had since theyve come up no question no question at all so i dont think an easy game there for them im im im giving haren the next two brighton and spurs i think i probably will sell him ahead of liverpool away because i could move him down to salah whos whos hes got the home game or over to sacka whos got west ham which i like ar arsenal havt exactly been great arsenal last night were pretty dire they had a lot of the ball but again it was predictable there a lot of crosses to a center forward who doesnt exist j jezus came on and couldnt generate much from that sacka was double teamed all the time and was frustrated and couldnt martin n is not offering enough down that side and od guards not there odard cominging back well talk about it late is huge absolutely huge and so weve got odard and de coming back into these two teams it could make the world a difference lets look at some data though lets start because were probably going to run on to three hours otherwise but good chat good chat so far lovely comments as well coming in so its good defense for the season a few things i want to mention here and its not forest villa what did you make of the 41 at spurs when defensive dat theyre four feir 099 xg conceded non penalty per 90 and they were second i think on this table going into the spurs game theyve slipped down now its crazy isnt it i dont know whats going on with villa they seem both frustrating as a defensive unit even though the data is good and a little bit limited in attack i look at watkins and hes only had more than two shots in one game all season wow thats a hell of a stat that is i had a look in most games hes getting one or two shots but hes only had three in one fixture so far and he needs the watkins of old needs volume like hes a better player now and hes better at taking his chances but my preconception of watkins before last season was where hes going to need five or six chances to score i dont know if hes a striker who with if he only had two shots in the game could get the numbers he got last season what do you think about that when i watch villa i think when theyre on song and its and its clicking between biley rogers duran watkins theyve got like ramsey coming on t theyve got players who when they link up and play well it looks vibrant and its attacking football and quick like transitions across the pitch looks good but theres been quite there been a couple of games now where you watch them and it just looks a bit laborious it looks a bit slow and that was happening against spurs and then when villa scored from the set piece i thought well thats thats it now like this is happened to spurs so many times they been in complete control conceded the goal and now theyre going to fall apart and they didnt they just they just carried on doing what they were doing before and once they got one it was just a matter of time before villa crumbled because they werent offering no anything when wers went off they were like just limp i dont know what hes so key hes so key to them morgan rogers its unbelievable didnt didnt see that i thought hed be a good pick for us at 5m but i didnt think hed be like the talis almost the talisman of the team after 10 weeks dont know whats missing i dont know what it maybe its lewis has left and he was a big figure last season anal has come in and hes perhaps not as mobile hes not as dynamic with the ball and theyve missed lewiss set pieces because that was a big factor he was he was a master of those wasnt he mcin seems less of influence biley definitely is the fullbacks definitely are as well rogers and watkins have looked okay but theyve looked like their partnership is absolutely key if thats not on song theyre struggling its its weird theres a lot of teams in that bracket i would say is when they sold dougas louise i thought this might be the problem theyd have because he was that eight role who box the box just linked everything so well they signed anana and i thought okay anas more defensive at least he has been a everton and then when he signed he started getting them the goals in the first couple of weeks i was thinking they want something here theyve made a like for like placement with a player that i didnt expect but i do wonder if now they just they just seem to be missing that energy like in the midfield between the defense and the attack which louise gave him so well and that ability with him to pass the ball he his passing was unreal last season he could pick a ball out from from right across the havent got anyone thats looking up and trying to put a ball over the top so much like watkins isnt getting as many i thought villa against spurs watkins would be thr on goal like over and over and over again without there but it just didnt seem to happen and spurs played well i thought drasin played well in that game but i didnt feel like they tested them that often by trying to put those balls over the top and trying to get watkins involved and i was surprised at that cu i thought that was probably their best their best weapon matt saying its all about fixtures it is but lets have a look at their fixtures if you look at the short term theyre theyre pretty bad liverpool away palace at home chelsea away its all about the home games palace brenford sampton youd think that they would im certainly brenford and sampton and youre gna youre going to hold rogers probably for those two but the away games are tough for them so its theyre one of those teams that have got fixtures that are on off on off on off theres no sustained spell other than those two bren that brenford santon over a longer period theyre right down there like over the 12 theyre third from bottom so it i also think as well lo losing to club bruge was that tyro mings picking the ball up and giving a penalty thats a bad result for them because they were flying through that and coasting and now that palace game looks good the one sandwiched in between chelsea and liverpool but then theyve got juventus after that palace game so youve got to think watkins isnt going to see 90 minutes in that game they might even take rogers off early in that they play brenford and southampton back to back but after southampton which is arguably the best game you can have this season they then go away to red bull leig and juventus will be an interesting game because if they lose that game to juventus and then theyve got to go away to red bull li theres suddenly going to be a lot of pressure on them to get a result in that match so again we talked about jackson before and how hes starting every game and watkins and the duran threat but there could be more rotation coming i think particularly over this period because of though the import if theyd beaten club brouge i think that it might have eased it a little bit but losing one nil was wasnt a game i dont think they could afford to lose its 8 nil chelsea at the moment 8 n my god first team out i know the other thing i want to say about villa is jan right and when rogers went off it was interesting never talk of an injury but he didnt want to go off and emory said interestingly i dont think the injury is too bad because he didnt want to come off but i wanted to get i wanted to get two forwards on ive got thoughts on it does make me wonder that because jan is there and hes like on a leash and hes proving himself and he wants to get starts as soon as theres an opportunity to get him on the pitch emorys is like ill take that because in the back of his mind hes thinking if as soon as theres a window where i should consider putting jan on im going to take it so as soon as rogers got a knock but hes off get emory get jan on and itll be the same for watkins as well like so that is a thing when youre take when if youre owning watkins and rogers if they get with 20 minutes to go there is no question theyre coming off because hes looking for a chance to get duran in on the pitch to keep him appeased now maybe thats speculative but thats how it seemed to me in that game because i dont think i think rogers could have stayed on and they might have done better my thoughts on morgan roggers in that game and im a big morgan rogers fan dont get me wrong because i takes of a pinch of salt but dont complain about getting subbed off if youre going to spend 5 minutes rolling around on the floor okay crying in pain and then your manager subs you off and you go what are you doing im fine dont roll around then just get up get on with it if youre fine get up you think hed know you think you think watkins and rogers go on thinking durans gonna come on with 15 20 minutes to go so let me let me make sure i dont give em a chance ive never ive never ive never seen like it cuz like so when son got subbed he was he looked good he was running around and he was like what are you doing r just got subbed and did the same reaction youve been rolling on the floor for 5 minutes man lets move on city slipped down here chances per 976 which is extraordinary clean sheet slow as we said we talked about lewis andard already united the big chances is the highest though so when they are getting a chance its 23 big chances conceded per 90 palace have got three theyre city are certainly the biggest in the top 10 arent they other than bournemouth so they are conceding the wider big open chances yes and arsenal have slipped down and suddenly liverpool and forest are the two best defenses 81 089 dont laugh united what you make united because with the new manager amarin coming in the talk is all about bruno and well talk about bruno in a bit any anything making you think maybe we should reconsider the defense cuz its its 14th here so this would cons this would say no but theyve had the most clean sheets have they this season theyve done second most one at one point theyd had the most i dont thats thats continued but i think i think it might beings must bep four clean sheets liverpool got five liverpool got six i believe for they were at one point they the most but now its now its okay now theyre third but still its its not bad i am getting swept up in the amarim hype you are already are you i am i cant help it you watch that performance that they put in against city and you see the way hes got them playing and if you watch monday night football as well you saw some of the stats that hes bought into to sporting this is the bias i was talking about with some if you watch too much of this you get youre going to end up buying gar you got it too late that was before as well youre so vulnerable i know but like top for progressive carries top for bl shots top for xg top for goals all the things and okay its what cara described as a league enough just a bit but and man utd arent arent one of the top teams in the league so its going to be a difference but i think it is exciting i think ive been watching a lot of like tactics videos about him were going to do a bit on am him in a bit but its its going to be to see whether he comes in and tries to stamp the the three the back formation the wing backs the three rotating sing side forwards all play or whether he keeps going with what ruds rud then t been doing so i dont i think you if youre going to if youre going to buy into it you have to buy into it now because of the next three pictures its got to be the attack lad rather than the defense i would have thought well look at well look at it in a bit its interesting because you said about when you watch tactics thing i think it does affect you before the season started i did a lot of work on moresco and slot and i looked into slots tactics if you remember i showed formations on here didnt i and i thought out of that i thought this is could have influenced me and it did cuz what i did well there was two things i could have done i could have gone diaz cuz i was convinced that one of the wingers was going to be more inverted than the other and i thought it would be diaz with salah staying wide and that is what weve seen so i could have gone diaz that would have worked out well i didnt go df did i went bloody quono instead you got it right for 45 minutes i got it right for 4 cuz i went ill go qu cuz hes going to play and hes a four million defender and hes definitely going to prefer the ball playing defender cuz thats how slot likes to play so rather than take the diaz lesson which would have been marvelous cuz he got like five goals in the first three or four game weeks i went for bloody quono which last his 45 minutes im so gutted i know you it does affect you doesnt it when youve when you think youre on to summit i go im gonna go for that so you got to be careful gotta be careful but you were you were right to go for it you just went for the wrong one of the of the of the two options you call liverpool being a a good team but a more functional team a less chaotic al then again coming from klopp it was always going to be a slightly less chaotic team but i dont think i can claim that saying liverpool a good team is that much of a grand move i but i think i was expecting more of a more of a drop off from them than weve seen i thought it was a big job to replace such a legend in club and i thought there might be a bit of adjustment period or a bit of time to take but theyve been absolutely unreal outstanding top of the defense not top of attack because spurs at top of the attack and i dont think that is surprising given what we saw against villa and it is the basis on which ive gone fre spurs hoping that would get returns its surprised that he chelsea up there but then they banged in eight tonight and that explains why palmer from game rout 12 is such a priority what is surprising is arsenal i think theyre not the best defense now thats been carrying them theyre like four in the defensive data based on xg on penalty conceded theyre down in six here 158 behind united liverpool chelsea city and spurs but od guards back and that could unlock them right i hope that does i hope the handbreak comes off a bit and hav herz and sacka become im not scared of havs and sacka at the moment for me though thats that the difference is odard i just i just think there completely different team to judge when theyve got him in the side and when they havent cuz when you look at the front three when you look at the midfield three of what marino rice and well part has been playing at right back for a bit hasnt he played midfield last night its been hav havit have been dropping in isnt he to the eight and its just theres just no theres no creativity there is theres nothing theres no one that can unlock defenses in that midfield three they and martinelli dont bring enough to the party do they they and theyve both been poor theyve both been poor this season they were last jayus if i was if i was playing against arsenal and i saw martinelli trossard and gabriel jayus in the side i wouldnt be filled with fear like theyre good theyre good players but theyre not league winning theyre squad players in my opinion and then you look at that midfield fre and you think well who in that midfield rice is going to run around and do a great job and hes got a lot of talent dont get me wrong 80m pound player he runs around a bit but hes not whos whos going to be the person to play that killer ball through and if they do play the killer ball through whos whos getting on the end of it i dont they ring theyre relying so much on sacka and you can hes not easy to shut down lets face it hes getting harder by the season to shut down but you can they did a good job on him last night and it showed how you could restrict them when you do that and theyre desperate to get odard back theres no question and i think i would then expect them to climb this table and weve said if you look at the long ticker theyre right up there for the fixtures and from game 12 onwards or maybe 13 west ham away thats where you got to get on them i think again theres a brilliant comment in the chat if you could if you could flag out from no weak foot just saying they need smith row that what that is that is exactly who they need well he would have played wouldnt he would have played i think he would have played i think i think hed be starting i think hed be starting the matches that odard was out if they had him in because they havent got another player that can drive with the ball like he does and play a ball through to some of these forwards and wingers i think theyre it doesnt surprise me at all to see arsenal sick on this list because i just i think theyre quite i think theyre quite ordinary at the moment but we expect them to pick up and we expect them to climb his table again and threaten united attack is up there we talked about the defense does the presence of them fing this table 160 before amarin gets there does that make you even more tempted to go all in well the issue the issue the issue isnt so much the stat this year is the lack of goal i think theyre 18th for goals lack of goals this season or like that and again you look at the team and think where the goals going to come from because holand isnt i dont think hollands a 20 25 goal a season striker rashford hasnt been on it for ages garnacho is wasteful you could argue amad deserves to start but hes i think hes got a couple tonight but id be probably more surprised than not if he if he started the weekend so where the goals coming from are the goals going to come from fernandez is he going to l step up well he hasnt scored more than 10 goals in his last three years is he maybe im completely wrong with that but definitely id be surprised if hes i can tell getting more than that you go there you go you go thats go bang on bang on 10 goals in bang on 10 goals thats his premier league career so his best season 32 returns 2021 when we were talking about him being the new king of fbl even over salo at that point god its not great is it and its been its been deed since 19 goal returns last season though 34 of the goal involvement hes on 33 goal involvement this season because united have been so poor at scoring goals hes only had three returns but that three returns is enough to get him a third of the my god it just shows you doesnt it how theyve struggled because theyve only scored theyve only scored nine goals and which i think its southampton has scored fewer so amarin has got a bit of a bl canvas but hes got a lot to do isnt he and brunos got to be the player that lets have a look at lets have a look at uniteds cast here zi we can we can count out on the grounds that hes put on some timber apparently acc report apparently hes hes a stone heavier than he should be according to v tenar when he left your man gun atos up there in terms of points per xg i non penalty per 52 just ahead of bruno and gacher is the more palatable if youre going to go anywhere because its 63 compared to 82 for me though its about losing a midfield slot to united player im not sure im ready for that im okay im okay with v next three this is the thing because there is no better fixtures than lester rip switch and everton if you were to pick three fixtures it would be those two maybe west ham would be one of them but definitely or south hampton if you had all three pr teams in a row in terms of in terms of a three i think thats thats excellent the question is if amam comes in doesnt matter what tactics he brings in doesnt matter what formation he changes what players he brings off the bench or whatever there isnt players in the team who can score goals hes got to change that mentality and hes got to get them scoring and i look at that cast that youve got on there and whos going to fly in that who is who is going to be the one that steps up and starts banging in the goals theres a lot on brunos got to get 10 goals again if you go back at these numbers he got 10 goals last season 10 in 2122 hes got to hit double figures again hasnt he because i dont i think youre absolutely right you look at this and think im not sure gacho can holand might be able to if he trans to me hs the one though holand is the one that needs to step up because hes the only nine in that team xery isnt isnt good enough this season i dont think hes going to need time hes more of a link player isnt hes not hes not an out his reputation isnt that of a goal scorer necessarily they cant s rashford up front because that doesnt work they tried that they tried that every year and it doesnt work so do try it every year its only highlands there that can do it so he needs to start scoring more regularly has to i me hes got it in him but i just think hes still one maybe even two seasons away from his peak well he is need to st need to stay fit need to have a prolong period without in injury but i think its youre right i think its its not just tactics and formation its mentality if you look at we look at this amarins going to turn up and we think hes going to favor a 3421 and these both these images are both courtesy of skys recent article by the way which ive in danger of being biased by reading that but im not im not going to go all in on united as might be open to persuasion but i dont know how quickly hes going to move to this whether hell land and go right three at the back wing backs will he will he do that do you think or will it take time cuz i was looking at like predicted lineups for manest united if they if they switch this formation and they have three good center backs for this formation in yoro martinez and delit well yoro isnt fit and hes 18 years old so i dont see how he can play delict and maguire in a back three the teams are going to eat that up for breakfast ar thats martinez carrying a lot then in that so i dont think he can go to a back three if its until yos yos back theyve got ma do for the wing back slots and sure if hes if hes ever fit they could also play gono at left wing back i was going to ask whether you think hes going to end up at wing back he could do is interesting because he tends to be the right wing back thats the more attacking one and thats thats what the graphic thats what the graphic shows here sporting average positions under ammer in its its right hand side thats where is the more attacking side so thats dow thats got to be thats got to be dow i would have thought mazra is a good player but if youre and it could be fernandez if youre going to bring in the most attacking for wing back is its going to be dow on that side i dont know if gacho is totally suited for a left wing back role is unless youre just telling him to stay past the halfway line his work rate isnt no isnt the best is it well if hes going to end up there teams are going to target that arent they teams i would i would no question my cameras gone off no question at all that they would target that but i its its the right side midfield behind the forward which will be holand which is interested thats where we think bruno is going to play right it has to be it has to it has to be bruno because the two center mids have got to do so much running and youve got to think thats going to be mayo and agat right because that is thats what they do thats like the roll in the so they seem perfect for this system in the midfield and bruno seems perfect in one of those inside forward spots i think when united have got like a fully fit team i think it works because youve got martinez deck and and yoro youve got shaw on the left youve got dallow on the right ugat and casir is just out isnt he ugat and and mayu and then youve got fernandez rashford and hland that works but if you take a couple of those players out through injury or whatever suddenly i dont think the system they havent got the squad to i dont know to keep to keep the momentum or to make changes i dont i just dont see how he how he brings this in straight away and implements it he needs players i think he needs time and i dont think he goes to this straight away you have no sound mark what have you done i was so well sorry i was interrupting you anyway i muted to get my camera back on he needs a transfer window doesnt he he does i think so i think that hes one or two key players from this formation i dont i dont think hes got enough deb foot win back to play this week in week out he hasnt got that center back like you say thats fit and i dont know if rashford and bruno are going to play behind the striker in those rols bruno definitely can rashford it could it could be amad like a few like a few people are saying but thats a big step up it just feels like to wear pegs to me it does a little bit a little bit considering the pressure hell be under to get results i think hell rethink it and stay with the four at the back initially and then do what he see what he can do in january basic thats way hell go all right lets look at the regular stats of players not too much to talk about as always other than the fact that you take allison out the equation because hes injured on his way back ss is the best keeper now in terms of points per 90 48 which is crazy you ruined him for everyone i blame you entirely i not good enough just didnt see it at all but hes been outstanding four clean sheets but been bring in some saves and bonus as well wanted to talk about onana here cuz he done well with the four clean sheets of mention and that could be if you want to go united im sure united fans are itching to get more players in and nana could be a logical step because he has done well even under tag so youd think there could be an improvement under amarin as well fleen weve already talked about so theres theres not too much movement here other than i think that reyya will come again i think with the fixtures weve seen given where arsenal are on the ticker and from game 13 onwards i dont think forest at home is an easy game but i dont it could be a clean sheet i dont know about you but i do expect to want to move back to two arsenal defenders from about from 12 13 ors are you thinking ive got them ive got two ive still got ry ive got ive got gabrielle its been a rough ride up until now but i look at that run forest west ham man utd fulham everton palace ipswitch brenford 12 right till 19 thats what eight games its easy to say isnt it youd expect three or four clean sheets minimum from those if i was picking a goalkeeper from gw 12 it would be ryer so im happy to im happy to have him i think that when i move harland out some of the money that is cleared will be to try and move back to two arsenal defenders you wont keep i find it hes done all right for me hes got a couple of falls so hes got hes had a couple to be fair he has he has but i dont want to take him beyond like this is with good fixtures as well it was interesting though to watch brenford atam and they said that they spoke to frank before the game and they said would you take a one nil or 43 what you prefer he goes always a 43 and then his team put on the most flaccid performance ive seen for some time right well it was it was ridiculous wasnt it was like were were won that up thats just it cooper it was i couldnt believe i couldnt believe i was watching of all the teams of all the managers to put in performance like that i could not believe it was it was brenford it was ridiculous it was like 45 shots was it to like four it was it ando was just nothing he was more fullback than a winger wasnt he he played down the middle come it was strange so i do wonder whether frank is suddenly going what im tired of the four threes and lets go but because they were once a side that were built on a bit of discipline at the back set pieces when they first came up thats how they build thats thats what you do when you get promoted its what forest did you have to grind out results they became a bit more of a flare team who scored goals this season and played a different style of football which just left them open i do wonder if hes like time to move the dial back but he doesnt want to admit that be interesting but theres no doubt find the middle ground you dont you dont need to be up there or bloody on the bottom find a nice middle ground you got to attack fulham a little bit i dont agree with sexy b saying is rough two world is an injury time i dont think it was rough at all i think it was completely deserved completely deserved that f and won that game they didnt brenford here 15th for the defensive weight data 171 they did have a tough start but theyve had good fixtures recently remind me what their fixtures are like short long term theyre pretty bad now so theyve got these three ever leer then it falls off a cliff right theres no way im taking fle into that one it will be saves gore but villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton ars theyre not theyre not getting anything from thems getting a 50 pointer in one of those games a one nil a one nil against chelsea away wheres the clean sheet coming there villa newcastle chelsea forest but hell do it to sp because thats what thats what these players love to do they love to spite us im even looking in buo and thinking i dont know if i want him over that run no ill be selling hes hes too highly owned i think to keep and thats thats thats pure black box that is too highly owned to keep too highly owned to hes boring isnt he everyones got him you dont even get you dont even celebrate his points when they when they come in villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton arsenal nah we can do better in midfield i think over that certainly be sing the analytics crew will be shouting skill issue at you now i saying that and me for saying it as well hes on pens 90 minute man ever present perfect algorithms absolutely love him regardless of fixtures but i think youre right i think that if youre trying to push up trying to push towards 100k which is what weve got to be aiming for you perhaps have to roll the dice against inmo for that run because its dismal theres no question y the question is where you go but we can cross that bridge when we get to midfield in a minute i dont want to talk too much about tread because we did that last week but simas he is he is now the starter and hes third in this table 026 which theres a whole gaggle of defenders around that 02 bracket trent out on top 036 so above them but only just its not a huge margin and with the it test as weve seen simic talk to me about him 4 six taking set pieces has that more quality than robertson i would say in terms of delivery and in terms of xgi outperformed trent in that game last weekend i think he came out 056 and trent if i remember the walkout video was about 015 dismal like that so simcast definitely can offer us something how close now are you is it week by week were getting closer to letting trent go how close are you sim is on my wall there on side after the after the bench boost last year so a big fan i dont necessarily think hes a step up from robertson i think he is this season because robertson has declined in a lot of areas because hes getting on a bit and fair enough i dont feel like sim is like a new signing whos a great left back necessarily i think hes a squad player who has been thrust into the role because robertson has gone down i wonder if theyre going to move in january for a new left back and man utd are going to be moving for a new left back as well its a very popular england dont even have a left back so its its a its a highly sought after position with not too many options available so be see what they what they do trent like you said i think we need to talk about trent a little bit because again i dont think the run of fixtures liverpool have got lends themselves so well to clean sheets coming forward i think after that southampton game its what everton its newcastle its man city as well and its going to be hard for him to justify 7m unless hes getting more regular returns attacking wise because theres so many defenders who are getting good attacking returns would i move trent to simas not a chance you would not a chance youre just youre just i would go anywhere near simas i just dont think robertson comes in every now and then and plays gomez can play on the left as well cant he could come in for a game i dont think simas is like too far ahead of either of them so avoid for me okay and you im look at liverpools fixtures theyre not great i dont believe theyre okay theyve got that city newcastle 134 which is tough way im looking at this thinking wheres the clean sheets coming from here villa i think they can keep a clean sheet against villa they certainly can against sampton but after that i think the next three or four very tough because theyve got city newcastle everton and spurs they can go a good as some part plenty teams can but its a bit different when its a spicy derby isnt it even calv louis might score in that one but i think i think theres clean sheets there for sure but in a world where those fixtures are tougher the problem with trent is i just i want it to happen i want that game to happen where he just gets those couple of attacking returns and everyone goes ah i do need him i do need him after all well hopefully its going to be one of the next two because its filler and southampton and then its the poor run if were selling harland and were selling trent where the hells all our money going its true kogo you think that min is going to come back in dont you dont think that role on the right side in front of elmans going to be his you think he what moves back to left back at that point then do you im very surprised hes been he started so many on the wing because gruda is there as well whos very highly rated hz said he was excited to work with him but clearly hasnt hasnt done that i wonder if maybe r could move over to the right now we got pedro coming back and oreillys back in the squad too so and ms back in training so i cant see any world in which kyogo carries on a right wing theres too many options that can come in look out for o al by the way hes hes absolute quality i saw you tweet today about well theres a number of players who can play the 10 it wont take long before oreilly gets the 10 and its and its his in my book i think hes well then the question where do pro then where does pedro play its its a problem because i think oreilly is going to be a starter very quickly because i just think hes exactly what you need for me hes so technically good hes a scorer of goals and a creator i think we need a pascal gr we need a pascal in that 10 hes not as consistent as gross so and he has been in a weaker league so lets see how he adjusts theres no question but hes got all the tools so i would have thought that he will end up being your 10 by the end of the season just how quickly he goes in i dont think hes going to be a fantasy asset not yet he could be next season though so c gl said no not much going there well whoa well i dont i dont i dont think he is a no i just think if youre expecting him to start on the wing again youre probably unlikely i still think with brightons fixtures after c i was gonna say even are strong right even if he plays at left back i think hes a good option i think hes starting to adjust to the league now i think hes first choice i think he plays every game i think hes hes the best defender weve got and the best one of the best players in the squad now he was signed of a massive reputation and were starting to see that coming through i would expect some clean sheets over the run of southampton fulham leicester palace west ham so you go you go over you go cadog over dunk or barco would you very good i still think barco could come good at some point but sorry im joking id go id go kogu dunk was dunk was interesting at the start of the season because we thought the set piece threat would be there but hasnt materialized i think kloo is the one hes a bit riskier than dunk but he offers a bit more okay okay i put some chelsea defenders at the end of the table here none of them featur in the top 30 well they dont its not they dont but chelseas fixtures are very strong and were all about parmer from the attack as well we havent touched on sanchez as an option any chelsea defenders tempted you at all i think its interesting reese james coming back what you make of that not going in for reese no hes not he doesnt look the same player at the moment is he hes trying to build fitness up but he looks like it might take him a little while to get going gusto is the one thats maybe more impressive because hes inverting a bit a bit more and getting forward but i wonder if thats going to carry on maybe when james is back to his best he go moves back to right back they got i dont see i think its going to be inversion on the other side its its just whether karella takes gustos minutes away thats the thing and he could because karella is more natural perhaps in that role i just dont theres just not a lot to like is there about the defense they con see goals they theres theres like rotation around those more attacking spots youre not going to go for cwi or for far cuz theres much more attacking options for the same price hard aoid and the thing is as well like we said it didnt we earlier in the show its like there were four fives like davis like eight nori who offer you a bit more in attack and gusto and karella cant even though theyre inverted they cant compete with that they need the clean sheets if chelsea suddenly turn into like a defensive juggernaut then maybe we can consider them but maybe i just i just cant see it fair enough midfield then lets look at that the bos top which for ages has not been worth a mention but hes coming back and it was interesting to see him i dont cant work out what pep was doing last night that night wasnt last night before wasnt it 41 down they go 31 down and n gallagher expert co comor that he is was calling out for he was he was doing cooms did you see that no gallagher no he was doing no he was doing he was doing co coms with dan fletcher and i cant remember who was on with fletch but it was it was no g gone i know so they had they had a shamelessly saying were going to have a fan of one of the teams as a co commentator ive never seen that and he was saying promoting the tour and stuff he probably gave him a lot of money about ive never cuz he kept saying we he kept saying were this and were that great its great isnt it when a when a co commentator is so unbiased but no gallagher was saying this games crying out for kevin he was thats the other thing he was doing hes calling players by their first name because who does that yes as if no gallagher gets to wander into the city dressing room when he likes to have drink well he probably does so fair enough but yes i know what youre getting out there but he was he was saying brennan he was saying this games crying out for kevin at 31 down and he was right i was like well they need a bit of invention maybe kevin can come on see im doing it now he can come on and turn it no he doesnt bring it him on then so we were like thinking well he cant be fit then can he cant if hes not coming on now hes not going to come on he cant be fit hes on the bench to make up the numbers they go 41 down with five minutes of stoppage time to go and pep goes come on kev on you come whats that about hes just come back from injury the games gone theres five minutes left game gone youre right why would you put de boy on i just i know that im not pep none of us are pep and i know hes a genius but even luke i think would struggle to work out what pep was thinking there with the game finished and with five minutes to go thats when you go ill tell you what kevs been out for months but they stick him on see how he does in the last five minutes very strange decision but it was it was also strange that he was on the bench for bournemouth and they were 21 down desperate for a goal and they dont bring him on in that game is like whats the point of him even being on the bench in that point of him being on the bench in either of those games youve got to think that its it is a numbers thing rather than name three keepers theyre putting de bruyer on and then if theyre desperate they bring him on and i get it but why bring him on when youre 41 down in a game that theyre not knocked out as a result of losing that game so why try and hes not going to turn it around is he in five minutes the only thing i can think of is hes trying to give de bruyne like a psychological lift that hes been out for a while and now hes gets to come back and feel the grass under his feet and hear the crowd and all thats but that is clutching thats all ive got imagine someone gone through him and hes out for the season just because of that five surely you i dont know who am i to question pep but i thought it was odd well he done it before with de bry didnt he de bry was out for the whole preseason and then he chucked him into that first game was it last year or maybe the year before and then he was out for like four months and then pep was like i probably shouldnt have played him in that game he wasnt ready whyd you do it then anyway what you make of that impact on thoden we expect it to help harland because deyne is elite when it comes to creating chances theres no theres no one in the league like him thats why hes top of his table do you i cant see foden operating out wide and bernardo silva starts so surely de brer back means fod and becomes more of a question mark right is a strange one because i cant see a world where foden gets a prolonged period of time out of the team because of do you not his quality well no because hes hes just hes just one player of the season and he in the games ive seen even the last few hes hes hes hes hes hes been very influential in the last couple of games i know they havent won but he scored the goal against sporting he had a good game i thought against bournemouth created loads of opportunities in that created like what four big chances in the game against southampton as well the issue is like you say is where you playing because theyve got savio on the right who i think is excellent foden we know from last year worked best with walker bobbing past him so he could tuck into the middle not going to get that so much with lewis so does he play in its him and de bruyne in midfield but then they havent got the wheres berard going then but the trouble is they havent got the they havent got the cover cuz its all right to do that when youve got rod doing the work all the dirty work behind you they have to play gundan and cover have to play dont they i dont think i dont think gans been good at all since hes come back from barcelona so i think theyve got a real its obvious to say theyre missing rodri but when the replacements arent stepping up its a big problem and youre right i bernardo would move over to the left but then theyve got nunes there as well havent they i dont know i think it is a problem for foden ive got ive got one more week with him i think he against brighton hes got a good record against us as well but then i think he is an issue but i dont see how he can not play him but then i dont see how he can play consistently i think de bruy just doesnt play every game i know i think i think if youre gna play de brer its going to be in europe and its going to be the tougher teams its going to be the games that you wont fow them in the easier fixures i think were still going to get that but its going to be interesting mojo saying i dont hes trying to give him some minutes and a done game whats weird about that cuz it was a stoppage time it was the injury time he brought him on for 5 minutes isnt going to benefit ala did it with oard last night as well didnt he gave him like two or but the game wasnt out of reach it was 41 so its like with odard coming on you think well he might do something to get them a point still late though i dont know why you they were one goal behind so i could sign of see the logic of it like he might 10 minutes though but i still thought it was even though i agree the de one the de one the de bruyne one is weird i think it will when de bruyer is playing i think it will have an impact on ph i think it probably means he goes out to the right still but we think hes less effective there with without walk cup so indeed diaz and salah diaz with a hattrick i said in my walkout video that it was only salah and then diaz goes and get the hatrick to shut me up what you think its going to happen this is this is its going to be like this all season jot comes back scores a brace diaz gets a goal gakpo suddenly is the best its im just not going near it youre i cant be i cant be dealing with it i do think though di diaz should be playing through the middle over darwin do you i like thats that gakpo diaz salah is that is a potent front could that be a thing i think so cuz so i think darwins been all right but i still dont think hes got a longterm future so in a world where diaz starts looking like he could play centrally well then that then i think that change when js back though youve still got that question mark around diaz and j but if js out for a while and diaz is playing through the middle then but 100 you said tonight you were in a sleeper call and you said that dan fbl mate offered us bowden for diaz he feels diaz end up being down the middle that isnt quite that isnt quite what happened i tried to pressure him into selling phone for diaz what are you doing without my permission we assistant manager you we comanagers what you well i thought once it once we got the offer then we could talk about it was i had to i had to give it the big the big talk at the time to try and get the off from the table youre just trying to get your own back for the fact that i turned down himz for intia i kept intia now hes injured and i missed out on all that did you turn it down turned it down i thought we missed it i was saying today i thought we miss turn it down also threw an insult sal as way and think do you think were stupid you might be able to catch us back from the pub i was i was always after that anyway that would have been a great move thanks eddie will come good dont worry a couple of years be fine palmer injury just a load of nonsense injury if he if he doesnt play ill eat this hoodie there you go i cant help but think that mesas gone okay alessas playing nonsense with sacka and all this stuff about you not pitched in the training picks and they play arsenal next and palmer is like palmers a player that would if arsenal thought he wasnt playing it could completely change their tactics so you got to think the mesas like well there could be he has hes not trained today and all this he hasnt trained because hes not playing in europe and we know that and he wasnt in any of the picks and all this stuff and its i dont know maybe im wrong for me the martinez challenge the contact was minimal it wasnt a regular challenge i know moresa said that and youre right but to me it didnt look like there was enough contact to make palmer injured out for the weekend but well see i think i think it was quite a quite a nasty knock and it is the thing that i could see being a bit of an impact injury that keeps you out of training for a couple of days but theres absolutely no way theres enough in that to keep you out of chelsea versus arsenal with the way chelsea are playing and at a time when arsenal were beatable at the moment this isnt the arsenal of like the end of last season when theyre winning every game chelsea look at that game and think we can do them over it theres just no way palmer doesnt play that game he just 100 im like 999 reoccurring percent sure he starts hell get patched up and play i dont think chelsea do it but well see when we get to predictions what i think there but i think that palmer plays for sure absolutely its not muscular its a knock thats thats the key thing and he and hes with the england squad as well and he would have they would have pulled him out of that moresa could have used this as an opportunity to pull him out of the england squad and said hes got a bit of a i re its palmer saying dont pull me out of it because im ive got to make a st for tel im fine see i buy that son will be a target if bren if palmer is out the natural thing would be for those without spurs players going into the it switch game if palmer is known as out you move salah if you can if you havent got him but i would have thought son would be the natural step down if before the break and then you have to go back to palmer after that if you add palmer and he is rolled out would you hold him through the break for 12 given that thats when we need him for that fixture run or would you move him out and spend two transfers what would you do and the other question i did the qa with sam for scout earlier and shes shes on a w so the moment shes got palmer and no son and i said to her why dont you well and she agreed like wouldnt you go for like son move to palmer afterwards because she havent got she hasnt got value tied up in him either shes buying palmer for the first time on the wild card youre booking in a transfer and everything like that i can see why you might not do it but even take taking a one if youre going to take a one week punt on a player son surely is the one that you take the punt on got some minutes in europe tonight home game against ip switch s hes arguably the best captain this week isnt he if you were free hitting youd be very tempted to give him the cabin you because hes got the pens right so thats the edge hes got over salanki and koseski and brennan and that is the pens right no well and johnson i could call him jonno if you like jonno its even worse but im im im i think thats the thats the step down that people will do it is a step down in price and then you have to get palmer back once he year fit i dont think its going to be i think its a nonissue no question though if youre i think youre right on the wild card if youre wild card in this week like sam is you go in you go all in on spurs dont you and then exit out game week 12 surely you go porro salanki and son dont you if you wild i think so unless youre taking palmer out and losing like triggers put in the in the chat if youre losing like 3 2 3 then i dont think you do but if you havent owned palmer like some idiots you and i up until up until now i think i think you definitely go for go for some go fair enough lets take on forwards then not too much to talk about that i want to talk about j pedro though hes not high in his table because he hasnt been about hes 23rd 35 x on ped per 90 coming back though with those good fixtures and he then enters the conversation that has been dominated by the likes of himz wood kuna recently i would say cal le but i dont want to keep mentioning him where do you stand on jia pedro do you like i know the algorithm is absolutely love him and theyre throwing him at me going hes on pedal is hes gonna they love him the models love jaia pedro so hes hes going to find his way back into teams isnt he well hell find his way back into teams but will he find his way back into the team thats the thats the big question thats what im asking you as the brighton f as the expert very brave asking me to predict brighton i feel like ive completely lost my what im im not even going to try and predict what the what the 11s going to be but what i will say is that weve got some good strikers for the first time in quite a few seasons who were playing 90 minutes weve got chriswood weve got kuna you could we got salanki you got nicholas jackson with good fixtures youve got vissa you might be keeping harland these are all you got welbeck whos playing like every minute as well havs with great arsenal fix you got so many good fix so many good players do you want to bring in a player who if he starts and he plays for brighton will score points because hes a great player and hes got penalties but he has such an unbelievable amount of competition that none of those other players have in his position i do think herz loves him though does hes hes said things to give us indication that hes he sees him as the man the player who can turn a game so absolutely but youve got rutter playing in the 10 at the moment whos been exceptional for about five or six weeks now so i dont think i dont think joe i think i think hes been i think hes been more than all right i think hes been brilliant i think hes been an excellent player and hes our record signing as well i think its very harsh if pedros fit and comes straight back in and replaces russer i think p i still think pedros ive said this all season im probably gonna be completely wrong i still think pedros best chance of getting into the team is as a nine and taking the place of welbeck can taking the place of wont do it wont happen it will it will not happen this side of christmas theres no way so hes either taking mats place on the left or hes taking the 10 weve got oreilly back like weve mentioned weve got r who i think has been playing well you got three players for one position why would you go there when youve got other strikers who are first choice talking of other options i havent mentioned either hazards or isac but theyre theyre edging havit with the fixtures hes edging back into the picture isach with a little bit of form how close what would they have to do to get you looking their way esack is someone i want i hes the fixtures are good look right the fixtures are good and hes hes one of those one of those strikers on penalties talisman of the team and i just think newcastle was just starting to turn a little bit of a corner with the way theyre playing football now theyve got a system thats working for they always look a bit more on it great win against arsenal to give him a bit of confidence as well and that west ham game in 12 i know thats the thing is it cuz 12 is the pivot thats where we all probably have two or three transfers and we go harland out palmer in and then its like who comes in for harland and theres jackson in the equation theres kuna maybe would but the fixtures are turning isaks got havitz will be in that picture because all right forest isnt easy but after that its west ham united fulham everton palace hit which good run but isaks going to be in that in that in a weeks time or after the international break when were sitting here doing this show then were going to be talking about where we go and isach and havit are going to be on the menu arent they well look at the start of the season we thought isap was going to be in our teams all year there wasnt there wasnt any well there was there was a couple but use the cal expression there was very few managers who went without ea game week one and okay it was a great fixture against southampton at home but the general consensus was hes going to kick on this year and do well and its its been a combination of newcast not playing well the injury hes had but i love that talisman forward for a side and he plays west ham leicester and ipswitch in six games as well with brenford thrown in and palace who he should get chances against too i like it if youre selling harland in 12 or 13 i think eack is one of the best pi its just a differential that itll be and i can say west ham are probably the worst premier league side ive seen at the city ground in my time since weve been up i thought that was it was they were so bad i know they were down to 10 men but it wasnt wasnt a lack of theyve got good players dont get me wrong but just in terms of the way they were looking around the pitch completely lost no direction no identity it was so archetype a team that didnt believe in what they were being told to do or anything they were doing it was so obvious from just watching the game and forest were just like well this is dick this is just were playing around them and theyre not there was just no teamwork no spirit everything you dont associate with west ham they are gone unless they get rid of ly and all the talk is ive watched a lot of le i watched a lot of west ham stuff after the match because i like to see what they say and they were talking a lot about their own situation as youd expect and they were saying that they dont think sullivan will get opy out because of the nature of the how they got him was relationship with the agent and so on and if thats true if sullivan does drag his feet getting ly out because i have no doubt its not going to work i dont see him turning it round west ham have got to be put in the bracket that weve put the likes of itswitch and southampton in terms of thats a fixture we need to target no question could score two or three goals in that game well absolutely and you look at you look at some of the other teams you look at everton and theyve had spells this season where theyve looked all right theyre still a team that you wouldnt fancy any given week but theyve got players in the team who can like harrison like oneal like mcneil sorry like im not even gna say cal lin but betto up top theyve got players in there who can who can under dice you always feel like theyve got a system i think southampton been better last few games theyve been playing quite well big win against everton and played pretty decently against man city and spells too you look at ip switch i think theyve got something about them good manager everyones fighting for the cause i look at all the teams and i think theres positives i look at west ham and i struggle to find the positives in that side i look right through the team and think wheres the wheres the quality there is quality there kudos is out for another two games thats a blow bowen is an exceptional player its and p bowen and petta petas gone though hes hes gone honestly not hes offering nothing to that team but this is the problem right theyve got qu if you if you look at west hams three best players its bowen petta and kudos peta when hes committed but hes not now hes not but same its the same with kudos kudus is the same kudus is an unbelievably like talented player but i dont i wouldnt rely on him every week to put in a eight or nine out of 10 hes hes got an attitude hes got an attitude may be but i think ls got something to do with that lki took him off at halftime at brenford what was that i dont know what was going on so maybe there is off the pitch stuff im just saying west ham is a far easier game at the moment than perhaps people think based on i think w i think west ham at home if i was picking a player in a game i would want west ham at home at the moment for my player spirit wise there its not its gone theyre gone theyre gone they its such a shame its like because i want theyve got good players who could be useful to us but i thats why isak could be a real big differential game week 12 for sure no question at all thought we do predictions lets talk about our sponsors as yes so it is sleeper of course we mentioned them already the sleeper draft were playing fpl mate whos top of the league in that in our in our next game if youre watching or listening to this you cant get involved in that but what you can get involved in is the blackbox pick them game which you probably heard us talk about already essentially if you zap the qr code thats on your screen if you watch this on desktop or theres a link in the description it will take you to sleep app download it completely free enter into the blackbox pickham league and all youve got to do is pick the outcomes of all the games in the premier league and the person at the end of the month who has predicted the most correct outcomes wins a prize up to the value of 500 so weve given away an apple watch a ps5 and a google pixel i believe phone not were just taking them for ourselves ive got well but yes get involved i know were just were sle bags but get involved and like i said completely free to play youre supporting the stream if you get involved and hopefully you can win a great prize too so zap the qr code or use the link in the description oe sack i dont know if youre a west ham fan no quality have great players play absolutely i agree i think i think petta is not the player he was hes unquestionably an absolute quality player kud also i think amazing player bowen an amazing player they have got antonio is not what he was so theyre struggling up front and i dont think bowman can play there i totally agree theyre just not playing for the manager i dont i dont think i dont think theyve got a great team they got fabianski in goal with emerson starting juan basaka i dont thinks good enough for a for a the decent side hes not good enough if youre playing three at the back hes good enough if youre playing four at the back but hes playing three at the back and hes asking him to contribute up the field which he cant do as we know so wouldnt take any of them a brion all right maybe bow was i was shocked by how poor they were cuz i know theyre much better than that when i saw them anyway its getting harder to get this screenshot as this is the lead of order predictions but every week i seem to have to scroll down to find you i dont know whats going on so the tables getting small its getting smaller font every week as i try and make it long fing 54 im on now im see ive almost caught hot iron in terms of correct outcome percentage now hes on hes come down to 55 so fair enough youre fresh me on outcomes and score youre doing well this i think this is this has got to be the first time ive been below 50 because 50 is always our target isnt it if youre doing if youre at 50 youre doing all right and ive dropped below the magic 50 mark so i need to i need to get back on it you do indeed hard season to predict it is over 1100 watching weve only got 200 likes what would you say that was you say that was ridiculous as or what would you say that was i would say its ridiculous this and im saying if youre watching this and you havent and you havent liked the stream youre a ridiculous person so please do especially if youre a west h fan cuz i love you i just think its a shame im going to see west h brighton with fella over christmas i think its like the 20th of december like that and we got a 50 quid bet on on brighton finishing above west ham this season i think at the start of season i wouldnt have said it but i think i think youre going to get that now but i think west h will turn it around but not unless sullivan gets l out sadly right lets go for our predictions theres no theres no early kickoff saturday i dont like that i dont like no kickoff hate that it means the leaks could be more prominent couldnt it as well which i dont like god ian theres not exactly many there not i just i dont want all that dont want all that again brenford bournemouth defense straight away interesting youve got 21 brenford ive i think brenford are a good team at home and i think bourma for a poor team away from home so i thought this was i thought this was quite a sensible one buar struggling away from home i just dont think brenford defensively are good enough to keep them out and i do wonder whether frank has like i say mve the d a little bit in terms of what hes going to allow them to do in i hope hes learning his lesson and hes going to go back to the fun chaotic brunford of old so youve gone one two one way ive gone two one the other fair enough palace fulham difference of opinion here as well youve gone on the way win one nil fulham ive gone one all want to b i think its quite an even game i just think fmer are a better side than palace at the moment palace have got a lot of injuries with wton and e both outs again not sure when theyre when theyre back or if theyre coming back if theyre both out again then they got big problems so ill back for them winding their sales after their comeback and look at this difference again youve backed west ham youre going 21 west ham over ever ive gone 21 everton i just couldnt back everton i dont know i think i think at home i think this was just this was just done by the home fixture i think if everton had been at home id have gone for an everton win i dont think theres much in it between them but west ham maybe just to just to nick it and buy him a bit of time before the inevitable sacking in a month no question west ham and a better side and they have more quality on the pitch but i just i dont know i just think the fights not there and i think if everton get one up theyll go two up i think west h might pull one back so thats the narrative im going with set pieces i think as well everton will cause them problems because we certainly did they didnt look that secure and set pieces defending them so i think ever will win it probably have a couple of corners michael keane and tarkovski probably like that w s anon we both agree on the outcome youve gone 21 ive gone 31 kuna returns here we havent talked about kuna i just did an article about him on a sports casting where his stats are crazy i didnt realize well i didnt hey how many attacking returns he got last season he got 17 which is incredibly impressive he was averaging 47 points which is the same as bruno fernandez was last year i know i know we sag off bruno a bit still thats an elite player playing for a topish side compared to one playing for a struggling wolf side the chances created most chances created of all forwards i think its like the third most shots of all forwards as well ridiculous like that hes just doing everything you want you forward to be doing hes hes involved with i think hes going to get something out this game we talked about him didnt we last week in terms of his relationship with the bonus is good because of the chance hes created and plus wolves dont keep it clean sheets so score a goal or get any a turn and hes straight in the bonus plus hes on penalties they know hes going to be in that discussion when we do the next episode when were looking at forwards to replace harland which im sure we will be fixtures are still good so but this is the fixture to own him for isnt it i think he comes out of this with potentially double figure return and maybe ain norway gets that clean sheet but well see in man city youve gone 31 man city ive got ive given you a point you just dont fancy it what does chris say what does your dad reckon do what i dont even i dont even think i will stick with this when because we still got time to edit these i think its 31 either way do you hows that for sitting on the fence i worry a little bit that we go for blood against them and we just get like annihilated and caught and foden turns up and harland they score im sure they score no doubt about that its it could its going to be a good game and its talk about garden center game this is not the game you want to miss this weekend but then part of me thinks if we do go out and go for them and we could play them off the park and then if we score a goal early and we get in their heads maybe we do go on and win it fairly comfortably i dont know tricky one ive im going to b the pessimism its the easiest one to do is its your own team so ill back city but i wouldnt be surprised bri w this we got consensus on the 800 kickoff saturday its liverpool villa weve both gone 2 nil routine i think that looks it done it for me villa are just something it wrong the traveling is going to this is their third away game in a row having gone to spurs bru and now anfield that does take it out of you and they just seem flat dont they and i think liverpool had the european game as well but i just dont see them slipping up theyre not slipping up are they liverpool no i cant see anything other than a routine that i think villa will theyve got the potential to cause problems because they have good players but whos going to benefit i think they i think they can put a shackle on roders and i dont think theyll got caught up with balls over the top like maybe they used to do under klopp so watkins might struggle a little bit i think fairly routin united leicester you are all in on united here arent here 30 well theyve scored nine goals all season theyre going to get 30 of that in one game here against a koopa low block seriously and its the first time that that leicester wont score all season against man utd im bought into the amaron hype you are i think i think the players do what there was a lot of criticism about man utd against chelsea i thought they were all right i thought they did all right i think they did enough to win that game with some of the chances they i think chelsea were the better side overall but i think united created more opportunities in that match theyve won again tonight they should be beating leicester comfortably with the players theyve got so im going to back them to do it give rude his send off i enough and this is interesting forest newcastle its the only garden center game i could pick out of this lot because im not going to go chelsea arsenal although i do think in terms of spectacle chelsea arsenal will probably be pretty dull and the predictions weve gone weve backed that up youve gone three2 to forest ive gone one all three2 do what five goals in this you think chris wood hatrick he did it last year at st james he did he did and theres some players with some beef with newcastle weve got weve got chris wood got the hatrick at st jamess part last year we got alango who they were after and we didnt let go to newcastle they came in with 50m right at the death and we said no so alanga would want to play up and see if he can tempt them again in january and weve got aliot anderson who was let go and they didnt want to let him go good hes a fantastic player so weve got weve got three of our most important and influential players with something to play for here but newcastle will turn up with a bit of form i think itll be a very good game in terms of it being a tactical battle i dont know if thered be a lot of goals but you think is im very surprised very surprised youve gone 3 to i think one all is a much more realistic outcome and i think if you do need to get down that garden center this is probably the only game i would i would recommend i am going to this nice im probably going to have the worst journey ever because its ra replacement service those dreaded free words no so i dont know how im going to get home bigger fan than i am i cant i cant not go even if its on telly because of forest are just riding a crest of a wave arent they so ive got to go look at this agreement spurs it which this is not very often we go the same on a score line like this we both gone 40 which makes me think i need to be taking salanki captain more seriously than i am is if you trip triple up on the spurs and the salanki captain tempting isnt it but you just think theres no way here that they dont just fres it which right well realistically they shouldnt theyre a great team at home and weve shown the stats today spurs are the top attacking side in the league it switch to the bottom defensive team in the league so theres absolutely theres nothing to suggest that spurs wont wont win this they are when you watch them and when theyre in full song and sanki has been an unbelievable signing if you take fpl out of the equation what he gives to that team and the way he brings others into the in terms of pressing its no wonder that theyre so h because he presses high he links up the play well brings in the wingers who are effective especially with sbach now theyve got even more of a weapon on the left and i cant see any way up switch have any have anything to be able to deal with them so indeed daniel how the turns have tabled exactly its like only a couple of weeks ago we were like kalanki got to go is he but now i was saying this to sam earlier when johnson scored i sent a like pissy message to yell was like im so stupid i should have gone for johnson over sank im so annoyed with myself and all this and then how quickly things turn around and now we predicting 40 and im going to captain him so fpl is a funny game chelsea arsenal youve gone nil ive gone one nil i think arsenal will just grind this out i think this will be a set piece goal and then they just frustrate chelsea i do think clean sheets are coming back into the arsenal armory again and i think this will be the first one as a nonpma owner were probably both biased and this could be a three all draw with palmer all in but i just dont see it being that match nor do you by a look of it no i think arsenal can contain palmer when he starts and im sure he will its the game isnt it where like he just its the game which the chelsea arsenal and i think i think it said man utd chelsea was like the most nil nils in premier league history like that these bigger games i always go into it with a bit of an expectation that its going to be a bit of a ball fest and arsenal liverpool was the exception because that was two and there was lots of goals in that but i think this is going to be a nil or a one nil eitherway thought you say so matt and fy fimy joyd are both doubting the spurs clean sheet but i refer the honorable gentleman to the attacking data which it switch a 086 xg non penalty per 90 that is incredibly poor so yes theyve got the lap but i think whats the whats the lap in terms of goal involvement have we got that on here we havent but i think his goaling go is something like 70 so you stop dap it which dont score and dap could score for them and that could be a factor but i think the logic behind the spurs clean sheet isnt the robustness of the spurs defense its the powder puffiness of the it switch attack right well the one weapon it switch do have is leaf davis from corner and youre benching im benching him but if theyre going to score if ifs swi score i bet its from a corner from a leaf davis corner well vicario and the spurs defense are all over the shop arent they for those god theyre so bad set pieces they so they saw it from against villa just viaro just doesnt know how to how to claim him hes hes a great keeper otherwise but he struggles in that area okay thats our predictions lets have a look briefly at the captaincy its a tough one isnt it because theres a theres a real spread because were going to have the harland owners were going to have the salah owners and then were going to have those who are going to go off the wall and go maybe a salanki or even an mumo maybe and its lovely to see i sit here now and think theres going to be a real when i when i check peoples teams like i do 1100 or whatever on saturday i will see a spread of captains across all those that i look at i think its this is exactly what we wanted what were going to have we perhaps further on i think so i think i think well see harland i think well see salah do you think itll be majority salah do you i think youll see all salas i think its going to be salah sal it does make me wonder bruno of course mentioned in chat there on matt does make me wonder whether i should go against that and go harland or even salanki because theres no question that those three players could lets have a look at robs graphic because i think that could tell us a bit more rob t at robt fbl do follow because he does some excellent stuff and this is just a sample this is showing the spread betting expected goals and expected clean sheets odds expected goals top of this is spurs to 290 then its united 245 liverpool 235 city are out at 205 so not in the top three in terms of surprised its that way around for liverpool city i thought given its villa and there are top sixish side and the fact that we going to conc h of a lot of chances more than likely i thought that would be the other way around but interesting does that make you think that that cements salah but it also says salan is the tilt right i just i sometimes i just feel that we do these podcasts we look at all these data we look at all these stats we spend however many hours a week looking at stats and drilling down and we have evidence to say that weve got the best attacking team in the league versus the worst defensive team in the league with a player whos just scored 16 points scored again in the europa league tonight clearly okay i dont know clearly now got something about him wind in his sales weve got salah with a fairly trick which could be a fairly tricky i think he still returns but it could be a fairly tricky game for him we got har bang off form im going for sanki i am very tempted because i think youre right its like how often do we have the worst attack against the worst defense with the with the confidence that way the only thing that makes me concerned is you look at the spurs attack and it could come from anywhere it could come from brennan it could come from son it could be kesi it could be madison madison will surely play this game so what i do know is that spurs wont let up it wont it you look at city and liverpool if they go 2n up you wouldnt say theyre going to run up 45 nil if spurs go twonil up it could easily be 4 five because an wont stop hell keep coming ratons injured y so did salanki start tonight i was be very no it came off lank started and got sent off okay so charltons injury for me that made me more interested in sank because i dont see sank getting subbed because who comes on and plays that central role and if anything think sons going to get subbed because hes back from injury johnson might get subbed mickey moore might come on the right hes as well is he right so johnsons probably 90 minutes as well then okay johnsons a fun one hes on this list as at list as well we know ipswitch are weaker down that side isnt the leaf davis side its ben johnson isnt it i think hes been playing for ip switch i wouldnt trust johnson then again i wouldnt trust its a funny one isnt it is brennan against leaf davis is because brennans right side up against the left side okay then i i fav that less then so its well its son up against ben johnson then if i if i if i had son id be very tempted or if i even if i didnt have son i had a route to get him id be very tempted by that the flip side his leaf davus does get forward and so brennan could get behind him i think he beats him for pace brennan i weve both predicted 40 so youve got to think that even if sanki doesnt come out as a top scorer here hes going to get a return son is the player to go for with the penalties as well im im i am now depending on what videos i watch on friday night im gonna go salanki so if i watch if i watch anything on salanki or spurs or ab adct which i probably will go that way if you see a video of do slon with a sausage dog thats going to be it isnt it i know thats all hes got to do thats all hes got to do im so im so open to persuasion on this one thats for sure if not ill just play safe with s but its its lovely to have a tt isnt it because thats a big tilt on your part for four with well lets have a look at our teams for it as ry in goal im envious ray is ray is in goal al its not i hope that nil comes through your one nil prediction but a little bit une easy its raya trent gabrielle and moreno as the defensive four its foden for one more week before i move over to palmer because ive got the money which ill talk about in a sec its inmo its garnacho little bit worried now seeing as amad has come on and scored two goals in the europa league rogers hes got the yellow flag but he played in the champion so hes going to be fine and its harand slanky captain and i did watkins out for kuna you got kuna thats nice thats nice i do like that team i like it i gu rogers g at foden theyre its a its a its a team which has potential to do because if sanki blanks and salah goes off and fens a bit of a gam im playing rogers against trend ive got double arsenal defense if chelsea score i dont know its its a team which i its not ide like im seeing sams wild card team for example im thinking god it looks strong with salah saaka and palmer all in there but then palmer and saaka playing each other i know im im im happy to own kuna though the plan was always to get to get kuna i was going to do harland and dibling out for salah and kuna but then i wouldnt have had the money to get palmer right so you can go palmer in what can you go palmer in one move next so i can do f to palo next week for so youre not going to go s at all no youre going to hold harland and not go salah well harand might be coming in for i might be doing harand to salah in 13 when they play each other but it will be holland over salah for the next two salahs got southampton game at 12 but hollands got spurs at home id expect him to do something in that and im cting palmer anyway against leicester so salo liverpool high press against s an i know there but then if i go for if i go for salah then im not gonna have palmer so theres theres always goingon to be someone that im gonna be id rather have salah at santon than palmer at leicester well i cant afford so i cant afford s in one move so its gonna have to be palmer i do have another free transfer though to use i dont want to play rogers away i am i but what you think so well i was i was thinking of maybe moving for a united defender and bringing in mazari or do maybe even for lewis because if im not playing lewis this game im not playing him against spurs and then im not playing him against liverpool when im when am i going to play him what about 8 nori says fb forest eight nor is fine but theyre not theyre not keeping clean sheets and i dont think hes gonna go i know but i dont think hes going to go on and get 20 attacking returns i could i could i could do lewis to i could do i could do lewis to someone i dont know but i quite like the idea of just saving the transfer cuz theres theres not many clean sheets around anyway rogers could get something against liverpool at least ive got some stake in the game if trent loses clean sheet so as im a little bit tempted by lewis to to mazra or d a little bit a little bit tempted m agre i like that one i dont leicester to score old trafford seems remote to me i just think cooper is going to low block there wont be much ambition i i think del could go on as well but if amam does come in and change the system and del playing wing back i think he could be a strong option so theres a py that wants to do it im im not i dont know im 5050 see how i feel comment of the night nooski as your team is not good i see 40 points perfect cheers nooski is there a prize for comment of the night we should have that if sank gets a couple of goals and foden and foden turns up its not going to be a midlin result this its going to be either absolute disastrous cuz i can see chelsea scoring i can see newcastle scoring i can see villa scoring i strangely i think trent is your best bet for a clean sheet i can see foden getting an hour and dea getting half an hour and foden coming off i can see salanki should be right i can see gacha and rogers blanking kuna should be right you do maybe it is a middling team maybe its not foden harand slanky kuna that theres those four theyre going to with this team this week i tell you what though i think i can catch you this week but it isnt going to be down to fleen fle thats thats your old team so thats a good start thats my is it thats your thats your old team sal against brighton slanky against god it is whats going on here let me i dont in that case and i dont think ive got my team let me try what am i goingon to do now then let me see if i can grab my team youll have to keep talking while i try and do this show cant even show the right i thought i thought i grabbed my team thats odd i dont know how i can do this now can you can you go back to my team then i can just talk through that a bit more sorry about that i thought id got that right but clearly not do what i knew i knew that this team was going to get slated by people this week because its got players in it that not a lot of people have got but ive seen enough from har and foden to think theyre both still good options like i said i think theyre going to were going to concede chances to them if gacho plays hes playing leicester i still think hes a good pick should have got more in that in that game slanky captains fun is a good option rogers is the weakest link in this side this week which is why is tempting to move to a dow or a or a mazari mazra the reason why i keep mentioning mazari by the way is not because i think hes a better option than dow its just the money masro is 45 i think dow is 51 theres a point 6 difference between them and if i am going to be looking to get sacker in the future like that im probably going to need that money the one thing is when it comes to gw 13 and i move harland out i might also be tempted to move trent out as well and thats going to free up a lot of money so that tempts me into just going for do because i think in a few weeks i might have some more money in the bank any i cant grab my team because i forgotten what the screenshot im on a mac and i dont know what the screenshot button is and its too complex to do so were just gonna have to just gonna have to talk through my team im afraid so sorry about this great if youre on the podcast not great if youre on the stream unless anyone knows what the screenshot button is on the on the mac but i dont use the mac often enough to know im sure therell be some this why i hate max always something ridiculous isnt it and then i cant i cant get the bloody bench in either because its too its the wrong format im trying just bear with me and i do this hold on three times and do a forward roll and thatll get you a something weird apple up three everyones saying different things i know ive got it command shift three now i dont know how to get it into the stream let me just see if this works let me just go on i dont know how this happen i love that everyones posting different commands for a screenshot no ones put the same one twice no i cant do it i cant do its no good cant do it right so my team is i just have to talk for it sorry for people on the on the stream its youre going so well mark until you got i know it was going well so my team is just for the podcast and for people listening it is gna be god this is a disaster it is fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis mumo johnson salah ameno harland and salanki so ive benching rogers at the moment do i play lewis or do i play rogers thats the question i think they both get one to two points so i think you probably play the attacker you did it there we go but im dragging it into the wrong screen if anyone would like a little bit of a window into to what its like doing these with mark this is its i cant do its all broken no two minutes later ive done it ive this is you every week every week its blurry though its not good quality but its the best i could do so fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis in johnson salah captain seeno maren salanki do i play rogers over lewis and do i captain salanki are the two questions im not going to make a transfer because i need to save the two for gw 12 with the palmer question in mind i am i think i think you i think you play rogers i think you play the its its its 5050 between i think you go you go for the city can seeed again dont they thats the thing its its just i dont back villa to score either so its not like no but whats more likely villa score or city dont concede i dont know thats close liverpool are the best defensive side and i dont think vill in great shape and not only a villa got a score but rogers has got to have something to do with it whereas i think its sorry i city could get your clean sheet but then lewis may not get may not start or may not even get the hour needed to get the clean sheet as well thats the other thing he could be subbed at half time now pep so they havent got the fit squad though you got to think lis will start but i just its easier to score a goal than it is to keep a clean j for 90 minutes thats very true and brighton will probably score maybe it is better to go with the attacking player again im open to persuasion friday night to see what happens but i think i think youre right i probably will go on the attack i do like the salanki captain cuz ive got harand and salah covered so therefore the damage that they can do in terms of if they haul is minimized by the fact i own them both whereas going salanki is a big differential and if he did come in with another double figure that would be a big swing in my favor i think this i think you could overtake me this week because theres not a lot wrong here is there are the trip i think poo could easily get a double figure if he gets sp if spurs win that 40 and porro and johnson both get returns ive got you ive got youre in my sights well see the rivalry this is the deciding season as well isnt it not its going to be that last one but its two all so this is no this is it no whoever wins this black box finishes at the end of this season so youve had enough youve had enough of the tantrums and the technical problems enough of the tantrums enough of bloody people in the chat having a go at me about barco its over i saw that was that was there some serious barco backlash i know people been a bit dick in the in the chat tonight so ive given a few people a timeout so they can think about what theyve done okay all right i dont i dont know why people have to bring barco up when was i it wasnt it wasnt about barco put you on a timeout next time you exactly so its all to play for isnt it i do think this is what i said a few weeks back its much more enjoyable season were not doing brilliantly and not many content creators are its a rarity that you see a content creator flying this season but i dont think many content creators will say that its not a better season as in terms of whats on offer from the game right i love it i think its great and i like the fact people look at my team and think its its crap because i look at it and think theres potential there with foden and and kuna and sanki captain and everyones team is going to be different and everyone is going to be biased to think that players they havent got in their team arent as good because thats why weve picked the players that weve got and not gone for the for the other ones so its fascinating theres going to be people and in a few weeks theres going to be people with teams without sacka and then people are going to say why is your team got sacka and its like because ive got palmer and sah and harand and its its its interesting at the moment were seeing like certain premium players dropping in form and things its going be when weve got if we get if we get to a point where weve got son saaka palmer harland and salah all delivering points and then you got hts and eak as well that and watkins maybe its its amazing itll be a great state of affairs i think the defenders not keeping clean sheets has changed things as well because were flashing money out and the four five aint nor is suddenly a hot property which i love it i love that as well its great weve got one super chat from at boy to address before we go thank you for the six year that boy and for your youre always there in chat thank you for all your support you always a support of the show great showers do you avoid starting a defender that plays one of your attackers i own vardy and have to have to start ana or maz rui so vardy is at united does he start maz ri a think you have to dont you i know what hes saying there dont you an i love i do think we could concede theres a theres a world in which we win one nil for sure cuz newcastle arent scoring a lot of goals and we are very strong defensively and it could be one of those games where one goal decides it so ana might not be a bad bet at all its not a bad choice to go ana but i do think united clean sheet against leicester is probably the most likely outcome dont you as i love that question because thats exactly what i asked you earlier is how much has that impact on it and ideally youd play mazari and not think twice about it because its a home game you didnt have v but then youve got vardy and youre thinking well i want vardy to score and then if he does score i dont want to be annoyed when mazari l his sheet i think it would it depends on my belly for a risk wouldnt it if where i am now i probably would go vard and ana and go because or you bench or you bench vardy and play mazari and ana i maybe think about that i i dont think but thens got penalties isnt he thats the thing i just dont know like they will low block and they will counter and vardy has got that turner pace and you maybe united go there go high line and vard i think id play i think id play vardy and mrai because i think theres all i think either way youre going to either get points from vardy or mazwi because if ler score itll be through vardy and if they dont the mai score so i think i i think id lean towards that but close good one at booy very good question which chimed with what we talked about tonight good show as thank you for that thank you for the 1200 still watching and all the support tonight wow amazing and i think this is my favorite season for three or four years i think possibly right up there with one of my favorites so far i hope it stays on this vein and i hope our teams remain aart not just our teams but everyone out there as well and its just a much more enjoyable season for it so looking forward to what this week brings i go into every game week thinking this could be one extreme or the other whereas last season it was like itll be another small red or small green whereas now it could be a big red or a big green or something extreme like that and me and you are tussling for the ranks now so i know im glad youve closed the gap makes it more interesting thats the thing i spent so long last season like even at like 3m in the first 10 weeks i was like 32m 29m 34m and like that like its im exactly the same rank as what i was like four weeks ago but its been like 800k 14m 500k yes i its been its been a lot more its been a lot more interesting and i think it when you see a player like sank gets 16 points and you look at your rank and you see the impact its had and its like wow hes not that highly owned because people have put so much money into salah and haren they cant afford salanki you got good managers without players like salanki because they cant theyve gone a different route which is also completely viable and well pay off in different weeks but every strategy is going to have its time to shine and its comms in which one was the one which will be which was the correct one bring it on bring on another game week maybe r it maybe green but well enjoy it anyway hopefully we keep saying that throughout the season thank you again for everyone who joined in tonight well see you soon hit the like if you enjoyed it hit the subscribe if youre new around here let me just let me just put that up look ive got the animation ive hard to use it there it is there we go look at that beautiful no beautiful and well see you well see you after the break it might be the second week before we go into game week
