hello and welcome to another scoutcast brought to you by fantasy football scout as always you are joined by me andy fpl mode no do what im not going to go to you first im going to go to callum first nacho nao hows it going my man yeah im doing well mate i always feel a little bit indifferent about international breaks but its been an okay start but im happy to have a week off now and its quite nice actually for this stre just to take a little bit of a seat back talk about hibo team of course and then just refresh on whats happened in the first three game weeks i was going to try and skip over it i was going to try and skip over it nao obviously lovely to have you on weve got to obviously look at the elephant thats in the room and his names hibo how was your week very good very good had a nice had a nice relaxing week in holiday we spent the time in center parks in longford yeah and apart from that nothing really strange happened well scored 110 points in fantasy my obscene crazy game we rank i think was 1486 and its its funny you because ive never seen you smile this on stream before no that scored the weekend was its basically what fantasy is all about isnt it and its the thing that youll remember maybe in 5 years time or 10 years time because i look at last season and last season i finished i think go overall about 90k but i looked at my overall rank and how i progressed throughout the season and it took me until about game week 18 until i broke under the top million yeah so this start is obviously very different but no the stars can of seem the lan my transfer last week was in kungu to brian buo had they move there was there was a couple of factors that i had to have 5m in the bank which i did i started i said with him in such a way to have that i had to move early on the sunday because inu was going to drop so and then there was a about a factor in that was tony going to move from branford so it was there was there was a couple of different factors in play here and i just took the leap because i thought southamptons a good fixture two difficult fixtures coming up now hes away to man city and hes away to spurs he is and i cant and i thought to myself ill take the risk and southampton being the money game and ill go for it and maybe hell be very good short term but after gw six i think hes a player that everybodys going to want their team so i thought it might defer the wiard but for me so no the transfer him was good and i think everything else went to plan ive just got this not to be morbid but ive got this image of you on your deathbed and youre looking back through all your amazing things in life and its getting married kids and then the 110 just flashes up and thats when you smile thats what day yeah exactly thats there it is thats what i wanted so we this is a bit of a different scoutcast tonight so we are in the international break were not going to be going through what we normally go through so were not going to be looking at all of our points were not going to be looking at all of our bus teams were not going to be looking at all of our normal stats and things that because were going to be doing all of that next week gearing up for the next game week what we really wanted to look at tonight was wild cards now yes were going to be looking at the wild cards weve each made a different wild card for you tonight so if youre on wild card this is brilliant for you if youre not on wild card this is still going to be a really good stream for you because you can see what were aiming for with wild card so you can see how many moves it takes for you to get there you can also see whether you want to wild card now you want to wild card later whatever it is you want to do there will be really useful information here especially considering were going to be thinking about all those players going into a wild card so it could be informing your transfers moving forward as well but before we look at wild cards oh and by the way there will be a bit of a qa at the end but wild card specific before look at that though weve spoken about it already and weve got to get it out weve got to get the money shot out before we look at the wild cards havent we and hibo this is your team from this week theres just returns everywhere and look at his smile look at him hes a little hes in a sweet shop isnt he just talk us through the points because some people might never have a week this so just talk us through your points from this week cuz it is just delectable yeah ill go back front for the benefit of the podcast listeners so at henderson and goal no clean sheet but six saves happy enough for that actually anony robinson he got his second assist of the season hes ticking along nicely were happy with him tran got the clean sheet could have scored he had the goal that was the goal lan technology it was given and then obviously salah was maybe half a yard off cona blank no good salah 17p pointer the 14 points from brian bumo as a 10pointer was a lovely goal against chelsea actually smith r blink he really let the side down in midfield and then up front with j pedro i really enjoyed the j pedro goal because he busted the arsenal clean so i didnt have any arsenal i dont have any arsenal players because we spoke on preseason about shortterm or over the first five i was making a bet against arsenal so there was a about a luck on it obviously because dean rice got the second yellow card get sent off the game turned its head but arsenal m chances but pedro scored and hes looking a great byy and i think loads of people are going to start picking him up now h just seems to score hck every week and then isaac he obviously scored for newcastle so no i went down the hen salah route with my team and theres obviously been an over performance everybody on twitters talking about these returns are unsustainable and of course theyre unsustainable the both scored 41 points i think yeah over the first three game weeks ive had it lovely but i read a lot of stuff on twitter im preseason and then even at the weekend once this teams effectively done the points and people were saying some people were saying this team wasnt ever really viable and i obviously dont agree because if you look at my team my teams actually fairly close to i suppose some versions of the analytics template now the only difference is that i think that might have the some of those teams are i had salah smith row and five and or5 million in the bank compared to saka and bruno fernandez so that was really my bet was it did i think salah and a cheap midfielder could out run those two players over the first five weeks and it couldnt have gone any better so no good start very happy still roughly plannned the well card in game week yeah and my teams i feel my teams very well its obvious if your team goes and scores 110 points everybody wants to buy those players so i think now in international break i can relax myself a bit because normally were looking at price changes and were thinking no we have to sell this player before he drops and none of that im just g to switch off
