welcome back for another video were in an international break which is often a popular wild card window as you got a couple of weeks to tiny of your team and you can react to if theres any injuries or price changes over the break as well so ive put together a wild card team and an opportunity to talk about what might be the best team right now question is when should you actually wild card i wouldnt do it purely because youve started slowly if youre happy with your team the wild card is the most powerful chip and it should be used if youve got some picks that have gone wrong some injuries perhaps and perhaps some unfavorable fixtures gamei 6 is the next walker window that i after this week and thats when i might use mine so lets get into the team and perhaps controversially in goal its henderson but hear me out on this one he has been a disappointment but if you actually step back and compare all the 45 mil keepers sals has faed best of 11 points for forest but thats literally only four more points than henderson palace come back from the break of a home fixture against leicester and then its home to man united again and then away to everon the 45 mil keepers have always been unpredictable for me and in honesty any of them could come out on top fleing as well brenford come back from the break with two horrendous fixtures theyre against man city and spurs but the keeper always longterm picks and after that theyre home to west ham and walls somehow if those were the first two fixures after the break and then two difficult ones i feel itd be a more popular wild card pick even though its the same fixtures in a different order if you get what when i make a transfer im looking at the next four or five game weeks but goalkeepers are potentially for the next 10 to 15 or maybe even longer until your second wild card moving on to the defense which is robertson coner and dunk i cant help but wonder if robertson and a 1 mil saving is better than going for tren for 7 mil both are super attacking theyre taking some corners and some set pieces now trents underly numbers have been better in the opening three robinson has come close to hauling himself robinsons created five chances to trent seven 18 crosses to trent 12 two shots to trent three its all about the combinations though where that one mill goes essentially robertson and e is better than going trenton a 59 midfielder in my eyes or robertson and gabriel over trent and a 5 mil defender they can definitely make the case for going with a double up on the wild card given that they do have forest bournemouth walls and palace as their next four im curious what slots plan is when the champions league starts though does he use bradley in the champions league or could bradley get sniff and right back in the league if trents playing in europe as well a brighton defenders are nob brainer given theyve got two home games to i switch and forest next now if we knew that c ugly was a guaranteed starter hed be so obvious whenever he breaks in hes got potential to be an absolute beast it could even be after the break if you want to take the chance the 24 year old can play almost anywhere hell be most likely a left wing back or right wing back in brighton system but he can be used the midfield hes got 30 goals 39 assists in his career and he was impressive at the euros that all considered ive gone for dun here as uss the nailed rout into brightons defense with a bit of threat on set pieces still and lastly cona the other 45 mil defender and he also comes back from the break of two home fixtures against everton and woles and then hes got it switch away dunk fixtures get a bit tricky in a few weeks time which is where the bench comes in later liverpool a joint top on the clean sheet odds after the break given a 47 chance along with city brighton a third of 445 and aston villa fourth of 42 its going to be a similar story in gami 5 as well i decided to leave rico lewis out hes been so good for city but i just dont trust him to start every game in fact the other day pep said quote but everythingin three days he cannot sustain that we need ky walker back we need stones back and all the players ready because of the schedule that comes now until the end of the season preseason is officially over the real season starts after the international break obviously pep could just use lewis in every league game and walker in the champions league but its completely obvious lewis wont play every match onto the midfield which is seeno salah e m and palmer now theres just no way im going without salah with those fixures on a wild card amazingly despite all the harlem versus salah debates theyre both on exactly the same points with 41 each harlands the high round of the two so if you do have both then salahs the upside captain in game for as i do expect harand to be the most captain player once again and it just goes to show by the way how it is a bit easier for midfielders harlands on backto back hat tricks and yet salah tied of him with three goals three assists harlands on seven returns and all seven to goals the extra point per goal and the clean sheet points add up for midfielders everyones talking about how good harlands been but the other side of the coin is harlands having to score consecutive hat tricks to keep pace with salah sano is a bit of a rogue pick but ive been really impressed by him last season he started in 25 of 38 games and he was often an impact sub and often brought up early when he did start this season hes played 90 minutes every game he started all three with three returns in three games he seems to be very overlooked and dont get me wrong liverpool and arsenal in his next five isnt ideal but hes a cheap lowrisk pick and check this out as well after three game weeks hes fourth among all players who expected goal involvement harand salah and de bruyne are the only three players ahead of him and plus seenos got southampton and leicester in his next four so what a not the other budget mid ive included is m hes been an absolute menace hes carried his preseason form into the season hes got two assists so far but i can see him doing very well in the next couple of fixtures matom is the other one that i really if you can find that 1 mil for the upgrade hes even better pick the m on a side note theres no arsenal in the starting 11 i do have one on the bench though their run of fixes from game six is unmissable so make sure youve got planned for it so if i was lining up with this team the plan would be to roll and then look to bring in sacka for either salah or palmer in gamei six and optionally buying bumo for one of the five and a half men with fielders probably m so realistically i think the player would be salah to saka and then m to inuma in gamei six so palmer the other premium midfielders with a decent block of green fixtures hes got bournemouth west ham brighton and forest theres a lot you can do if only going two premiums no palmer doesnt allow you to have the trenton robertson double up and you cant own in boomer in advance just bench him this week etc i did think about it but my preferred route is going salah palmer and harland and then make that salah to sacka switch in game six which freeze up loads of money if youre on the wild card which premiums would you have and last midfielder is e who thankfully repaid the patience of those that held him last game e otherwise he would have been a more difficult one to justify on that note actually i still think fernandez is a very good wild cut pick whos likely going to be 83 more by the next deadline so you could sell him if youve got him and then buy him back in if youre on a wild card hes against southampton as well e is one return against leicester away from returning back to his starting price i reckon over the opening three game mi seenos actually taken the most shots of any player of seven and then e second with 15 then harland with 14 by the way how absurd is seven goals from 14 shots from harland absolutely not sustainable but lets move on to the front two as is harand and xiao pedro harand gets the armband for the brenford fixture so its a thre mum draft and despite arsenal and newcastle his next three i would have him on the wild card you can definitely make the case with gal i have seen lots of wild card drafts with no harlem but i just think given lots of great budget picks available simo m and xia pedro and the 4 five more defenders actually then it is feasible to have har and salah and palmer and as i say id switch salah to sack in game six which freeze up about 25 mil the beauty of har and the salah is you can captain salah against bournemouth in gamei 5 and then in gamei six youve got a choice between salah palmer or even sack if you bring him in he could even captain har against newcastle way still i prefer ja pred to welbeck as his minutes have been superior and when well becks come off early hes been pushing into the number nine roll so i see absolutely no reason to go without him for five points 7 mil and he hasnt been called up for the international duty for brazil either so hell be well rested ahead of that i switch fixture v is a good shout as well for 61 mil but he does have those two difficult games to man city and spurs before west ham and wolves i think visan and boomer both great picks now with no tur in the picture those are the two players that their goals are going to come from one strategy ive seen on the wild card which i do is going in buma and xiao pedro in combination as their fixures rotate perfectly though as we saw xia pedro can score against an arsenal though of course they were against 10 men the alternative to xiao pedro and aumo is going min or moma and then vissa and then you bench vissa and rotate them i much prefer going aumo and xiao pedro though on the bench its turner gabrielle moscara igo so ive got about 2 mil on the bank here you might have more you might have less depending on how youve managed with the prize changers so far so the plan is to bench gabriel for the next two game weeks and then hes a set forget starter from game we six now theres so many four mill defenders theres grieves stevens mcera howard bellis benner at keen ive gone for mcara here who has played every minute so far and the other reason being in game s when conants got man united and dunk got spurs there is the option to play mcara whos got brenford alongside robertson and gabriel on the starting 11 you could alternatively go for fast or vestard who are home to bournemouth that week instead so thats the wild card let me know what you think and if you enjoyed the video make sure youre subscribing and the video thanks for watching and
