welcome back for another video time to get back into the swing of fpl with a deadline around the corner at last so lets catch up with what the experts are doing this week with data from hundreds of top managers if youre not a channel subscriber this is the one series you cannot miss each week so make sure youre subscribed im off to get the focal logo tattooed as promised for 200000 subscribers as well right after this video wish me luck lets kick off with the manager highlight then marons moved top of the league with a huge score of 92 points which takes him up to 34k overall amazing rank this early in the season the average score in the experts league was 78 points 14 above the global average its quite a good barometer to show how well they play when their average score is consistently well above the overall average flare play has got the highest score of 97 points onto trifer activity and this week 33 are going to roll the transfer 24 making one transfer 25 making two and 7 making three transfers for a minus four hereit and this week 11 have got a chip active and weve got a wild card team for one of the experts to look at later in this video so a ton of transfer activity this week who are the most popular players theyre buying and selling the most transferred in player this week is salah who 39 have picked up not surprising at all given how well he started plus hes got two home fixes ahead to forest and bournemouth but just how well has he started until this season the most points hed had off three game weeks was 30 points in the 20192 season and 2122 season hes 11 clear of that currently with 41 so whos being sacrificed to fund him well its sack who 27 of the experts have sold unless youve got 2 and a half mil or so lying around then you do need the extra funds as well which is why were seeing so many making two or three moves isa to xia pedro is how many of them are funding it i mentioned in the team selection video that sacka did very well against spurs last season he got one go one assist in the home and away games of course after that arsenal do have man city and theyre going to be about rice and igard against spurs theyll be about erard against city so how much of a loss is erard to arsenal with erard and the team theyve won 664 of games without him 526 21 goals per game with him 16 goals per game without a slight drop off in shot frequency as well before the season kicked off harand was their favorite premium we have seen countless times over the years where at the end of an era comes at a club and the team takes time to adapt to a new manager maybe even culture arsenal and man united two good examples but liverpool hit the ground running under slot three wins in three clean sheets in three 71 expected goals as well 71 for man city so theyre practically even at this point 31 of b sha pedro then who has hit the ground running as well with two goals in three games and hes home to ip switch next he did travel with brazil over the international break getting a very late call up he only played 45 minutes in total though so the hope for owners is his minutes will be unaffected 16 have bought e and 16 have bought robertson its an ideal entry point to buy e with a home fixure to leicester same applies to robertson palace will then have another home game to man united and then everton away its been quite a few years but the robertson and trent double up at the back does look strong again both have played very well and both look capable of attacking returns any game right now 5 of solding kungu and some buying rogers who is another way to thr up that sell of money if you need it if not for a couple of big chances missed by walkins thered be no debate what immense value he can be 4 have cut their losses on quant as well it wouldnt be surprising if he gets some starts in the coming weeks with champions league back but his starts do look unpredictable and you wouldnt feel comfortable starting the many game week unless theres a leak which is also possible just 5 of op for wellbe of xia pedro who could get more minutes this week given the ls international call up and lots of traveling though an only trend weve seen in the last couple of games is well backck comes off a bit early and jaia pedro pushes up top when they both start he plays a bit deeper with welbeck up top welbecks best ever goal scoring season in his 16 year premier league history he nine goals with sh pedro matched last season orll be lots of pens in there both look like great picks for the next two gamic though its still a unclear who the best for defender is my pick in preseason was greaves who 7 have picked up this week vip switchs features turning nicely now nailed on at center back moscara is a great shout as well when wolves get into an easier period though he did pick up a knock over the break just dont plan to start any of the formal defenders if he can help it theyre four mil for a reason im interested to know everyones thoughts on lewis my gut feeling is he could become a frustrating pick in the coming weeks when the schedule gets busier 10 have picked him up though but is he going to start every week youd be surprised of walker waiting for his first minutes of the season still hes undoubtedly been brilliant though and a very reasonable pick if hes got sufficient bench cover hes someone that you need in a backline with three or four other playable defenders ideally so hows the chip landscape looking then 11 of got their wild cut active this week which means about 79 has still got theirs the next wild cut window that i think will be a popular one is gamix 6 which is the ideal time to load up an arsenal assets in the likes of mumo and harland if you dont have them fodens back in training as well could be a crazy differential soon forza inter has got his wild cut active this week and he shared his team which is rya fabianski dunk davis moscara trent lewis rogers e m lis diaz salah jeia pedro harland and jackson heres what you had to say building a wild card for gamei 4 was quite a tricky endeavor and with hindsight may have been a slight of reaction on my part to having strong gamei 1 and two but a below aage gamic 3 nevertheless with this wild card i addressed a number of structural and key personnel issues within my team and i hope ill yield some reasonable games not only over the next two game weeks but also against those managers planning to walk on gamix six this means that ive may be playing the most conservative wild cut ever but it still feels very satisfying kn that i have a revamped squad like many managers i imagine i found myself needing to shift my gami 4 squad towards the likes of liverpool brighton and others but due to highspeed car crashes named sank in gami 1 and murphy in gami 2 i now lack the fre transfers needed to bring in the likes of salah trent ja pedro m etc more patient more skilled lesser rational fpo managers may be able to steer their newcastle and arsenal laden teams towards karma waters without deploying the wild card life bone but clearly im not as patient as skilled or as rational as they are triple liverpool feels right salah trener diaz and my pool boys the plan is for salah and diaz to become sackin and bumo in gamei six but i plan to keep training my team for the long haul as he offers ridiculously good value for 7 mil trent is kept companied by a bunch of budget defenders so that can load more money into the front a i will however keep faith and rya as this price means i have exposure to the leagues best defense for 5 a half million davis duncan lewis leou is minut risk i know all have attack and return potential and decent fixture blocks dunc might become a nal defender in a couple of weeks and mcare could be grieved and stared but i prefer not to double up on a promoted size defend plus wolves have a decent fixture r somewhere down the road beyond salar and deaz a and rogers are longterm midfielder glue picks and ive taken the advice of many content creators by trying to make rogers my eighth rather than seventh attacker along with rogers mente will shuffle in and out of my starting 11 depending on fixtures up front har and shia pedro both feel like safe responsible picks but nicholas jacksons clearly a more risky wild card pun ive never owned him my expectations arent skyh high but something gutty tells me hes capable of delivering a few surprises and hes clearly a differential pick right now my gamic for wild card with no less than three planned transfers in the weeks ahead what could go possibly wrong thanks for sharing and best of luck with the wild card moving on to experts captaincy and its just two names this week unsurprisingly harland and salah 82 of captain in harland 18 captain and sah it is hard to separate the two given they both have home fixures and both have equal points after three game weeks the any time goal scor probabilities have harland ahead on a 56 chance of scoring any time as sal on 43 and a half watkins isnt third but hes not been seen in training yet which is something to keep an eye on if youve got him emry should give us an update in his press conference before the deadline jaia pedro notably on 35 this week as far as the gami projections with everything factored in harlands top on 84 points on fp review and then salah on 78 es third on 62 let us know in the comments of your captain is this week onto the experts team for gamei four and theres been a few changes to the team its henderson in goal its trent conon robinson in defense in midfield its roger salah e jotter and smith row and its harland and xia pedro up top so its harand captain and salah vice salah xia pedra and coner join the team in place of saaka hall and isak 11 home fishes this week looking very good this week valder marson mun porro and barker on the bench smith r mun is a bit of a tossup but weve got smith r starting here the experts ownership percentages are from last week as always but isach was the most known player last week in 88 of teams but given the mass sales and keeping the team of in budget shia pedra replaces him if there was ever a week for the team to knock out the park this has got to be it that said we know how much of a fpl can be at times mun is probably going to score a hattick on the bench and henderson scores an own goal moving on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gamei 4 heres what they to say very messi is not convinced by selling isak he says holding my wild card until the november international break unless theres a rash of injuries brysons fixures are too scary to bring in pedro isaks form seems fine and no reason to doubt him ash patel took comm maners for to sell sacka and kungu and isak for salah rogers and welbeck and he says i went early on sal in the international break cuz inu was bleeding value i usually only take one or two hits in a season but i felt the need to get salarin and droing kungu quickly so three tres w necessary we only two in hand im hoping it pays off but having to get rid of sack and ea could well come back to haunt me the football chatter was another expert of his wild cut active and he shared his thoughts he says the wild cut is active i felt like my team had been underperforming and harlem was aive jacket keeping us up so here we are im looking at xia pedro and seena rotation they rotate quite nicely and it will allow me to play in bumo e salah harand and hav as my front five rogers is there as a budget option but im not against playing him as a philly passes the eye test as well ive got ryan havit ready for the fixture change for arsenal gami six and ill scout the impact of ards injury on them versus spurs and city before deciding who my third pick will be i dont want to lock in any future moves so going for arsenal and bumo now i feel sensible so its interesting that hes taken a very different approach to forer ins wild card getting the arsenal players now possibly at the trade of some points but saving transfers essentially marco says international breaks this early into the season should be illegal
