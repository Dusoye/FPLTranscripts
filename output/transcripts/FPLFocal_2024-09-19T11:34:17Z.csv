welcome back for another video were back with the experts video as we look at what the top managers are doing with their teams this week they transfer playing as captain see in the experts team between them all they finished first in the world once top 100 four times top 1k 44 times and top 10k 367 times so hit subscribe to benefit from all this data every week this season kicking off with the manager highlight and gams moved to top of the experts league with a score of 76 points which takes him up to 40k overall hes also the big score in the league last game the average score in the experts league was 50 points its been overall challenging and unpredictable start to the season lucas s f analytic makes interesting charts plotting how the elite thousand do each season which is the top thousand alltime managers and this season theyve started the slowest since he started recording the data with an average rank of 22 mil but you just know in about 15 game each time theyll have caught up in fact if we look at last season that was the previous slowest start ever but they still had the best average final rank in the top 000 managers averaging 30k between them all so the climb is on if you keep making good decisions eventually the variance will swing your way so dont get reckless with your decisions or go on tilt so whats the plan this week then 68 to rolling the transfer 20 to making one move 12 of making two transfers no chips active this week among the experts it is a good week to roll if were able to because of the fixture swings coming up in game6 fpl is all about trying to stay ahead of the curve double or triple arsenal when the home to leicester is huge upside gameing six and theom is going to be a very popular move as well given their fixture run and from gami s man city have got full and woles southampton bourn and brighton if you havent got harem then youll need those transfers and itll be a priority then many are eyeing up a gaming six wild card but now that we can roll transfers into wild cards taking two or more to the other side of its going to be very powerful so which players are they buying and selling this week the top transfer in is salah 13 of the experts have bought him if youve got an easy route to salah it seems worth it where it gets trick is whether its worth harand to salah if youre going to walk on and game six anyway as thats two moves for a one we play and youre sing the most own player in the game which carries a lot of risk though there is huge upside in the play like that salah nonowners let us know in the comments whether youre going to be getting him or not and if youre doing it how are you doing it 14 are selling sacka whos the logical one though he has assisted every arsenal goal this season besides the one he scored himself and hes yet to blank away at man city though so it is a sound move this week 11 of b and vardy 7 to buy calv leen both of these teams are hitting a decent stretch of longterm fixtures and they both got two goals to their name cal ls also got an assist and all of his returns coming in the last two games i prefer him to vy personally but its pretty close vys taken three shots and he scored twice so those arent sustainable numbers i do recognize hes a poacher cal ls taking six shots if you are looking at cal leen wait till the press conference is as he been a sickness bug sweeping through the everton camp and he did miss out midweek in the league cup 7 to b watkins this week who is a player on the rise after a slow start to the season a brace last game and hes still got good enough fixures to buy him hes got wolves i switch man united fulman bournemouth so isaks the most sold player 14 of selling him very unfortunate for owners last game he took a ball in the face and he had to come off cuz he apparently had an issue with his eye youd expect him to be fine and recovered for game five against fulham though lots of those buy and seller are going isach to one of those cheap forwards so theres calv leen vardy welbeck jaia pedro archer wheatley and then theyre making the second moov sacka to salah which players have been delivering the most promised after four gams a day to them harlands 503 expected goal bom is highest in the league so far and its de bruy salah watkins and seeno de bruy owners have been unlucky so far and on top of that he was taken off at hal time in the champions league to keep an eye on that if youve got him he might have a knock were still waiting for foden to get going as well having been used pretty sparingly so far we saw just how good the upcoming fixures are and if he does start against arsenal then he could be an option for gaming six or gamic seven if you want to wait and see if he starts against newcastle seeno leaps off the page here given how cheap is relative to the other players near him hes got southampton home in gamei 6 leester away in gamei 7 56 mil mcneil also a notable one here given those upcoming games 257 expected goal involvement hes created five big chances which is the most in this list bums 343 expected goal involvement also impressive given that they faced liverpool and city already all the data tables here are available in the scout members area use a link l below to get 40 off and take advantage of all the other tools there as well no chips active this week but a very quick chip overview then so 75 have still got their wild card 100 still have their free hit unsurprisingly 98 still got the bench boost and 88 still have the triple captain i wouldnt be surprised to see 30 or maybe 40 wild card in gamei 6 to catch those fixture swings lets move straight on to gami 5 captaincy then theres five names this week which caught me by surprise however its still very onesided 80 5 to go with salah against bournemouth and then its harlem with 7 watkins 4 palmer 2 son and vardy captain by one each as far as the anytime goal scor probability salahs top this week hes been given a 45 chance of scor in anytime then its harand 395 son watkins both on 37 so what do reviews projections say this week then its got salah comfortably ahead on 77 points and then it sun on 64 palmer 6 harem 56 despite the blanking gami for salah still enjoying his best ever start of the season for fb points after four games thats crazy when you think about it given that its his eighth year at liverpool and he started better than when he broke the alltime record for fb points with 303 moving on to the experts team which is comprised of the most owned players across all their teams for the template team its henderson in goal its trent coner and por in the back three the midfield five is rogers salah e j and smith harand is jaia pedra up top so salah captain harand vice how many players have you got from the team this week there are a few issues starting to emerge henderson and gos been disappointing mun has lost his spot up top its almost certainly going to be himz again isak does have higher ownership than moonis but to keep the team with budget weve got mois in joshu and diaz is expecting minute to decline in as well gakpo was unbelievable in the champions league when he started ahead of diaz j started and he came off early didnt have a great game and of course theres no arsenal players here ahead of game6 either so well see a huge number of wild cerss active on next weeks edition so make sure you subscribe so you dont miss that onto the experts final thoughts and tips for gami 5 heres what they had to say this week joe jenkins says most likely move for me is moon is but i might end up taking a hit or even deciding the wild card depending on the press conference updates regarding isak and ky b injuries and possible jot rotation i dont think its a great week to wild card but i may have my hand forced meaning id have to just get a wild card six squad a week early most likely fpl cholo has taken a onewe punt he says calculated risk by bringing in son to captain i dont have and i cant get to him without a hit so im hopeful that sun can match or better salah and harem this week planned wild card in gamei 6 benny m90 has sold harand and gibbs white for salah and salanki and he says this might be the time for a trip to dfs to buy a bigger sofa for us harand sellers this week fb addict says i often find people panic immediately after a bad game league especially if theyve just played a wild card my suggestion is dont forget what made you buy a player in the first place additionally i think the five free transfer rule will benefit those who stick to a good strategy allowing them to store transfers and mini wild card multiple times throughout the season panic selling players will hurt your ability to do that brians been w up selling munos for a one week pump but decided against it to carry the extra transfer over on the wild card and he says im rolling so ill have three free transfers off to wild card six unfortunately i dont think its worth the transer moving muno to another sub five mil defender this week so double crystal palace defense will be minimal points thanks for watching as always and thanks to the managers for sending their responses in every week see you soon for the next one
