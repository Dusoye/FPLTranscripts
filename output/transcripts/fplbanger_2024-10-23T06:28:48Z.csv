as a nonh highland owner i just i i would just take the hit and have faith that its a strategy over a long time period and not a game week you cant just look at a single game week beir you were always very confident that call it confidence call it h i wouldnt say confident after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit im not going to lie but i stuck with the decision and it paid off i pity the people who miss out the halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks this thing hello everyone welcome back to the fbl bangers show my name is sila im joined by sam game week nine preview sam but sam im seeing a lot of initial content this week about how game week eight was worst game week ever disaster i feel i feel like im out of sync with the rest of the fpl community how about you s same saa same saa why saa its because you have a good fpl player as your port mate who convinced you not to make stupid decisions last week like take out muhammad salah i will readily accept that i had you not told me like what are you doing why do you want phil for and he never starts but i almost certainly would have made that move so thank you sir just doing my job saa just doing my job so good week for both of us especially good week for you we had 52 i had 42 both green arrows 52 with 10 players with my second most expensive player my team not starting which is saka and i have all my bench players didnt play not so and to be fair not your bench wasnt like nonplayable you had coner gaves you just you got unlucky but didnt matter in the end it didnt matter they would have given me like one point anyway so its a one point difference and so okay so we both had good weeks and were quite happy and to be fair i think both our seasons are when you look around and shouldnt compared to content creators specifically but just in general right a lot of people are struggling down in the millions so we started off okay were both doing all right that being said sam got to keep going weve kept salah throughout this entire period and as you can see on the screen now salah now the top point scorer what do you think about salah going into this is it is it even difficult run of fixtures not right arsenal is his last hard fixture and is that even fixure right now i think liverpool can score in any game salah can score in any game there is there are hard fixtures for the team yes to come away with a win but i think salah has just proven himself time and time again season after season and like i told you last week he has only blanked twice this entire season in eight games blanked twice and five of those were double digit halls so come on why are you even taking him out and i think its some alignment of stars has happened for salah as well he got in sense that chelsea didnt have kara for far last week arsenal most likely were recording wednesday morning i would say califur is probably not going to play he came off with the injury yesterday so no salah against arsenal against zenchenko is not going to be thats a mismatch zko has barely played all season and then sal also out sorry just to sid trck a video see the interview with z jenko about his training session with pep i did i did tell the people what was it he made one wrong pass pep scolded him for it and hes like i just made one wrong pass and pep very pep like very sarcastically just say okay and then he just ended the training session asked everyone to go in and im pretty sure immediately he went up to the b were selling zenko right now and thats the story of to arsenal passive aggressive but its a bit lets lets talk a bit about arsenal right are you concerned slash are you worried about how things have been going because theyve okay so against lester and southampton you could argue fluke goals but i was very surprised with how bourou turned out stupid decision from celba like you dont give the ref a chance to send you off that early in the game making a tackle like that and so even against shakar last night very leggy just got across the line but coming into arsenals runner fixures doesnt look great we can show you on the screen the here so arsenals next fixtures liverpool newcastle chelsea and then is forest which i think we all agree now is harder fixture than he used to be so with that in mind sideb barring from salah to arsenal assets what do you do with aral assets going into this week i think the only arsenal asset most people have would be saka right and harvit u talking about attackers first right lets lets separate it out so i think i was waiting for the champions league we are recording this on wednesday morning so weve only seen the first round of games i was i think if saka had started i would have kept him in my team but because he didnt start he didnt start last weekend im getting a bit worried so i think this is the week i sell saka very begrudgingly though because when you look at how saka has performed this season hes only blanked once of the seven games hes played right like i think i said this maybe last week or the week before harand and salahs performance at the start of the season distorted peoples perception of what a good fpl asset is what if youre not scoring hat tricks every week then i dont want you but in any other season right you take a player who has only blank once in seven game weeks like thats as good as it gets yes its not sexy its not double digit halls but very good still however with the injuries and with the other options coming up i think this is the week i let go of saka harits though would you would you sell harits i think if you have a cher to spare i would because there are so many options now further down but lets get into forwards later i think lets stick with arsenal first defense though im happy to keep the defense i think because i dont want to make a defensive move i think its tricky lets lets start off with the defense cuz thats the probably the easiest sale to make in terms of in terms of funds it requires and all that your initial instinct is you look at these pictures and think you got to sell all their defenders but weve always said this about arsenal right we said this at the start of season hard fix just where they rise to the occasion and they set out to defend i expect arsal to go against lpool and play for a draw and play for nil i especially if saks out like theres no attacking impetus in the side i would assume the same probably happens at st j spk possibly even at stafford bridge against chelsea so im not in a rush to get rid of defenders i get starting off with dav ryer l i have david ryer you have david ryer as well so look hes a hes a goalkeeper m like there will be a lot of recency bias because sells got 11 points this week ver bren got 10 but keepers are not going to have double digit halls most week so that is a position you dont make a transfer in there unless your keeper has got a sixmonth injury thats it otherwise youve got your keeper youve committed to him unless you have somebody like arola this no reason to make a transfer in that department defenders gabriels still got attacking threat and thats not going to change so not a priority sale but if youre using him to fund moves elsewhere im okay with that because i think weve got a few budget defenders who look interesting now and and so with that in mind lets do that because i think of course youre not going in the order you expect to but i think that makes sense if youre going to sell an arsenal defender who are you going to sell him for okay my number one budget defender which will be one of my transfer st is ryan anuri who i already mentioned last week now w fix just turn this week onwards so and asa has on the screen defenders with the most attacking returns ryan anui at four joined with nathan collins very surprisingly nathan collins but so whos fixtures brighton palace southampton wam bonemouth everton west ham it swit leicester before it starts to turn in game we 18 with united spurs forest newcastle chelsea so then it gets bad get them out then thats a good eight weeks no i cant count its a good r good number of weeks good number of weeks so and hes attacking he plays like a winger right in their formation didnt do particularly well this week against city it is against city but in every other week hes been underlying stats look good underlying numbers looks good ryan ani 44 my first choice budget defender and i should just point out this is a graphic from official fpl so i dont think that lucas dean place for evon still this is were too lazy to make our own graphic so this is what happens when you start boring other peoples content i a very nice pick for me but im surprised you didnt mention someone else sam and i come back here to the fixtures this is fdr tak from reddit as usual and top of the fdr chart is everton and they have a four point come on but they have a 43m attacking defender who you im surprised sam you didnt even mention him r moleno youve got southampton you love michael and what fulham southampton west ham brenford united wolves all decent fixtures brande i think brwi being out has always has been the real issue this season but hes i think almost back to full fitness meanwhile michael keane has turned into karen benzema hes if you havent seen michael keans goal this week against ips which you go and check it out now because that is you could have two keepers there theyre not stopping that finish and 43m for m eno after i said jok merson was a great option last week things happen but surely that cant happen again to m eno i dont know you look at the fixure do you think theyre keeping a clean she against fulham no r himz is just on fire southon maybe west ham although playing bad theyre still scoring every single game branford you think a clean sheet there united wolves i think it looks nicer on paper when you look closely i dont see many clean sheets there for everton i would rather go for brenford defender nathan collins brenford have not kept a clean all season mate but he has attacking trap apparently hes been fluking these assists right you can you look at this and this graphic is like wow collins has four assist but lets we watch the games and even like the most casual person knows i n andan holl very different comparison youre getting nathan collins center back who has been fortunate to get these assists and i come back to brenford fixes okay sure i switch may be a clean i dont think fulhams a clean game for them i dont think bonds a clean sam perhaps what were doing here you dont seem convinced by mel eno im not convinced by branford defenders maybe to your initial point we should probably keep the arsenal defenders because they play for a half decent team and decent teams are the ones that tend to keep cleans and unless you need the money then okay woles defender thatll be my number one choice number two a forest defender that will be my second choice who are decent for fixures and have been keeping some clean sheets so i think they kept their third clean sheet of the season so far which is which is okay and you can get multiple defenders at 45 you could get ola aa you could get milenovic so nia milenovic very tall aial threat sent back from florentina from floren for me in my florentina safe in fm you must be sad about you youll be carrying on that save for another 12 months you must be very annoyed about fm not coming out i know but i sid tracking a bit i dont get fm every year anyway because im i dont know to a new fm i have to start a new team but what about my old my current team havent achieved all i wanted with them yet so thats thats a very positive thats thats what they should instead of tweeting every day with their half apologies thats what they should say now you get to spend another year with your team okay moving forward okay so nica bankovich i like he got the assist against chelsea and hes i think his arrival has definitely youve seen an upturn in forest defense they dont concede from set pieces as nearly as often as they used to lot of improvement there the only thing is forest fixtures as we have them on the screen here leicester west ham decent then its newcastle arsenal city in the next four after that so if you can rotate him maybe although as we say defender rotations arent the best but if you can play somebody else in 12 and 14 and if youre getting two cheap defenders lets say you get rid of gabrielle and you get two 45s you could have maybe an everton defender in 12 and 14 or you could have a i dont know maybe you could have a even a walz defender 12 and 14 thats not too bad but you see if rotation issue i will go for wols defender because great fixtures and even if the fixes doesnt look like cling ry and has so much attacking potential you would just play him anyway so thats why they are my one number one pick and i know a lot of people they look back at the first eight games and like theyve considered like a ungodly amount of goals but again if you look at the fixtures they have not played a single team below the top 10 right so every single team theyve played has been in the top half of theyve only played good teams so that their good run starts now lets see where it goes 45 is worth a risk i think or 44 and i think the city performance is very encouraging they reduce city to almost next to no attacking threat so okay im down with that shut down we got to talk about okay well get to holland in a sec but just wrapping up defenders real quick here just moving up in budget right cuz if youre selling the likes of gabrielle youre going down 5m defenders for me theres only one guy right its kate and you probably dont get konate this week unless youre on wild card but i think next week you get konate and you just park him in your team agreed you do save a lot of money it depends from gabri you save about one mill exactly 63 to 53 so thats thats not nothing and i think pedro poro sam you and i have not been convinced never been convinced and we remain unc unconvinced that pretty much sums it up for federal for and spur defense as a whole i think takes a few good shots youll get your hall eventually but were not interested ask about guardal here yes i was going to come to what do you think so no weve got this on the screen now i did not realize this but its it sounds legit once you start thinking about it since the start of last season no defender scored more goals its now six goals i feel like scoring bangers he had that run like the last 10 games of last season where he just withing every single game he was insane one of those super annoying he cant keep this up and then he kept this up and he ruined your season if you didnt have him i feel like scoring bangers is not sustainable and but some point city have to start keeping clich sheet right this not keep they do but it always starts at the second half of the season i dont know why people keep forgetting about it and i think its recency biased because they end the season so strongly keeping clean sheets winning every single game that in the start of the new season people forget that in the first half they never keep clean sheets before christmas okay so you are comfortable not to have gardio against south apton maybe probably one clean sheet there but im i just feel with the price and everything i rather just get a budget defender at this point and then pump it into the mids and forwards im because i have rico lewis im content to just hold on to that i think for the price im getting what i expected like yes gavs doing well with these shots from 30 yards out but logically that just cant continue and to that point rico lewis is getting into more attacking positions than guardal so bangers aside you just look at their heat map and the play style you would expect rico lewis to return more and he has shown that with assist this season which is which is a good return for a 45 defender when we bought him so i think im content you get what you pay for rico lewis i think the value is there so happy to hold and i think walkers got some injury issues which is also good for lewis i think he seems to have kept his place in the team regardless of what anyone else thinks about whether he is right for that slot so i think thats defense right theres no nobody else to talk about in defense no i dont think so so lets lets i was going to talk about mids but i want to come back to forwards because were on city right lets talk about harand for a bit okay so you must be thrilled because you have i am call it black magic call it i dont know what powers youre using ive captained this guy three weeks in a row for three blanks i told you not the captain this guy for three weeks in a row for his three blanks by the way see and im going to do it for fourth week in a row so at the end of gamei one i was ranked seven mill for going without harand and thanks to his blanks im now 700k so my rank is inversely proportional to hollands performance its interesting right because if he blanks against southampton i think if he does anything less than score two goals i expect people to sell him after southampton like that is the mood now and were all human you just we cant stop ourselves at this point if he blanks against southampton like hes gone gone is that rash dont i dont know he never my theme so now heres the point im just going to say for those people who started the season with hland the logic was not that your player would outscore harland every single week the logic is that over a long enough sample size time period your two players so harand and a versus salah and a better budget player would outscore them and i think so far has shown to be true although i dont know is 10 games are short enough big enough sample size well see now i do i do expect harand to score big this week traditionally he has always scored very big when he plays a promoted side at home right so it doesnt get any better than this if i had i might even triple captain him this week so as a nonland owner i just i would just take the hit and have faith that its a strategy over a long time period and not a game weck you cant just look at a single game weck okay so all fair points my question is the fixtures are they hes its not like as if hes a cell with these fixtures right hes a cell bas on form if we recognize form as a like a thing but after southampton its bnorth brighton spurs in 12 we dont think spurs is a hard defense so maybe 13 right maybe 13 is where you might consider selling your point is that hes not a bad option just full stop and he will score goals but you can rebuild him with the funds that youre saving for money ball money ball and long enough to the season where you now feel confident well to be fair you were always very confident that call it confidence call it h i wouldnt say confident after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit s im not going to lie but i stuck with the decision and it paid off i pity the people who missed out the halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks so thats quite funny i also i dont say i pity them im laughing at them but sure lets lets go with pity okay so i think howand easy its not a question to think about so much this week because no ones selling him before southampton and people like you who dont own are just hoping for the best is what i would assume ive seen some chat about using free hit this week for non holland teams i think thats very shortsighted okay it depends it depends i the reasoning is that your other premium assets like salah is playing arsenal away saka might not play all these other guys dont exactly have the greatest fixture so maybe thats the reasoning however i wouldnt i dont think its worth a for hit in my personal opinion i wouldnt do it ill wait for a bigger opportunity down the road like salah is going to play and could return taka if you just play you sell him youve got alternatives i dont think free hit feels like yes city southampton very good fixture yes you dont have harand youll feel bad but use your funds you can get other players who could still do well this week and i think free hits just too powerful a chip to throw away this early in the season where you dont know what blanks are going to happen you dont know how they will shape out and then youve used a chip for maybe howand gets a brace i dont think a free hit is worth it and for the same reason like that so triple capc is less risky because its its a its a its a youre focusing on harand alone but even then for me triple captain is about vibes and im just not feeling the vibes now so thats the thing there will never be vibes for holland because everyone owns him everyone fair but im prepared im prepared to wait for a dou game where there will be possible vibes and at least ill have a guaranteed fourpointer on my hands times three so i am prepared to wait for that rather than throw it away this early in the season and also in the same way that owning chriswood was nice this week because you got to monday night and you still had you could see like some extra light at the end of the tunnel or youre in my case like this is just going to get better i like having a triple captain c for towards the back end of the season i dont want to throw it away so early fair enough i think okay emotional reasons but if you want stats and other stuff you can go somewhere else this we all about vibes here so on saka you mentioned saka lets talk about other premiums because weve covered harand weve covered salah lets talk about palmer and so kmer where you at it probably be my transfer in this week probably you think newcastle is in good fixture now newcastle is great fixture theyre horrible and i think palmer can return against anyone right like he has that quality he was close against liverpool and i would say the three toughest fixtures in the season is when youre playing away against liverpool away arsenal and away city right im i fif in palmer i think he would do well so palmer in will probably be my transfer this week okay lets lets jump back again were flipping through but lets look at his fixtures right he plays palmer plays newcastle then its man united then its arsenal so thats his next three but arsenal home i which i think makes a big difference honestly in duis fair and ill take your point at pal can probably return against anyone hes got enough roots hes got set pieces hes got pens hes got the ability to shoot it from 30 yards and goes in the only question i have is would you rather have palmer this week or would you rather have sun now its insane that im asking the question because i think a few weeks ago if you asked me would i want son anywhere near my team heck no but i think for us both of us didnt have sun last week i think we got away with one like he on another day he gets that assist right fpl eventually removed the assist for their own goal but on another day they probably just leave that on another day he gets the goal right because he shot it at goal and then he goes in he also hit the post after that and that sun on limited minutes just back from injury spur next three fixtures two of the next three look good they play palace villa ipswitch so palace and ips switch to me seems like a much better combo than palmers next three so whilst i dont think i think suns not been in our thoughts because spurs have been inconsistent but and i think partly also because both of us already have other sp assets like you have brandon johnson i have medicine i brought in last week so to double up im not so sure i think for us but looking in the perspective of someone who has no spur assets i think sun is a very interesting asset hes i dont know why but it feels like hes always been a differential like even every season hes been in the league hes been a differential somehow just gets overlooked and i think its because he tends to return big in one game double digit hall very high ceiling but then goes missing in terms of fpl points he blanks two games three games and then another big hall two games three games so it becomes frustrating for owners so thatll be my warning for anyone who is thinking about going to sun you have to be able to weather the blanks if you want his returns im not strong enough so im going to go for farmer although im not going to say sun is a bad asset right its comparing a good asset with another good asset person i think fmer outscore sun more than so i think the difference is price is about 1 mil right suns 99 palmers 10 eight so i think palmer will outscore him in the long run and im im i think fmer is probably a season keeper for me baring any injuries or anything like that so thats why im going palmer i take your point that we both have brandon john well do you have brandon johnson i have medison ironically let me give you my reasoning so i wanted to go brandon johnson but i thought ca already has brand johnson i dont want to get the same play as ca vital fpl strategies very valid medison has been doing well the entire season good underlying numbers he his one mill more but i thought my thinking ironically was that medicines minut should be more secure than brandon johnson right brandon johnsons a winger wingers t to come off theyre having a bad game spurs has options on the wings madisons creative half of the team should be secure ironically he got taken off first because they felt they need more physical presence in the midfield even more ironically despite being taken on first he still out scot br and johnson and solanki so and he registered good stats in that 45 minutes he had a xa of 6 06 in just half a match and he had six key passes so i dont think this thing will happen often him getting taken off at halim so im happy going forward with medison lets be real sam youre not happy youre just relieved that you escaped with it this week and im happy once i looked at the underlying numbers and i thought okay i dont think hell be taken on too taken off too often and he still is the creative half of the team despite the fact that the team scor three once he left okay you sound convinced i dont but what i will say is that i dont think so the next few games right especially palace lets just take it as a small sample size i dont think palace midfield is anything to worry about i dont see post goo taking off madison because hes scared of will hughes right so and this a guy who hasnt scored since a few years ago so who cares i i dont think this is a concern for you short term longterm maybe different brenon johnson had the most xg of anybody in the spur team 089 so one of those rare days where br johnson had a lot of chances and didnt convert not concerned very good minutes very good for his priz bringing it back full circle sam i dont think the fact that we have another spurs attacker should have any relevance on psychologically sure but it has no relevance on sun being a good asset but there is psychologically right if youre bringing in a spur asset you could look at it and say h why dont i just bring in brandon johnson instead of sun and save that three mill for wherever else my team needs it okay could i not then ask you i this comparison doesnt sound as good but maybe after this week if you won co palmer could you not just save 3m and get nicholas jackson thats a good point but i think the gap between niiko jack and palmer is way bigger in terms of point potential however though i will say im very impressed by niik jack i think hes going to have a good season im starting to warm up to the idea of u bring of him as a f asset but that aside well discuss that later theres also the fact that theyre both midfielders sa so they take up slots niiko jack forward kob midfield so its a different comparison its like saka and harvard whereas this one is like having both jot and salah okay so do you remember a few weeks back when people are saying i dont need salah l diaz can cover salah fa fair okay thats the question its debatable but brandon johnson is a much safer position because his minutes are much better than diaz or jot versus salah so to your point you can theoretically match sun because you have nailed midfielders who are competing with him as opposed to the local situation where you had non nail midfielders rotation risks competing against salah okay so roundabout way i see how you can get away without sun although im not looking forward to the next two weeks if you have solan you keep and if you dont own youre very happy and youre not going to go near him right still figuring out his position in this attack i think although a bit unlucky i would say because every single week has been doing well underlying numbers great one of i would consider this a oneoff week for brandon johnson for soan that they didnt return okay on a wider question right because were talking about forwards and midfielders and premiums and so on do you think now is the time you mentioned this earlier weve got so many forward options is now the time to shift back to 343 or whatever any formation that gets you three forwards i think if im on a wild cut i would strongly consider it if on a free transfer is a bit hard because that means you need to waste a transfer to bring down one of your forwards to like a bench for and then bring it up so its a bit trickier if youre on free transfers if you have a lot of free transfers if you youve kept 10 or five then sure go for it u for the rest of us feels like a bit of a waste of a move but i am i like the forwards right now if i could i would do it im im upset with wood for scoring because i wanted to take him out this week i won r himz in my team i won but i cant justify taking wood out in his scoring every we can he stop scoring its a nice problem to have sam i have zero interest in taking out chris wood who as we can see now since nuno arrived third highest goal scorer in the league and i think the best thing about chriswood is it annoys non chriswood owners so much like the keep i keep seeing these post he cant keep doing this his numbers are trash this is a bad team how does he keep scoring all these fpl accounts all these content creators who dont have wood who cant get wood and its hard for them but i think its its easy for us i could say its a forward where the team play style suits him and hes on pants and hes cheap and hes lowly owned so im not going to lie though i am tempted by the wolves forwards matthew k and jacob strand lson the what hland wishes he could be and then im also very tempted by r himz so a lot of good f options in that in that price braet so you cant go wrong unless you picked domate kavn so to be fair right there are a lot of fpl podcast that were told you that cal luin good pick you should go for him four weeks ago we were not one of those people so i hope you remember that neither of us have owned calvin lin do not own him and every week i see posts about calvin lin on the other end of the spectrum very good xg the chances will come eventually the goals will come but this is a guy who cant finish any of his chances hes underperformed his xg for a very long time and surely his next injury not to wish ill will on anybody but i think its d cal l so happy to not own and not at all interested but since as you say that right strand lson kunia gimenez all youre very interested in so thats my point right you want three attackers now were also at a stage where the budget mids slim pickings i think especially at the five to six million bracket compared can i just out just to remind you that we had this conversation last week as well and i said but morgan rogers is still doing well and you were like no just terrible player doesnt deserve to be a professional footballer something like that and i pleaded his case as a non morgan rogers owner i pleaded his case to a morgan rogers owner i hope you thank me s i hope you deep down inside your hey i raised my hands up of course slight deflection well not slight significant deflection on his goal but a goal a goal assist yesterday in champions league so my man is doing it on all stages and his minutes are inexplicably secure like this guy just plays every single minute hes hes aston villa saka it makes no sense for price that was my big point last week like for his price dont you want a player like who can perform like that at 65 you would be happy with that with hiss no i put my hands up and that brief flotation i had of going for faku bonot who did point out he did score and still has very good fixtures so remains i okay to be fair forest i we need to go update this fdr forest not a good fixure so for is not r right but lets talk about some other midfielders sam and one who i got a b to pick with you seb i noticed a lot of content creators this week are telling me that gacho is the best pick in the game at his price so let me talk to united fan the week i sold him now i maintain i maintain that ive always said since the very first gaming of the season that gacho is a good pick and the best pick in man utd if you want a man utd attacker he is the guy you get and do not consider anyone else do not consider bruno fernandez kacho however i just was not convinced by united as a whole and i remain unconvinced despite one good game one good half i would say i remember unconvinced i still think gachu will take over because hes the main attacking threat right like he he does everything hes the only guy taking shots and things like that now the hland in maybe things are changing right they do seem better but i just feel there are other players who are less risky so thats why i made the move to medison lost me six points i think but its okay in the long run i expect sp to score more goals than united lets lets do a direct comparison because we were talking about positions right gachas 62 i think and uniteds fixtures are west ham chelsea leicester iwi everton these are on paper good fixtures for a good team i dont know if uniteds a good team so comparing but comparing gacho right so gacho 62 mid versus br lson 55 kuna 63 jimenez 57 whist back this week 59 now know you going to tell me midfielders versus forwards right but for people like me who have two transfers this is a quite critical question this week like do you go with gacho over all the budget forwards no my take is no because the budget forwards have roots and alternatives and plan bs if you own calv l youre sick of him you have other options if you own gacha and you dont like him like where do you go your options are pretty limited i agree and i think just even as a whole the other especially real himz right hes my number one hes number one on my wish list i just cant find a way to him this week but can we talk about ress a little bit he has scored like every single game that since he started right in gamei four goal assist goal underlying numbers are extremely good xdi of 74 against villa against city 124 against forest the week before 094 the week before that against newcastle 5 those are great underlying numbers and so cheap 57 and pretty good fixture r coming up so everton brenford palace woles spurs brighton before he plays arsenal and liverpool back to back rd jenez come on if youre looking for a budget forward he has to be real himz and i think we said this last week hes not on pens i think after this week he has to be on f because andre pereira man what thats thats a embarrassing as an effort as youll ever make and i think marco silva has to see sense now r herz has i think like 36 pens scored in out of 38 something ridiculous he has to take the next one yes so ra himz propaganda go for ra himz i would rate him any player below seven m maybe he would be my top choice hard to argue right im im struggling to think of anybody whos under seven well gacho but youve already made your case clear and im inclined to agree with you because need to see more from united just so inconsistent right yes west hams a good fixture but just need to see more from united i think ask any united fan is the easy fixtures that scar us no and i think what jimenez has hes unique right theoretically on pens im im going to go out and say that which tran lson wont have you have to pay extra to get to kunia but kunia plays a little further back so you want str lon but at the same time k has better underlying numbers than str lon okay not this week in particular but in the previous weeks so i would if i were to get a woles forward i would pay the extra for k okay fair but just i the fact that we have so many options right and forward just feels like this is why this is a better slot to play around with and him menz even wood i think the run is shorter like i think if you already own wood is good but would you get wood now hard to say i think its just hes just not as sexy as ro himz even the name like chris christopher wood versus r himz whats sounds more exotic fromand man thats thats as far as always it gets and man came back scored against tahiti scored against malaysia came back still scored like very consistent its amazing right chriswood him man has all 30 plus experienced guys just consistent like what you get from them im interested in yan wia but the only issue is that hes just back from injury like this week i wish he was back most of us already have more and although we should look at assets individually and not coverage doesnt it doesnt make sense right its a fallacy but in my mind i cant argue with the way my mind thinks and my mind is thinking i dont want to dou up on a brandford defense brandford attack its very fascinating that you feel so strongly because i know i started the season with solan son poro like i enjoy i dont know maybe this is a bit of like im a bit sick in that where i want to go all in on a fixture and then you on the other hand are very ive got one guy from this good team thats good enough for me let me spread it logic to both approaches but and i think if the fixes are great then double up triple up sounds nice sounds fun but at the moment because there are so many options i dont know maybe im a bit greedy right its like a bo and i want a little bit of every team so i see team up doing well so like okay i dont need wia although he will be a good asset because they do have a good fixture r i haveo from the brenford tray let me pick a bit from the fulham tray taste it a bit i think the nice thing about himz is first of all a lot of people dont have the ability to get to him like you sam as you tell me now lot people just dont have a forward slot to spare and lot of people just dont place him as a priority which feels that always feels like a nice transfer to make like we went in on chriswood a few weeks ago because everybody was not like they had better things to do but we felt likeone was going everyone was going for kev lein my sympathy is to them although dwight mcneel has been good ive been impressed even his assist this week like twinkle toes hes left right he beats like four guys very nice assist and should have had more if calv leen could finish the amount of chances cal leen puts wi is hes just so inconsistent agre okay niik ja we mentioned him briefly but i do like i do like him so similar price point with solank both i think he 79 san is 8 point something right but nich jackson i think will be a good asset this year im going to put my hat down and it doesnt feel so controversial to say at this point i would say like im with you like i think the only thing thats stopping me from niik jack is i read the next three fixtures of being a little harder than you do i think newcastle were quite unlucky against brighton i watched the game and they lost but they had the bulk of the chances and brighton scored from one of their only chances so i think newcastle play up to chelsea and i dont see them getting smashed but dco ja could score same united partly is that just the budget forwards are performing so well so why would you pay 79 for forward when you can pay for real humanz save like two m which you could use in your midfield and stuff like that true agree i think there just a lot of value in the budget forwards now whether perhaps wasnt at the start of the season nobody was thinking of strand lon and he but things change quickly okay so i thats thats all we want to talk about lets lets talk about let me humor you all you nonhand teams there must be more now than they were captain c this week weve got it here check the chance you can follow them on reddit twitter so on so holland teams you captain holland sam but who are you captaining do you think phil foran starts this week i dont have a clue and we have we are recording before the champ were recording before champions league right so will they make a difference if he doesnt start champions league you will argue with yourself and say thats good so p is saving him for the weekend because they could not create chances until he comes on if he starts the champions league you go thats good p trust him surely he starts this weekend as well confirmation bias so no one knows no one knows if ph start which is such a shame i want to believe he starts because they struggled without a proper creator with no kb and no forden they were struggling and their winning goal came from a foren corner right so i want to believe that for starts but you dont and that alone is if you own forin its one thing but to bring him in and captain him i think thats no its just too much its too much risk and also we have a deadline on friday so youre not going to get leaks that early so with all that if you yes it could it work yes could you get lucky sure but its just too its too much for me and i and i have the slot available to make the transfer im not going to even consider it so no not foren i think you need us you want to be sure your captain please is what i would say and so my captain this week will be palmer who probably will be my transfer in from saka to palmer captain p i like it okay all right guess newcastle has not exactly been great especially away i think okay thats thats a bold captaincy but i cant question you captain salah last week and i would not have done that i kep last week i kept saka the week before so youre on a roll a role with my captain im going to say i also captain that one week where he hed in chry so been doing well with the differential captains youre not tempted by emba captain now hes too mainstream for you is it ownership of 30 not to say palmer is not mainstream right but i dont know i just like palmer i got a good feeling about it this week if not palmer it would have beeno okay fair enough its interesting right we talk so much about vibes and feelings like i would have assumed sun would be higher on this chart than palmer given the fixture sun versus palace who havent relegation threatened palace versus pal against newcastle but i would think its a marginal difference that if i 32 and i think its probably just home and away right spurs are playing away chelsea is playing at home but it also speaks to palmers talismanic influence you could call it consistency that in a hard fixture hes this high up the chart like salah against arsenal also fairly high up considering the opposition palmer salah harand are seen by bookies and that theres probably some facts to it theres fpl points that show it theyre in one level and then everybody else is the next level agree is that evan ferguson is that is that is evan ferguson because brighton have run out of available forwards pedro still injured welbeck stretch it off this week i thought well post an update and saying hell be fine and stuff but its danny welbeck and injuries like i will not trust anything he says true and ferguson did start to be fair so interesting if he was fit right why can no fpl p just bring it in themselves find it in themselves to recommend very well back hes the second highest forward now higher than any of the other people weve discussed right and only like 19 points behind highland despite being like one third of his price but we just cant seem to be in ourselves to recommend people to buy dan back i feel bad because like ive got like friends and stuff who are casuals who do have danny well back all were thinking about it and then when jao pedro because they would have asked me and i said no man you nobody gets well back everyone you just dont do that i again not s like this is going to like i s like a bad person but i was half happy when i read that he was injured i was like thank god hes got to stop scoring which is it because im a united fan youre an arsenal fan we both our clubs have both owned danny back at certain points in his career and so we just dont see the quality whereas if we never watched football before and were coming in this season fresh i guarantee you we would have recommended well back so its just bias its true because see we werent fans of the clubs chriswood played for we werent fans of the clubs jz played for we knew them but we didnt have that level of not even expertise right but this idea that more weve seen danny welck play we know hes made of biscuits hes going to get injured in two days time and so therefore we never went for him and its been stupid because hes been that good and if hes fit this week im terrified because hes playing wolves no reason why he doesnt score again a good pick if you have him and for those of us who dont another week of just crying and hoping he doesnt score okay i think nothing else to discuss i think were good for game weck nine game nine i had to check lost track its coming very fast so we see you and we will see you next week
