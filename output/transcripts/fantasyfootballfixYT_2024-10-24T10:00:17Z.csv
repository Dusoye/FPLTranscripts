yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is fbo nacho and in todays video we are taking a look at the top transfers going into game week 9 in particular i want to cover off the best premium midfielder for your teams which spurs midfielder to go for and of course the best defenders for your team so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up we need to talk about the best premium midfielder for your teams and the three players that were going to be looking at right now are going to include phil foden son and cole palmer and its worth noting cole pama has had another price rise to 109m so he is the in demand midfielder for a lot of managers right now but these three midfielders all in their own right have a reason to be in your fpl teams i havent included moala because of course he is in his own bracket when it comes to price point and it will be a player maybe we touch on in a future video but today we are focusing on foden son and cole palmer so first up i want to address phil foden as an asset because in gw n and isolation i think he is the best option out of all of the three players at home against sath hampton played in their champions league fixture scored a goal and i would fully expect phil foden to feature in gw 9 as a starter we know that kevin de bruyne is still touch and go for gw 9 potentially back in gw 10 so i think the minutes for foden therefore are improved with that home game against southampton and based in terms of fixures there arent many better games you can get than southampton at home now look at the underly numbers i want to take these with a pinch assault because we havent seen phil foden much the season due to injury 015 xg per 90 not incredible 21 expected assists per 90 so you buying field foden on the basis of what weve seen last season and of course the fixture in hand outside of that i dont think he is a fantastic pick if you are going for just underlying numbers this season and if youre looking at a longterm option that is where i start to have slight concerns about phil foden because son and cole palmer i know im getting guaranteed minutes from them foding in game weeks 10 11 and 12 i have no idea right now so foden i think is the best pick in gweek n but not a good longterm option when we compare it to the other pick so again let me know in the comments section if youre looking at a one gw punt thatll be phil foden if were looking longer term son and co palmer now when we take a look at the both of these here palmer is just in a league of his own right now 54 expected goals per 90 055 expected assists per 90 double that of son that we have seen this season and the big chances palmers also accumulating at 092 per 90 minutes if i was in a situation right now where i didnt have a w card available even though the fixtures are very poor for chelsea some would argue i still would bring in cole palmer i think that is the case newcastle at home i dont think is a terrible fixture for chelsea man united away we dont know what man united team we are going to get and i still think palmer can deliver in that fixture arsenal at home is going to be the one that isnt that good for chelsea but then after that we know the fixtures longterm are fantastic and again the reason why i think the wild card is so important is because if you dont have it available i think palmer in gw 12 regardless is going to need to come into your team so it just ends up not having to use an additional transfer to get to him later down the line and of course with his price potentially rising again and again you might be picking him up at 11m come game week 12 especially if youre not going for a player that has high upside as an alternative whose price could increase as well and i do think one of those could be son now with those fixtures coming up palace away who are poor this season i think is fine aston villa at home not an incredible fixture im going to be honest with you but with that high line that they play could we see son score absolutely and then i switch at home the money fixture for son in game week 11 and especially when we compare that to what palmer has in that game week at home against arsenal now of course after that man city away in gw 12 whereas it swings for co palmer that is where you definitely would jump from son to co palmer and another reason why if you have your wild card available then ill be more tempted to maybe swing towards son knowing that you can easily jump to co palmer in gw 12 if you activate that wild card so on underline numbers right now and based on the longterm perspective i think co palmer is absolutely your man but if you have a wild card available and the potential of captaining son in game week 11 at home against ip switch means that i do like the option for son in your teams as a three game week punt and then move into cole palmer foden for me is just a one we punt and that is it then i think you are rolling the dice in terms of his minutes so those are my thoughts let me know who is the best premium for you in the comment section the one caveat that we need to say about son is that there are alternatives in that team whereas chelsea i think is cole palmer or nobody so taking into account son and those underlying numbers i now want to take a look at some alternative spurs midfielders because this may be where we need to go rather than son himself so here we have got the underlying numbers for the alternatives kulisy at 62m johnson at 67m and madison at 76m so little bit of a price difference between all of these players but all of these being at least 2m cheaper than that of son even the likes of johnson and koseski are more than 3m cheaper and what i think is important in our fpl teams to keep that premium spot in the midfield maybe the best alternative is having co palmer as your premium and one of these three as your spurs attacker so take a look at the underline numbers right now because we know the fixtures theyre great for the next three not very good in gw 12 in terms of xg the pattern continues brandon johnson is still the man you want to get if youre accumulating big chances and great goal scoring opportunities 048 expected goals per 90 is double that of son again johnson plays slightly more minutes than son but i think that brandon johnson was unlucky not to deliver in gw eight and on another day johnson picks up some returns son picks up some returns and were starting to ask the question is son worth the 3m more than brandan johnson i think hes shortterm narrative that is making us go towards son rather than still look at brandon johnson as a pick now on the bonus points he isnt great bonus points this season are catering towards those players that do a lot and get fouled a lot hence where you can see kulesi and madison decent on the bonus points per 90 there madison in particular now the one that i want to quickly pay attention to is going to be kulesi because hes getting a lot of talk right now the cheapest of the spurs midfielders at 62 with all the players now available for spurs son playing off the right the left brandon johnson off the right salanki down the middle seeing the two1 being deployed by an in pretty much every fixture when we take a look at the numbers for kesesi 02 xg per 90 27 expected assist per 90 decent underlying numbers not as good as that of james madisons who is better in both of those departments but we need to remember this is a player thats 14m cheaper than madison and playing in the exact same position so first and foremost i think its a case of is koseski better than madison no i think the answer is no i still think madison is better but when we take into account fpl value then yes i would still choose kulesi over madison i think that 14m saving that you can make is worthwhile and it would do a lot to your squad overall than just going for james madison so madisons great if you want to spend that extra you can but i think kesesi is better than him in terms of fpl saving so it comes down to kesesi versus brandon johnson and i still think brandon johnson is the man to go for yes koseski has many more avenues to points i think he could get the bonus points the assists the goals johnson is just dependent on goals but in a team like spurs who accumulating the most expected goals per game of any team i want the guy who scoring the goals and that still remains brandon johnson at 67m so johnson for me still the spurs midfielder to go for but you are riing on this spurs team clicking for him to get the returns otherwise if spurs are struggling then it comes down to individual performances and that is where madison and kulesi probably do step up because johnson is just all about getting service in this team but hey when you got madison and kesesi putting it on the plate for you i think johnson will continue to get those returns in these games coming up the big thing is it johnson or son and that is a very difficult one to answer because son gives you the captaincy option in game week 11 at home against ipswitch i dont feel that confident putting the captaincy on brandon johnson and if we do find out that son is the penalty taker then that just elevates him into another plane where i think he is clearly the better pick and probably worth the 3m more but look if you cant fit son in your team i still think brandon johnson is a fantastic alternative for your squads so last up in terms of the player comparisons i want to take a look at some attacking defenders for our teams because un conscious that a lot of managers right now im maybe taking some money out of the defense to free up the funds to maybe get to some of these premiums that we discussed im seeing some managers sell the lux of trent some people are selling robertson or some people in general are just looking at cheaper alternatives in the game so weve got exactly that weve got 8 nori at 44m we got pedr at 55m and then of course we have vardal at 61m so weve got price points at each range here depending on what direction you want to go in and when were talking about cheap defenders right now i think there are a lot available i think weve got collins at brenford we got moleno at everton but in terms of longterm fpl value i still think 8 nori is the play mikeno probably for the clean sheets but i think 8 nori when we look at the underlying numbers and i think we can see a slight improvement in wolves going forward with these fixtures under gar o nil brighton away i think is very difficult not a great entry point for 8 nory but palace at home southampton at home f him away and the fixtures get good as we continue i think 8 nori is a good player that will see his price increase as we progress through these fixtures and 021 xg per 90 is fantastic and 015 expected assist per 90 also great and you can see he outscoring the premiums in porro and vardal so when we take a look at a nori as whole i think this is a good player for you to downgrade if you have to im not sitting there saying you have to sell your liverpool defenders cuz i dont think of course eight nory is going to outscore them but if it does free up the funds for you to go elsewhere with your team i think 8 nori longterm is a great pick for this specific game week he might be a tricky play for your teams now when we take a look at the other two premiums porro and vardal porro one of those players that looks fantastic on the eye because as you can see shots per 90 20 1 so whenever you tunee into a spurs game you will seeing him taking shots taking pop shots but when we look at the underly numbers that is where its very clear these are long range pop shots hes having two shots per 90 but only 007 expected goals which indicates he is shooting from anywhere and not getting into goal scoring opportunities but end of the day we have seen the has history of scoring these worldies and i think it could continue throughout the season 013 expected assists as well is decent as well and i think that will improve in these upcoming fixures that we are seeing in terms of actual fpl points slightly unlucky 351 fpr points compared to the expected fpr points of 456 and i do think with the upcoming fixtures he could deliver a decent haul at some point either the ip switch game in particular looking like the money fixture so lastly we have vardal 61m so the biggest premium outside of the liverpool defender in trent and maybe gabrielle 013 expected goals 009 expected assists now first and foremost we need to say that this guy knows how to score bangers we talk about pedro parro vardal is in another world now vardal is a great option absolutely and i think with the game at home against southampton talk about double digit halles i think that absolutely has the potential there but bournemouth way after is proven to be a tough place to go for clean sheets then brighton away i dont like that fixture in terms of clean sheets and then spurs at home so i dont think after the southampton game there are many clean sheets a foot for gardial and nathan ai has returned we featured in the champions league game i sp still expect vel to play in gw n but we could see some rotation depending on the fixture and depending on what type of player pep wants to play so i still think viio was a great investment especially for gw nine but i feel like maybe the ship has sailed a little bit for him and i dont think you need to expect him to score every single week because they are turning out to be worldies and the underlying numbers arent amazing compared to that of even like a 8 nori for example so all in all i think 8 nori is a brilliant option to go to long term if youre looking to free up the funds pedro parro is absolutely the shortterm punt if you want to chase upside and i think vardal is great if you want to play for a safe defender but with man city still leaking goals outside of game week n9 i dont love him long term so finally we need to take a look at these gw nine predicted points because end of the day if you have earling howland you have to put the capy on him i spoke about this last week away against wolves i felt like it was probably the best captain but there still was some doubt because wolves are where you just dont know what youre getting this week if howen doesnt deliver i think we just all put our hands up and say it was the right pick just one of those game weeks because 101 predicted points i just dont think you could look past it if you dont have pand then of course the other players come into the come into their own but if you own harland how can you not put the captaincy on him so he is in another world put him in would have we buying haren the other question the answer is going to be no i dont think if you own him you should be buying him for this one specific game week because we can see a situation where they go 40 up hen scores one and comes off early so if you dont own howand i just wouldnt buy him i would just grin and barett but this week you abs absolutely have to harland captain the big question mark is do we triple captain harland because 101 predicted points i doubt were going to see much better this season outside of a double game week with double game weeks being few and far between this season which has been announced and later on this year when they do get announced are we going to see the player that we truly want getting an ideal double game week so for me if youre looking to triple captain i think this is probably the week to do so i think the fixture is too damn good 101 now we will get some midfielders who have equally good games and do i prefer captain and midfielder over harland yes i do but with the triple captain available in gw 9 with a player like harland who has such a ridiculous ceiling i think triple captain on highland absolutely needs to be considered and i think a lot of the community will do so the closer we get to that friday night deadline outside of highland then i think cole palmer is the leading one 67 i dont love the idea of a buo captain but he is looking good on the predicted points at 61 then we have the likes of ole watkins and then the man city pack in gundo vardal edison savio salah always appears on these lists so to conclude highland i think is a brilliant trible cap the option 101 predicted points is outrageous and i think he should be considered for your teams it just comes down to if youre waiting for a double game week but then you need to remember we still have a lot of chips to play with the bench boost and the mystery chip if you dont have harland then i do think cole palmer is the next best alternative for your team so thanks so much for tuning todays video hope to provided
