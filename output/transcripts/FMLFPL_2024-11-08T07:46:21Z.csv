okay welcome to frid of me life milone this walsh whats up bud chilling dog thursday night thursday night football interal break after this weekend ah boom thats bad thats bad we got so many questions because all the questions i didnt want to read last week combined with new questions didnt get answered they didnt get answered no one stepped up didnt get addressed no one stepped up for us right and then we have our teams but i well do that a bit tomorrow too on the live stream so but we need to do more than we need to do a bit on that tonight too because im im at se same someone dm me who was it was bear creeks he said im couple days late listening to the p but you said you were lost at sea what helps if youre lost that se piece of wood hes right though well lets just talk about wood we got some twoo long good wood questions vikings said regarding your discussion on wood on monday it does feel like buying yesterdays points as a nonowner weve been in these situations with almeron gundo lingard etc this level of output doesnt feel sustainable i can compare it a bit with your take on lis diaz earlier in the season red hot start you guys said it was it was going to cool off it did why would it not do the same with wood and then belo said are you still undecided on wood you both talked for a long time about hes the best striker then you say his fixures are terrible but if hes the best striker than his fixtures dont matter which is it and why havent you transferred him in yet and i feel all of those things exposed i feel youre not supposed to listen to the words we say like i dont want to hear them back thats prob stop giving theyre supposed to just go float away and never return after every pod is over i take my little men in black pen and i flash my eyes with it and i go back two hours before im like i have no idea what just happened thats the way it should be well were a couple days removed from our wood conversation and ive been ive been tinkering like im on wild card the amount ive been playing with combinations the last few days many combinations just going in out snip snap in out snip snap i where are you at today thursday i dont think that much has changed if i remember correctly where im just like hes so obvious that everything we say about not getting him is just an excuse because were sad about the points we didnt have it also just theres some bias where it never feels good to transfer in the guy that everyone else already owns and is getting points from you just feel like youre its not a bias you dont want to buy you want to buy love you dont want to buy high like youre buying high and you feel like youre a transfer behind like im just barely catching up im behind in points and im just getting the guy that you already own so it feels doubly bad that said hes cheap hes good and he has awful fixtures as bad as it gets and hes way over performing as xg how do you see him because i was trying to look more at him compared to the other strikers to me its like strand larson and wiissa still stand out to me in this sub eight million bracket wiissa has homeor think about him homeborn myth at everton home lester and then it gets a bit tougher so its just a few game we run strand lson though has all three promoted sides in the next seven game weeks with a couple of tricky away at fms going to be a tough one home bournemouths probably going to be a tough one and at everton we dont know what shape theyll look in december but then its west they have a good run for about seven games so they had the hard they had the worst fixtures to start the season so now theyre getting the reward reaping the rewards of that right and then somehow they have another murderers row again like i they just have like chunk theres no which for us is good theres no smattering of tricky one in between a couple good ones but like i still like he still keeps coming to the front of the line to me just because im looking at my team and where things have been going wrong and i feel like it is the like im not setting myself up to stockpile where i can just sit for four game week and just everythings in good shape and then i can make a big swap like where which i tried to do and i to ill effect and getting strand larsson to me looks like a pick that i can just set and forget for a good seven games and wood versus wood where im going to feel like right we keep talking about the fixtures of chasing points or were going to have the wrong side of the norm like normalizing back to the mean or whatever ever and also with like at arsenal where youre going to probably want to b like he he has these fixtures that youre just like hes probably not going to do anything in these games and its just its still its is this just a tsunami of events where wood is just gna keep w could just score 20 goals this year every season is a small sample size
