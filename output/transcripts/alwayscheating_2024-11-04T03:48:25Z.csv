hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you im all right josh slow im a little worried because its its we have we fell back brandon we in america this last night was our fallback so for us we are recording this after nine its 800 on the on the on the official clock brandon but my body clock is telling me that its 908 pm right now so we see how we how what our stamina is like as the evening goes on here i dont know if im feeling tired because we we think its later than it is or if im feeling tired just watching my rank remain exactly the same every week i ive caught up with you but well you okay like lets just get right into it then shall we because i think i i think you want we fell back into our classic patterns this week for good or for ill i have been i have been aggressive this season and it has backfired sometimes and it has worked out sometimes right and its like they theyve neutralized like depending on like where this weekends up im im probably going to be at my highest rank since game week three and that was right when i decided to take it and make an ultra aggressive wild card brandon wild card had a lot of high performers for a lot of low performers right it seemed like a good idea at the time and so ive like im like jerry seinfeld br i ive come out in the middle somehow here so you are now like its been seven weeks since then where how are you feeling you feel like youre stuck in place after 11 its not over yet theres still one i do feel stuck i can certainly easily pinpoint what the problem has been it was ive lost two weeks to phil foden and remember we did a patreon pod before like the gw nine deadline and i was contemplating chris wood and guardal in or i ended up going with moleno and phil foden which you did on the pod in time like i maybe thats a dangerous game right there is the real time transfer i dont know if you maybe you maybe you were concerned about radiance brandon and it was it was a it was like a season ending cliffhanger i will sacrifice my overall rank to get those numbers up for sure no i dont think it was a bad idea at the time foden was certainly coming back into the city squad city it cuts both ways like v space became more secure because of injuries and form became has become quite poor because in man city were about to play southampton at home right going into game week nine like its not i dont think you have to retroactively bang your head against the wall too much he also had a very good match in game week nine but better i think in nine than in 10 i havent looked at his like the underlying performance from foden it was one of i was i was watching multiple matches on sunday i saw him miss a pretty good chance i feel like it was in the first half but i assume you more closely than me so what did you think about foden well he was fine yes he didnt have as many clearcut opportunities for fantasy points than he did against southampton and city just they looked worse this week certainly they could not create any big chances and what chances they made holland chief among them it just couldnt finish them at all and holland was quite poor now i dont want to get to like morose about that transfer two weeks ago because there is always a ripple effect over the course of a month plus and so what i what where im at right now with the foden move is if i had done the gardiol wood move a couple weeks ago i would be in incredible shape right now because gardels hit in those two weeks as his wood however i wouldnt be in a position to for free this week get triple premium so now im just totally enamored of the triple premium and i would have if i have already done hs to wood and now i can for free on exact money do fod in to palmer and so now i can like im in that im heading into that gw w transfer window of just like looking at a in awe at my team which is honestly never where you want to be because thats usually when things go but i the just to finish that point i wouldnt be able to get palmer right now if i had done those other moves so its an interesting fantasy conundrum of would you trade those points for the last two weeks to get your optimal team at the moment well and were about to be i im glad you brought up the the premium situation because i think that was if there was like a big talking point in fantasy this week and one that i think i came to late i was a little reluctant to embrace it and it was it was do we just give up on holland at the moment like is there enough chaos at man city with all of the injuries we joked on the patreon pol last week about peps grumpy press conference right where he was like i dont know everyones on the everyones getting a massage right now theyre all on the train whatever ive got nine players or whatever this like once a year pep has like a press conference like this right where hes like we have no money we have no its a like he cant help it right but i its fine we all you wonder though it is positive thats peps hes communicating to his team in that moment of like im i see whats going on here and im even going to communicate through the press to you that like get it together you its not that bad so but to me its like it feels like more deus than that right its like i dont know like well see if we can scratch out a point this weekend with our with our mash unit so and they and they didnt they got seano which was pretty awesome i have been in the antoine seano fan club for well i dont know for a year right like it has beened for multiple seasons but going back to last season i thought he was he was fantastic he lost a little bit of i feel like he didnt have the spotlight last year because he was in a complimentary role to dominic salanki who also had a great season for bournemouth but sano was this right wing who was just making all sorts of things happen down the stretch for bournemouth last season and even with sank gan and evan nson coming in hes still doing that and i its interesting because its i dont know its like i dont know if im going to he may not even stay in my team because there are so many cheap midfielders and i have to decide between him and morgan rogers i think if im going to go with the with the thrum the three mum approach which im leaning towards as well by the way u at the moment i dont know i theres a couple of injuries too weve got like palmers flagged now and morgan rogers is flagged and we need to see where these guys are over the next couple days they both should be fine i me morgan rogers it was like it was like i couldnt tell if he just got kicked one too many times right because he went down once right like right around the 60th minute i remember because i was like watching the cl i was i did you start rogers this week as well i did so i was like watching the clock im like wait is he going off here too cuz it was like 5940 when he was on the ground and then he went down a second time and thats when they took him off about 10 minutes later so i think hes probably fine its like the classic knock right contact injury and i didnt even see what happened with palmer nor i played the full 90 played the full 90 but now hes hes got a flag on the site too so well see what the deal is there it could be one of these like chris wood style injuries right where chris wood it was like it seemed like he was going to be fine and he was right like in general theres like theres there are two kinds of 75 flags right theres the like seems like theyre fine should be fine and the 75 flag thats more like zero out for six months man like exactly like e like e was 75 exactly like they were 75 until the manager definitively came out and said that they were i dont know you like never see a 50 flag anymore i feel like like its its like 50 and 25 like those its our its our polarized climate now josh its its everythings very black and white either youre on one side or the other either youre injured or youre not interesting you think theres flag hurting going on like this pole hurting i keep i keep about they want everything to be 75 maybe so but anyway just to get back to the premium thing for a second because i think it was interesting and the question was i think for a lot of us we were debating between salah and holland you had salah already so it was a little easier for you to just stick with holland i would have done the same thing if i had if i had holland but not having salah and wanting to longterm make this move to have three premiums and if you want to get into that we talked about it for like a half hour on last weeks pod right so we dont think we need to rehash it go through all of it again but i think the idea is that it does seem like virtually every week theres going to be three out of four of these guys are going to deliver mhm interestingly this was the week where it was just one right it was just salah and if you had salah and you captained him he just got nine points which isnt that much but nine points with a holland blank feels huge right and so i think that was i dont think many people have no sol or holland its possible but i think most people have one of the two and so you saw i think a big contrast in returns and if you just had solent captain him that was probably enough for you to be in a gray or green arrow you and i both have i believe three players in the monday match right right i have smith row you have rul and then we both have momo and robinson so were were rooting for mass chaos in the monday night fixture i forget who did you bench to to bring you started give or you started your full did you who did you bench that you could start your fulham midfielder i ended up benching liam deap so that i could start emil smith row so when we talked on thursday night with our patreon supporters my thought was well this lester fixture is choice thats like thats grade a beef for leam deap and the more i just thought about it the more like my real just like confidence in ip switch is like fully waning and i just decided to trust that and then also go for the fun of having as many players as possible in the final fixture of the game we and also like roll with my fen boys so im thrilled that i made that choice and then i had kaa the other choice i had to make this weekend was kaa or pedro poro am i defense and i opted to bench kaa and then villa are first to score and i think yet again ive blown it i won in the end josh one point from poro instead of zero from kaa so take that as a win i know thats always the l like when you when the cona thing was like when that late goal and youre like well who does that help salanki owners but then it was like well it hurts the cona starters they lose they lose a extra point from that so i think it was interesting weekend so what i ultimately ended up doing and ill ill share my team here just that we can we can talk through it a little bit is i did end up making the move its funny i went on i went and like apologized on on our discord because i was like listen i didnt talk about this move at all on last nights pod where we talked about our moves for a half hour because i just was extremely reluctant to part ways with holland and i ultimately decided it was worthwhile to do it just because i it was the only way i could get to saka as well right and so im thinking it was like a move that was made with gw 12 in mind right which is when the fixtur finally get a little bit better for for arsenal and i think for you its its a little different because you still have a wild card to play right and so for you dont have to be thinking longterm quite its so funny im like setting myself up for all of these like perfect moves meanwhile i have a wild card where i could just do it whenever i wanted what is are you thinking you might just you might just not use it like you might just hold off and listen i just like sometimes i like to flex and hey listen i put it in the comments if you want to see brandon not play his wild card i want to hear from you so i am im on 48 on the week so far and its its i so i brought in garal and that has worked out extremely well because i was debating between garal and lewis and you could certainly make it a the case for lewis is that hes 13m cheaper and felt like he was fairly locked into the squad but h not so fast right kyle walker comes back in gets the captains armband the real life one not the fantasy one and then to make things even worse rico lewis comes on as a late sub right so youre getting the like the nightmare scenario for if youre a lewis owner whereas gardial gets clean sheet and three bonus last week and then scores a goal he like didnt even celebrate the goal like that was it was the classic like i dont even know like this is good because they were down twonil and he wanted to you get rest rolling its a hes a soldier of fortune gual hes just out there to do a job and make sure points like a hess troop in the revolutionary war branded i like it so hes a i like that lets start calling gardial the hes on this po moving for so gavard and so but i did i dropped holland for raul i considered salanki that was the algo recommended move in brandon score one for the alos because in the first in the first half of that spurs match i was like see no salani this is like this is this is smart this is wise like us man exactly humans went im watching these games okay i know not to get salani like smash cut to the end of the match where hes got two goals and an assist u and looked great too like a totally completely different player and he ends up 16 points so r no pressure tomorrow just outscore dominic sanki 16 points and will be good but so rogers came through that with nine jamie vy who lowkey has been fine like totally fine as a as a as my cheap forward i got five points from him this week a nice assist too in the iu goal and jordan iio by the way just hanging around like hes hes gonna be like danny wellb back youre just 17 seasons in hes still gonna be getting minutes for these squads not necessarily a starter anymore but he can like he can come he can come in and do a job like this is his second sub appearance goal in two matches so so but i got a an assist from bardy got a goal and two bonus last week and a goal the week before that so you perfectly respectable returns for a sub6 million forward and watkins blanks and i think thats looking ahead to gw 11 i think thats where my brain is and i have to say brandon i did not think id be doing this on the pop but i also didnt think id be dropping holland last week so watkins to dominic salanki looms as a possible game week 11 transfer whats your watkins is about to price drop in the next hour while we pod do you have do you have room wiggle room there he rose in price after i bought him so hes at n i bought him at 9 hes at 91 now so it would just it wouldnt matter and so watkins to salanki spurs play i switch in gw 11 makes some logical sense id like to wait a couple of days to do it if i could because they do have a europa league match on thursday so ideally i would i would wait until after that well see how the price changes i would probably take one point1 change like another one on the chin i dont know if id take two right and so and so but i think that would feel like a fairly logical move i also have because i made this holland switch and br and salah it freed up like something like three million if i do watkins to salani that would give me enough mo enough money to move either sano or rogers to saka in gw 12 so it like the moves almost pick themselves i feel like right barring any serious injuries i think that feels like a pretty logical move for gw 11 is just boom watkins to salani right target tot home match great fixture and the fixtures coming up for spurs too are enticing some people will be thrown off by the man city away fixture in gw 12 theyve got two home pictures with ip switch and fulam on either side followed by bourne myth like a salanki return home thats just got narrative written all over it thats true its like it could go could go either way right its like a non celebration i feel like no matter what right and then the two f the two tough matches following that chelsea and then liverpool with southampton those two tough matches are both at home for spurs so i feel like theyre going to take a ton of confidence from this villa result this weekend after like going through a rough patch feels like a good time to have spurs assets and what do you i know neither of us have been and i should say we have not been super high on spurs salanki i think you and i were both big fans of bournemouth salan right and so it just hasnt quite he hadnt quite clicked for spurs had some injuries also hadnt shown a particularly high ceiling right for spurs so far and does one half wipe all that away like what do you think about now todays match i dont how could it cant possibly like what weve seen of solank at spurs beyond that one half has been mr back to goal scarce scant chances but it could just be as simple as playing more expansive ambitious team like aston villa to open up the play a little bit more there was a little bit more space on the wings and that just favored salanki so it just he could just be a fixture player perhaps but just looking at the way managers are jumping having held kept the faith with salanki hes absolutely an asset to continue keeping the faith with just given like if its working for spurs its going to work a lot and his ceiling is like so i think what we discovered this weekend is sanis ceiling is a lot higher than we would have thought and its its still unclear what floor is and i think its its his price is low enough that you dont have to move everything right you dont have to completely shift your team around to bring him in and so i do think hes i hate to be like the prisoner of the moment like this but i dont know when a when a forward scores a brace and has one of the worst defenses at home in the next match its those moves are pretty simple sometimes right like you dont have to overthink it too much and then the question is just do you wait until friday to make the move or you just go ahead and pull the trigger early so did you say you already made your moves for game week 11 or well i did not make a transfer heading into this weekend so i have two free and ive already moved hts to wood because i have exact money to do this move to do hts to wood and fod in to cole palmer okay so ive done one half of it to catch the chriswood price rise and now i have 01 to give on foden but i cant okay manage the price for as im palmer so im just watching that and i will theres theres no real sense of me waiting too long if theres news about palmers fitness and of course bb in the youtube chat made a good point it was that martinez challenge at the end of the man utd match where he caught palmer on the knee and hes fine then i me he like played the rest he like had a chance shortly after that so i think its fine right so theres no reason for me to hold off because co p wont be playing midweek cuz hes not on the chelsea team sheet for europa just yet so anyway those what is phil foden gonna do in the champions league to make me be like wow ive got a hold of him seeing de bruyne on the bench for man city with like fodens got to go like immediately now i dont even know if hes even going to play nor is there any reason to keep him and an arsenal fixture for chelsea its tough arsenal have a good defense but what a great time to play arsenal like arsenal were like in like severe i dont want to be around anymore mode this weekend and i think cole palmer just he clearly doesnt care who hes playing i think hes playing well he had a a downbeat match against man utd but it ended up being a tricky match i think just because of the the manager change right i think i the united players were up for it for sure they were up for it exactly and i think that changed things a little bit he had he could have had an assist right so it just it wasnt quite his day but i think that match for me i traditionally think of that especially i dont know seems like especially when man united host chelsea that match always i know its like the most they were saying today that in the todays broadcast that its the most drawn match in the premier league and that squares up with my own memory it does feel like every time man united host chelsea it is like a 11 or nilnil draw and im im not quite sure why that is but lets lets lets lets go back just for a moment to the beginning of game week 10 because arsenal did stumble again they played away to newcastle probably played their strongest match of the season so far and another tough match for all arsenal assets right you hts with a onepointer saka blanked defense concedes a goal i think it was like the 12th or 15th minute i cant when eso scored fairly early in the game and and then that was it right it was i dont know like i just like its a tri i still feel like its going to turn around like i and i i at this point im almost thinking more like in terms of fantasy results than i am like the actual team like i we got our old arsenal back josh where theyre playing for fourth place again and we love it such a no i dont love it i hate it however who would have thought like the story this season was going to be like i to me it was like arsenal are finally there like theyre finally g to push through and then it like liverpool are like the not so fast like maybe well just steal this title and with man city losing today it like its its very open still clearly right like its its its i in my head i thought man city had already lost i was surprised when i read that it was their first loss of the season like they just had a couple of theyve had these like the draw with arsenal the late win over world have we been so have we been so warped by like the last fiveish years where you can only win the title if youre undefeated like there were barclays the barclays era of the premier league has been in the air this season and lets go back where you can lose like five matches and still win the title thats exciting thats cool i think its cool too like i hope we have a threeway or more race i think that would be awesome the other cool story was there were a couple questions too about forest but forest in third place which i think is so cool like its i think its its just fun like even fantasy aside its its just always like every year theres one team like last year it was villa right and i dont know that i gen genely think that forest could get a champions league spot but i think that theyre they could they sneak into like a europa league spot maybe they have a they have a strong defense they have some callum hudson they have players like callum hudson andoy who like are like highly pedigreed players right who battled injury and for there was a time a few years ago i dont remember this when chelsea were fending off bayern munich who were making a big push for callum hutson m so then he had this like it was like he was trying to get into that break into that squad and like i was like like lets make him left wing back hudson ao right it was like they were like trying everything to make it work and i just wonder if that screwed with him a little bit its like a its like a like a baseball hitter who theyre like like you should change your swing right so that you can hit more home runs like change your launch angle right and then suddenly its like they cant they cant do anything anymore and i just wonder and last year he battled injuries on and off too what what also screws with your confidence when your club buys 20 other left wingers right exactly my god and i thought enzo was bad today also enzo i dont know what its like the way he color like his haircut now he looks like cole palmer on the pitch its annoying to me like i was trying to like maybe my tv just isnt big enough fernandez looks like no i dont in general no cole palmer is possibly the most distinctive looking person in the premier league but for some reason when they were today there were like three or four times when i thought that i thought it was cole palmer and then i was like thats enzo with the ball so i think he i think hes you got like a different haircut so are you thinking of the right like enzo fernandez came on like as a substitute very la late in the match who knows does he have blonde hair now am i am i am i like totally wrong about this im going to do a google image search for the last 24 hours prob i genuinely can are you confusing him with rasmuss holand perhaps no im not i dont know well solve this mystery maybe who maybe i thinking of somebody else i dont know like well im going to do some di baff well find well figure this out so but on forest you so you brought in chris wood ana who youve been like he i know i jokingly often say this but like he is your boy this season like youve been youve been big uping him all year and so he he gets the goal i think he ended up with three bonus points as well in the match so their defense looks strong midfield i dont know morgan gibs whites in battling some injuries and so its hard to recommend him but hudson adoy has sneakily been pretty good this season and let me see just let me pull him up real quick here as were as were talking hes now the top midfielder for forest hes got its just its just two goals and one assist so its not like mindblowing but i dont know i just feel like the way theyre clicking right now there might be some interesting options there maybe its it honestly might just be wood and anar the only two you want to consider although sells as a as the as a cheap keeper like if i could go back and do my wild card again and in fact when you wild card brandon i think ss would have to be someone youd consider right hes 46m ill take anyone like its the first goalkeeper to get in line like you play that game when youre a kid like last one to get your knee like that it right first goalkeeper the touch and knee is my goalkeeper hes got hes racked up an assist so far this season hes got four clean sheets lets see hes got six bonus points he honestly he probably been one of the one of the better cheap keepers that you could have this season so im up on forest im rooting for them i also like their red color brandon i maybe just like red squads but i think aesthetically theyre like a fun squad like theyre fun squad to watch in this year i think in general i like to watch most of the teams in the premier league this year like outside of southampton i feel like the thing about lester like in its like youre talking about like benching dap for that match and i do get it because theyre not exactly pushovers like they dont they concede goals but like every match they play is like so unpredictable its like you dont know its a little bit like what you that feel you get when youre in a fpl headtohead league and you have to play average that week i feel like when you play lester this season its like going against the fpl average youre like i should win this like but i dont know but i dont know and im going to lose more than i expect yep so so i think i dont know i think that like theyre theyre theyre an interesting team im just going to hold vardy by the way for a while like i dont i dont see any reason to like if could make an easy move to wood at some point ill do it but otherwise like how much does cost these days hes like 56 something like that nothing right so im not i wouldnt even necessarily recommend buying him like they play away to man united in game 11 but all right so like im just moving through my little my talking points for todays match brandon what did you think about gardial by the way hes 62m so hes very pricey in general we have not been getting a lot from keepers this season but bonus in the last match goal theres something about the left back spot for man city it does seem to be a spot where i think maybe especially with kyle walker when he plays right because hes so strong defensively that maybe that is a spot where you could get a little bit more like he to me hes probably the second and maybe honest the only the one other player you can have on man city right now outside of outside of holland right its its a mess otherwise it is hes a strange fantasy ass at guardio because you are relying on him getting attacking returns because i thought he had a poor defensive match and just city nothing needs to be said beyond theyve been horrible defensively all season but he but he has this pension for popping up and getting attacking returns and its like how much are you willing to spend cu he doesnt get attacking returns the way a lot of fullbacks do like the trent alexanders arnold of the world like hes never hes i dont think ive ever seen vardal cross the ball but hes certainly looking to get on the end of a onew or on the end of a cross so i like him for that right hes more of a goalscoring fullback than a like hes not hes not andy robertson right hes got like a very different hes a sheamus coleman we could say hes hes mores hes more a sheamus coleman than a leighton baines okay well if he was on pens maybe he could be a he could be a b why not why not why not so lets see hes got on the season safari hes got three goals in no assists those three goals have come in the last five matches so hes hes like i dont know i dont know like i statistically i dont know how to like talk about streakiness or whatever but he has been a very streaky asset in fantasy we saw this last season as well right where he put in a lot of good performan like he pass the eye test right like you when you watched him in these man city matches it was like wow this guy is like all over the ball hes getting hugely advanced positions like and but it but he also had this run of 10 plus matches like that like last season where he just got no attacking returns right just nothing and he was expensive and this season the same way the first five weeks of the season no goals and no assists and now hes got three goals in his last five with a u a clean sheet and three bonus thrown in as well right and the three bonus comes at least a little bit from the threat that he was providing right on the the like you said i dont i r like much like trent im rarely impressed with his defensive capab it was weird in the liverpool match there was some moment where trent like gave the ball away in a bad spot and the announcers were like unusual for tren i was like i dont think so thats what you pay for so i think with guial hes the fantasy asset that you stumble backwards into like in just in the right game we it feels right and you go for it i cant see any like grander plan involving guardal like why you would like he would be a part of a team you were you were constructing over the course of a month that a thing because i think where were at right now is like trying to get as much extract as much money out of our defense as possible because theres no real value there now you have and trent at this point whats the deal there its not going to last and but i think at the moment it is tricky because one of the other talking points this week was that we had these great performances from the popular cheap midfielders right rogers with a goal and two bonus sano a goal and three bonus even brennan johnson came through with a goal and its it feels like a little polarized in terms of like youre getting returns from the five million guys and the 12m guys and its like you dont want to have like a 9m midfielder right like or even like a nine million forward like i ive had watkins the last few weeks and hes been hugely disappointing right and it feels like hes foden hes my foden exactly hes my hes my rushmore brandon and so thats thats what thats whats happening with me right now i thought brennan johnson hes like talk about a player who passed the eye test he he does look good in these matches and probably overdue to get a goal and he plays he plays leaf davis next week who loves getting roasted on brennan johnsons side talk about lea davis the poor mans gardial right with the hes normally more of an assist guy than a goal scorer but like hes hes no ones hes no ones idea of a great defensive player but he just gets it was awesome i know i felt a little bad for them conceding because are they still without a win on the season too i believe so yes and southampton did pick up their first win too a a close one with that i that offside decision was tight i dont know if you saw the meleno just getting robbed of fpl points people always complain about so theres all this like esoteric fantasy crap like bonus point systems and and like where am i holding midfielder points what i hate i hate the fact that you get clean sheet points only to have them taken away and that just doesnt it makes everyone feel bad okay thats true they shouldnt award the clean sheet points till the game is over thats a good thats thats true because i hate i hate logging into my team when theres a clean sheet in there right i dont even like to cing yourself i thought you meant he had supplied the assist for the the bet no i just wanted some clean i just wanted some points was that so much to ask it was it was so much to it was too much to ask all right well lets okay one final thing here brandon which is man united assets we get the the bruno pen we also got a holand assist right he earned the pen some clowny goalkeeping from sanchez as i thought on that on that particular play you just cannot touch the player right like thats of course hes going to dive like every you and i would dive if like a goalkeeper touches your feet you have to fall over if youre in the box thats just what you do right and so but like defensively they were i thought they were okay like they like you said they were they were up for this match and it took a a screamer right a great goal from outside the box for them to even concede anything in this match so did you come away like slightly more interested in any man united assets or did you think it was all just a well the their defense was more impressive mazari was the player who i liked the most in the match and my main issue with man utd was i thought their attack was pretty blunt and not great like garnacho was i think easily the worst player on the pitch which like i its one match and you would want to be very optimistic as a man utd supporter that things are going in the right direction and garnacho is allowed to have a bad match would i would i bank on garnacho over marcus rashford at this point probably but still it was like holand rashford garnacho i was like well this is like i dont know how far you can go with these three guys up front it feels like bruno and mai were the guys who impressed me the most could you could you is onana going to beat cells to the punch in my goalkeeping wild card position its their next their next i wonder if you end up talking yourself into an early wild card here brandon honestly because the trio of matches coming up for man united are probably as good as it gets right they have lester at home in gw 11 ip switch away in gw 12 and everton at home in game league 13 so its its a trio of strong matches i think i dont know its like maybe its not your particular squad brandon but like just because im talking to you like but i think like someone out there if they want to be a little bit different this probably for the first time this season br ill say this but this might be the time to get bruno and just and just take a punt and see if he can deliver for you because the like the chance of a like extreme return from him is never going to be higher than it is in the next three weeks right like a high ceiling return like either lester at home it such a way again like theyre unpredictable like lester especially but but unpredictability can be good in fantasy 2 right like you could see a bunch of goals from both squads in this match so i dont know its like i do think that gar i dont know like garnacho maybe holand im still i feel like the still out i dont quite believe it yet but i dont know and then you have xery come on and im like im always like i forget hes there right im like like xery which is a i always want to say i always want to say xerxes by the way too like the old the old emperor ruler its like a anent babylon or whatever right well i dont think you have to spend too much time thinking about

and take a look at gw 11 all right so game week 11 and i will share of course well talk through it but ill share it just so you and i can be on the same page we can so we can read from the same prayer book as you like to say yes love to say that and so this is the final game week before the next international break i know you are hoping it would come sooner brandon but dont worry youve got you got one coming were almost there its they jam them in and im im also sad to tell you this is the last international break i believe until march so its a nice i know exactly everybody so are your what is international champions cup head whatever they call this the nations league the nations league i cant keep up with any of these things anymore brandon they get rebranded all the time and its you can tell how i feel about them just from that expression there so i they do get i will say the international breaks get better when you have stuff like world cup qualifying thrown into the mix right i think that does raise the stakes a little bit but when its just like friendlies its hard for me to stay who cares who bloody cares exactly so all right so anyway game week 11 so we have matches just on saturday and sunday its your classic post champ chs league europa league split bunch of matches are on sunday so of course that is a reminder that on tuesday and wednesday we have champions league games all we games on thursday involving i think six premier league squads play at midweek so if you can hold off on your transfers unless youre tight on budget i would i would try to do so we saw just this last week with the with the league cup right which in theory should be less of a like lift but the league cup there were a bunch of people knocked out from that as a as a among them so i think that its its an interesting slate of fixtures though the one that as i talked about the beginning of the pod that stands out to me is that spurs ipss switch match and for me i just dont have anybody for that match right now and that feels like the one where i could its a little bit like the arsenal southampton match several weeks ago where i was like well maybe i can just maybe i can just skate by well i dont i have one defender of that ill just ill just skate by and itll be fine like how bad could it be not having saka or you anybody else in that game it was terrible it was like a it was a upended my season in some ways right i took a massive hit and so i that is the one where im like i feel like i want to get into that into that attack if i can and so i am looking at salanki for that one lets see southampton wolves saw south southampton the other squad where youre you want to target your fixtur if you can and i will say again st larson continues to put in some nice performances if they i i dont find wolves to be trustworthy at all i certainly wouldnt recommend bringing in any of their assets at the moment but theyre at least like back in the conversation of getting like theyre more fantasy relevant than west ham at this point brandon so thats thats something why west ham persisting with this la pegy its its funny like at least oneal at wolver hampton like theres some theres i dont know theres no point im talking about either these teams but like wolves is the bandwagon in fpl right now cia and larson are the main guys and as well so lots of fun cheap guys to choose from where west ham like the players you might want to pick up like bowen are just like too expensive for what youre getting for that team so i get it but i agree like wolves just dont like theyre just because the fixtures turned doesnt mean theyre suddenly a good outfit and i think they have so much still to prove and you dont have that one asset that like like quang chan last season like what they do is score goals i think may there may be they may be one of the teams thats like never theyve theyve scored in every match so far this season like lets lets see lets look at their matches scored scor sc scored they had scored in every match so like goals is what youre trying goals and assists is what youre trying to buy unfortunately they canc it roughly a 2 one ratio i was thinking and i know this isnt super fantasy relevant either but i just because its on my mind i was thinking watching that because that was the aral failed to score against them anyway sorry go ahead nine out of 10 then but it was the fe the featured match for some reason on saturday was this w wolves palace game and so i was watching it and i was thinking about whether because both the gos they were just like theyre so shaggy defensively and its like and i was wondering im like is that on oneal and if so if it if it is on him like you like you have to sack him right its like or its like or its like a talent thing but its like if you thought that he was at fault for it theyve been so bad defensively that he would have to go like i so i feel like its not like im saying that because i dont know that it is him but its like its feels weird that theyre so poor defensively yes you would think that yes the manager might be able to turn the screws there tighten it up a bit and its being sacrificed but maybe the club just says our only ambition this season given the circumstances of 17th place and right just given like how much it would cost us to sack oneal and we probably wouldnt get any like anybody remarkably better give him give him like a this good fixture run like i expect if wolves are still like firmly in the relegation zone after this run through like the end of the year then hell be sacked for sure i think so too and im not advocating for sacking him i think i think in general these squads probably move a little too quickly to sack these guys but so anyway well i think we have an we have an interesting slate on saturday and sunday a very late match on saturday i love when they do this theyve been doing these a little more often brandon and late game liverpool hosting aston villa i dont know what to think about aston ville anymore its its a real like i hate i hate this cliche but its like tale of two halves situation right like first half its they look scoring a set piece look pretty strong defensively second half they caned four and im like i dont know quite what to make of them right now i think theyve been bit by the same bug is newcastle when they got to the champions league that and also just like the learning curve to be fighting on those fronts and the onana coming into the midfield in place of douglas louise i think is like its a good signing but i just dont think its clicked fully and i think that does weaken their just like what theyre trying to do transitionally and he went off as well didnt he or maybe he just got hurt i cant remember if he went off in the match in the end hold on im pulling up the match tracks because i dont i dont recall as well i have rogers off injured no onana stayed on the pitch the entire time okay he did because i remember at one point he got like walloped by somebody but and so i think that should be a fun match though regardless im looking forward to liverpool villa its i have i dont know like do you think that youll captain salah this week again its between salah and alland theres theres no great science to it salah is my bus team captain but brighton there are there are reasons why we used salah to target brighton this week they have injuries and they do play very open so can holland just like pull the finger out can start finishing some chances if so because i dont know the big brain way of thinking of holland right now is wow maybe hes an edge to like be the last person who has faith enough to captain holland so i dont hate the brighten away fixture for holland and as youre saying like i also do not hate borderline i like the home fixture against villa fala i think that makes sense and like how different is this conversation of holland just converts that massive chance he has late in the bouth match id probably like c defin i id definitely be bus team holland all the way in that situation for sure it just it feels like its like reflective though of a little bit of its like its on the one hand sure its unlucky and the other hand its like reflective of him just not hes just not smashing the ball the way he does when hes like in good form right and fill confidence the chances just arent that good and theres theres just too many crosses that hes being asked to convert cuz hes terrible in the air unless like hes unless hes doing like a scissor kick like there is just not enough space for holland and i think that this is why another reason to just get rid of foden asap because de bruyne is seems crucial to help holland find that space theres something about i dont know if its something to do with rerie not being there like that but its like i feel like the holland thrives and i think kdb and rodri have both been good at finding him in these spaces where like hes like halfway in between the center circle and the opposition goal right and its like if you can get him in the ball with space like in that in that area he is so good i feel like driving forward and using his speed and i feel like but the way the matches have been going and i im maybe its just because the ball is getting more clogged up midfield and so the other team isnt comm committing as many players forward and so theyre able to get back and stop these stop these chances im not sure but well so you just have the ball all the time third doing nothing just they have the ball all the time and theyre scoring like a goal a game its like its its its so its just not and so he just hes in the box constantly right and just like its like he turns into like some tony pus forward right just like waiting for something to that he can put his head on right and like thats i dont i agree that hes hes not thriving in this current role so but with that said i think i agree i think its like its pretty close between holland and salah other salanki as a captain see feels a little like a little too like what have you done for me lately son i wouldnt mind if you had sun in your squad i think sun if a i just feel like i all these memories over the years of sun captain sun for these like easy fixtures and him like not because he is so good on the counterattack right and hes so good at like converting these low xg chances and soon as i feel like when theyre playing a team that theyre just like clearly better than its it doesnt suit his you just gave me a great idea like all these optimal stats and predictive models for fantasy i want a model thats just sh cheely based on your memory hey how about how about this for an idea by the way this is not related to what you just said but why dont you why dont you use this other transfer to bring in sun this week and then wild card in gw 12 why dont you have sun for this for the if switch fixture and then like like plan to dead end your team and wild card into the next game week i game week 12 is already good time to wild card anyway so thats thats an interesting idea not convinced that sun is a worthwhile fantasy asset i did just outline all the reasons not to necess but im just saying like its its an interesting strategy i think that there is some like it could work right because sure and gw 12 over the international break is a fantastic time to wild card because arsenal do have that huge fixture turn and cole palmer becomes like even more like his fixture are more enhanced as well so lots of different teams that you want to jump on so i dont hate treating game we 11 as like a wild punt a game w i get it especially because i dont i dont think that palmer is like super essential for game 11 anyway right because even with arsenal flailing a little bit i dont see chelsea scoring like three goals in this match right i think its going to be he they may score one and he scores that goal but i just dont see it as like a like a wideopen game maybe im wrong about that but i dont know what to make of it either i think its gna resemble a lot of what we saw in the chelsea man utd match today i think it might look pretty similar to that and then i thought chelsea just like didnt call upon their attacking prowess enough which it was odd like they just didnt show what they could do nicholas jackson was like incredibly anonymous until i realized he got a yellow card and im just like how does this guy always somehow find a way to get a yellow card even when you dont even see him on the pitch its very funny to me but i dont know but having foden going into gw 11 also feels like and these just like bitter tears of foden just being a complete dud the last couple of weeks does feel like like hes a waste of a spot in a fantasy squad for one week and that does feel way too passive for me like yes as you say like foden could doesnt have to become palmer he could become anyone playing these fixtures he could become brennan johnson for that matter right lets see who are the who would be like the other plum fixture like southampton who do i it would probably be lina whats that l bring in lamina mario jr as hes now called on the website its mario jr honestly like you could you could look at bruno as a again it just it just sort interesting brun like i think theres like a quite good chance he gets some attacking return in that lester match so again its its a luxury for you a little bit just because you have this wild card that you could maybe punt and maybe try to get one up on other managers right like thats the advantage of having that wild card still as you can you can always and also they play if switch in 12 so it doesnt you wouldnt you wouldnt be dead ending with him so i dont know its an interesting thought well then thats another reason for me to just like punt on the wild card bring in bruno and i dont play the wild card as we all know bruno fernandez solves all fantasy problems always has always will all right we got a couple questions here brandon sure lets get into them i think i have i have two questions that ive selected one is from fpl brooklyn arsenal have just not been clicking offensively or defensively should we stick for their gw 12 fixture swing so this is the this is a key question i think at this point its interesting i thought their lineup against newcastle was pretty solid bar acknowledging that odard is out right theyre defense was there were lots of injury concerns and i thought they had a pretty strong defense that they lined up with so its like its not a personnel issue there just seems to be a real mental block and thats the thing thats the root of the question is do good fixtures help even the most depressed team and arsenal seem depressed i think the answer is yes like for the record i do think that like defensiv ly thats the thing thats like giv me a little bit of pause they like theyre certainly like their numbers are still fine defensively but it does feel like i dont its just a weird time with them because you dont have that like one and thats what like if youre if youre like okay like just to look at the whole team saka yes like i think that saka is fine regardless of fixture we saw that last week too right game week game week nine and like he had one blank and newcastle away its always a tricky fixture especially whatever reason for arsenal right theres just like these certain i dont know why theres certain squads that just seem to struggle with certain teams right its like it feels like for a long time it was like man city and crystal palace had this like weird but when arsenal go to newcastle is just always a tough match and so it seems like newcastle are like especially up for it and so i think long term hes still a buy i think you could buy him as soon as soon as this chelsea match and itd be fine defensively though i think it is a little bit trickier because you its just its gabrielle right and thats it like at this point i wouldnt rebi celba i dont think thats i will long term like i think hes fine but like i would i would go gabriel first if i was going that way but again its just like they dont feel super solid at the moment and theyre conceeding a lot of goals and so youre like bringing him in the hopes that you get like they get a bunch of set pieces right and he can like get his head on one which is which is like a an argument for him like for sure like im not diminishing that but i dont know its like outside of saka theres no one id be excited to bring in right now theyre theyre the man city defense right now is they will they will make one or two huge mistakes this arsenal defense a match at this point and i theres theres something going on there and hs h saka i think are they will get their points a huge concern with the arsenal attack is just like how bad trer and martinelli have been just last couple weeks like trossard in particular this weekend was quite poor but theres just no magic anywhere else in the team right now in the midfield like r rice and god can moreno remember that gu name theres just not a huge amount of dynamism in that partnership yet i think there will be this is like this arsenal team is built for next season as far as im concerned well its just like i there was like at some moment when like it was like dean rice like does his best to try to create a goal by himself and im like is this like a problem is this like an actual problem that needs to get solved at this point which is that delan rice like doesnt want to be a defensive midfielder anymore and its like is this like is there a connection its a great player but its like setp delivery was complete was horrible against newcastle im just like are could they be creating better chances if he wasnt like soloing it where hes like im gonna run in im gonna be like vintage yaya tor and im just hes not doing thats just commentators loving like the the handsome pristine looking englishman irishman maybe so i feel like i feel like im like im seeing a little too much of it myself but i dont know i just i just i somethings going on with the defense and im not quite or maybe its just i dont know its only 10 weeks right its its still a cliche alert here brandon but its still a small sample right like i think i think by the second half of the season man city and arsenal will have figured it out and well be seeing a bunch of one nil and twonil matches right i think thats thats thats whats coming so for better or worse for worse that whats whats fun about that long as liverpool continue winning then youve got theres theres the drama absolutely theyll be drama like in terms of the table but i just mean like i do feel like weve seen the last couple years a bunch of these matches where its like they have you have two highly motivated teams playing a bunch of teams that like are locked into their spot right and so its just like one nil two n one n two n i gota all right last questions from neymar butland brandon he says this is more of an existential question at what point do you stop and ask yourself the question what is my team i feel as though ive been following so many pieces of advice and adding so many random players who im not sure about or not watch play with my own eyes yes i want to make fantasy fun again yes but i also want to make my own team my team again 100 how do i do that the answer is quite evident i think is you have to stop all non always cheating content seeking advice taking advice looking at other peoples team the whole the whole when fantasy content and discussion is at its best and its something we strive for we dont always achieve is what lets talk about fantasy in terms of how much did you have a good week a bad week did you watch any matches was it cool i dont want your excels okay i dont i dont this isnt not like a this is not meant to spirited rant baseball was better before moneyball like anyway this i know what you mean though this question resonates with me because i find myself in this position all the time like foden just to he is like my example for everything on this episode that was a decision that i made without necessarily look looking at for advice or consulting any tables or anything like that like i did it was all me and still when i look at my team right now theres something about the aura that it puts out that doesnt feel like something that i necessarily wanted or missing a six million goalkeeper is right come on you got to if thats your calling card you got to honor its like the who are the water bandits or who are the guys in home alone the wet bandits the wet bandits they had the argument like we cant turn the water on because thats how theyll catch us and hes like no but we got to have a calling card so even if its like is to your detri to be fair joe pesi who didnt want to do that was validated in the end right cuz they said we found all these we have all these other crimes where they did the thing so now we can retroactively its fine that character did get his come up in the hit movie cin which we talked about last week i think cra what they did to the wet bandits in that cornfield thats true daniel stern hes in the you cant see him but he goes into that he goes into that shallow grave first i think that would be incredible if it was part of cino was part of the home alone universe came out on the same time its very possible but like i think its i think youve got to make sure that there is your dna in your team otherwise youre 100 g to be not going to have fun unless youre like winning the fpl and thats thats hard thats how tight rope i think you just this was me a year or two ago and the answer is you just have to drastically reduce your amount of consumption i think of fantasy content again i hope you continue to listen to this podcast if youre an hour in then you then i think youre a youre a fan or a supporter or whatever but like theres a lot of like i just dont spend time on twitter anymore that was the way that i saw this right like i just i was just on there too much i was watching too many teams and i it just gets in your head and then its its honestly like theres a bit of like fear of missing out right youre just like ah man like everybodys going for this player if he if he delivers and and im on here all day on saturday or whatever im just going to be kicking myself and feeling like a the biggest idiot for not doing that but if youre not on these spaces all day then that stuff cant hurt you right and and so i think thats you can go the other way and be like like when they when they dont do well i get to have shoden for it or whatever but like thats not like the greatest emotion either right like its its its not like the healthiest way to be like im just like playing to root against people or whatever right so its like better to just like again this is like a the big themee for this year but its like focus on your mini leagues like like focus on that worry about that world and then its like what are the what are the people in your mini leagues what do their squads look like right like maybe youve got to be the one who sends the email every week or gets the the mini league mate dossier and distributes it right like the way you do brandon twice you do it for two different leagues i love i love my mini league mates exactly and its like so like invest in that stuff and then i think it doesnt matter so much like you wont worry so much about whether you have like the right players or the right template or whatever practically speaking though how do you make sure you have good players you like who are still good fantasy assets so its all well and good to say well just fill your team with guys you like and thats how you end up with like adam wharton in your team i think like youve got to use like well you have to like you have to be like a little bit of strategically smart about some of this stuff right and you got to have some common sense and i think i will say though that even though ive reduced my consumption im still i you i have two different like fpl review which we talked about in this podcast before and ml tum these like services where they just like produce numbers right and believe me like i am not just like picking the stuff thats thats thats generated from there nor are you right we certainly talk about them and theyre interesting but that at least always gives me a but like listen like theyve had bruno has been at the top of these charts for like 10 weeks right so like clearly like it is not for like months for so long as well right just has been doing nothing he got an assist last week and so but there that at least i think gives you like a little baseline right like the mel talk thing i think its like 199 right its like nothing and then you like and then you can at least like pull up a little data chart be like okay because its like a like okay i see like maybe i should look at these five players just because theyre all at the top of the chart and they werent necessarily on my radar and then you look and youre like ah right its like its like man united right where youre like i didnt realize they played lester if switch and everton the next three right and so maybe i should be considering them more seriously stuff like that for sure all right you can do this i think by christmas your team will have a little bit more flavor im sure of it neymar butland also change your change your fantasy team name to neymar butland fc i think that sound sounds a bit like leroy jenkins doesnt it leroy chickens si all right brandon lets wrap things up here thank you so much for listening i am feeling by the way that fall forward all of a sudden its hit me like a like a like a brick just one brick not a ton of bricks but one big bri like a huge brick and cant be a loadbearing
