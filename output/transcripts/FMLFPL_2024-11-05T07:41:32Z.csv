i was a single dad today to clear some work meetings that was regrettable and do everything all by my lone some so were doing it though hard life but were getting through it were going were going my moms coming out on thursday shes been good lately dude shes not saing enough for thanksgiving shes just coming now she never comes for she comes for christmas but shes been chilling lately love know whats going on maybe shes having like an end of life antiisis and shes just like finding the peace and the calm i dont know whats going on over there but shes been sh ill take it take its like dont touch anything try and not disrupt anything thats good thats happening dont poke anything just see if it keeps going so got that what about you over there hows it going hows new york everythings good new yorks good great weather right now i love the weather right nows back sharons back between 50s 60s sunny just like nice fall weather enjoying that itll be cold soon that wont be as nice winters coming winters always coming winter may have came for my f team unfortunately winters the only thing that came i didnt come no well im still waiting for the game to update cuz my seeno 10 is and my dibling zero is somethings going on there i have a seu 10 of my own right here my you dont have any zeros to auto sub i have a zero it just hasnt registered yet theyll fix that ill have to write a letter 33 points for team milan patrick ying do you remember numbers via sports i know every number of every player like i have my current fpl id is ray lewis sha to thats just how i remember every number im just like two you gotta put someone on there well whos number two in sports i dont know singled digit numbers like across all sports or like whos a famous number two because i dont i only know sports where the numers very prominent like i dont know baseball numbers that much because you just see the players face you dont know the first name that comes to mind for me is lj larry johnson easy two okay probably the best two of all time i think he switched later to like 24 but when he was on our team he was number two love that dont love my score another huge red arrow i just one return rogers only return except for seeno third on my bonus point palmer bath and aumo clean were my other returns so the other players were two one two lot of tw pretty bad its just like how the am i how can you pick 14 out of 15 idiot who cant get a single goddamn return like it seems when you think about it harder to pick 11 starters who get one or fewer returns its definitely it is to pick 11 started to get more than that if you just gave yourself the a pool of pick 11 players from these 45 players insane it would be difficult to get a grouping of them where you get one or less returns one or less its its insane cannot rest rico rico doesnt it doesnt matter if he played he gets two points anyway they suck but palmer we both captain palmer hes flagged now because lassandro red carded him but didnt get a red card everythings a disaster leandro is problematic hes hes a pig i hate that fu hes real hes hes a real high level scummer the two like dirty arguably dirtiest players in the league romero and leandro both had their red card moments this week romero managed to injure himself which made it feel a little bit better love to see that because its just like our ball dont lie moment its like you deserve to be injured nether got a red card leandros something i feel like romeros been a little bit better got there i think he hasnt thrown as many leg breakers as he used to under the previous regimes but leandro martinez is just a is a disgusting person but so is my team all right but your teams a little bit better because my team is the same as your team i just had salanki so i got 45 pulling up trees in a week where most people struggled to hit four i was a few points above the average but i was in all sorts go at like i was putting in minus i was putting in minus 16s and you were done sunday happened and i get the points and and rogers got points and i was like okay maybe i wont take a minus 16 this week i still might i still might do something to feel something but it just feels like its im feel like im walking in quicksand and im just not moving and nothings nothings fun and its just a real slog and drudgery we both save i got a massive red arrow you got a gray arrow but it does feel like what the are we doing like no i went down dont dont twist it you went down 20k i feel like that is a gray at this stage my fpl page is showing a red circle with a white chevron on its a red nice chevron name drop but no big deal well neither of us went for mo neither of us did the like aggressive like holland a mo move which a lot of people did hes hes the same ownership in our mug league as holland right now and all everyone who owned him capped him as they should he was easily the best cap and he came through barely barely but came through he had a oneonone and the world e but well thats not like holland didnt miss any chances hell we captain palmer anyway so palm jokes on us but his friends miss chances to deny assist thats what we were up thats why got a bath though hey we take a bath hey we take a bath more points in holland get huge let me update the leagues november mug leaders according to ff game we because the games not updated yet evert van balon and eddie tied of first cam anderson and ross logan tied for second bent schen bower in third place good j by all of you theres a another short month because theres an international break soon so maybe a good mug month and then ski card leading the public league same as last week whats up where do where to begin i feel like theres a lot of talking points today i need i have some selfish talking points that i want to go over with you but mean i think the first thing is probably just talking about defense is seems important right now because its brutal a lot of us are sitting here with a lot of money in defense and it seems stupid i know josh b said seriously are trent and gab worth it and barck my entire defense has four returns in five game weeks since i wild card it feels low even most defens is struggling asses from arsenal liverpool chelsea wheres the line between my picks are bad and i should change them and my picks are in a down period and will come good and thats the big question right is like do we start using free transfers in a place where we didnt think we were gna have to and didnt never wanted to use freeze right im pretty out on trent like hes just not attacking enough to warrant the price tag honestly to me hes just not right hes playing so much traditional right back hes not overlapping hes not getting in the final third more than a couple times a game in threatening positions and hes seven and its like was looking at him with glass half full for a while and giving him the benefit of the doubt but i think we have a large enough sample size under slot to look at him as being just hes just a right back he doesnt do the same things that were used to seeing him do under klo and at seven its just an insane outlay i get that hes good on bonus because he takes corners and creates chances but its just not wor i just cant he has one assist its game of 10 he started every game its like thats just not and it feels like thats about right like maybe thats a joke listen our old pod okay so there were a couple in game weeks one two three six seven game weeks it was another two big chances that werent scored but thats that wasnt scored s a center back but its thats the noise associated with assist where its like i know but he shouldnt be on one he should probably be on like four or five well i think that would be if he was coming in with every single chance he created was having a having a return but say he had three say he had two more assists okay he has six more points that would be six more points than he has right now but i still just dont feel like he getting enough opportunities and enough reps because in years past he would have it because he would have had the ones that hes missing and then more right hes just the volume isnt there i feel like what do you are you seeing it similarly or you still him all im just hes doing like heres the guys who are around him in fbr refs xa its mat three assists mcneil three assist saka seven assist savio two assist bumo somehow zero t almost t with trent foden one and palmer five like those are like thats the cluster of the highest in the league and its like you should probably be on three even if you just look at like the xg of the chances created two and a half three and like two to three is fair a lot of guys are on seven and theyre just over overperforming right like saka and but they also sometimes get the rebound assist and the fpl assist that trents not get im just real assist but i dont know you think itll just come good well for me the main thing is whether you believe in the clean or not which i do like brightons tough arsenals tough chelseas tough those are the last three they didnt keep it clean in any they still have city and newcastle coming soon home villa southampton at everton good run after the newcastle game those are all very cleanable and if the cleans come and hes still creating big chances every game and in the easier games i think hell get a lot more space too like in villa where they dont press the backline at all then its not just an assist thats plus three points and its an assist thats plus six points because if they keep it clean and he gets an assist hes going to get max bones and so possibly for me im just pretty comfortable chilling but i think that like probably for you and probably for a lot of people listening its not its not as simple as being like do i believe in trent or not its more like do i want to take the money out of trent to turn so and so into premium and thats where the conversation becomes a lot more difficult and a lot more team specific right its like if you can turn i dont know foden to saka next week like that is that worth taking a million youre like probably probably because i think trents going to have the most points of all the defenders at the end of the season provided he doesnt get injured and also i dont think its going to be worth 7m like i dont two different conversations right like but they all fact theyre all points of points on the column whatever sheet to figure theres other people who just have trent and palmer and wood and mo and what like theyre not considering getting rid of trent right because their just team is just good and they just get points every week because they have dom and wood and dj and already have mo in place what so i do think the team context matters a lot because like my team feels weird and bad because ive been doing badly youre you probably feel bad weird and bad about your team because youve been doing badly last few weeks and its like thats the obvious place to get the money then get the money it just also feels like there are no clean sheets are hot lava and i still believe that liverpool are the best defense and it just still feels a little bit silly to be putting seven here for i dont know just looking around therere all these four five its just like youre rolling dice and i have issues elsewhere in my team and freeing two and a half million here goes a lot further than just keeping trent like thats you have to make a decision right so like i think forest is a great example their underlyings are incredible theyre just a good team nunos this is a perfect nuno team doing a perfect nuno job right they have two cleans in the last three the red card helped but do you believe that nfo are going to keep cleaning at or better than liverpool like i dont they played home palace at lester home west ham and liverpool played home chelsea at arsenal home brighton so its like i just dont know if we should be overreacting to like three hard games where they didnt keep it clean and then they have three pretty tough games in the next four so these are the things where theyre not theyve conceded four goals in the last three games which is not a lot of goals and they have no cleans in those three games so its like youre looking at these things of well we need them to still get the random clean in the game we for to be hit theice that and it hasnt happened so far and no i think you can youre were not looking at this from a pace for pace of our nfo going to be keeping li but for 2 and a half million they dont need to keep pace they need they can lag behind a little bit and youre still in okay shape or that thing and its hard its like we were just talking about assists i think like the other noisiest thing in fpl is the one dumbass mistake or one dumbass deflection your team youre holding flecken as is on a 19p pointer and then harry wilson accidentally chips him with like his back heel on a volley and youre just whatever thats thats cleans baby yep but i think that is like a big talking point right now because mainly because of teams like nfo brighton fulham are okay these teams were i think have been playing better theyve been playing better but play once a week also yep also that but like just raw nonpenalty xg against nfls second best in the league right now bypo which tracks watching them play thats what it looks like it looks like new it is like vintage nuno wolves like that year where they were great and they finished seven backto back years and jim had 25 returns every year and they scored at most two goals a game and they conceded at most one goal a game and that was just every game all year and they look like a better version of that team because they have more pace on the wings and they have higher quality of players and they hit on the counter a bit better so theyre not going to fish in the top four but they i think some they could finish seventh there are a lot of bad teams this year its like if youre wildcarding right now its hard to imagine a world where youre not at least doubling nfo defense right like youre definitely going like sells ana right like that or cells m or sh sure and you rotate the defender and you have the keber sure so were were hyperfocusing on trent just cuz hes 7m and we both have him i think and ive been thinking about getting rid of him all weekend but gardial is also just very difficult to make a to get a handle on because this isnt also a team thats just theyre cleaning at the same rate as like lester and he just seems to score a goal every other game which is what hes been doing over the past five or six out of seemingly nowhere he just pops up on the back post and just saves his ass in get pointer biggest worldy of all of them like forget about scoring from outside the box that header was insane header and youve been and weve been talking about him as being just a certifiable donger its still just hes taking point like theres not a one in the 10th place of the xg chances hes getting and he just keeps scoring and i dont know its killing me dude its killing both of us its killing us in an immense way because he so highed my final decision on my wild card rico combination of players or gard and i went with rico who has what six eight 14 15 points since i wild carded and gards probably on like let me just check right now to kill myself 7 9 10 n 30 20 29 36 its just like thats that could not have gone more badly and it feels completely unsustainable and insane cuz theyve kept one clean in these fixtur like thats the other aspect of this where its theyve kept one clean in bournemouth southampton wolves fulham nuke like their defense is terrible and rico is an awful pick hes just an awful pick totally wrong on him and its a hold him though i he start but like i expect him to start most of the games going forward he hasnt started three games and were on gw 10 kyles back he doesnt do anything they dont keep cleans but kyle was the worst player on the pitch so thats a fact for what a factor for what for rinko getting minutes getting slapped by im just its just rico is just the most unreliable minutes play on a team that doesnt keep cleans who has three games a week until february im like what am i doing here like this is going to be pain and bad and its just going to be bad so i want even though even though hes cheap its almost like munchs hostage situation with him because i feel like i have to start him every week never gets me points like and i just find other things to do where im like if i just get rid of him as fast as soon as i can and put anybody else in i think im not going to not come ahead on that like i just i feel like i need to just god were both free from right now this is a this is a dark episode well its dark the only person i dont hate is honestly he h his little hand but he posts on his own personal instagram im fine and im starting midweek fine his fine hes doing hes doing fine reliable new only reliable injury news player in the league and then that doesnt even and i have i dont know if youve see this differently but i have no hope for city defense to just become more solid is there any case for that happening the case would be would have to be some guys get fit in the international break who r thats the case no not roder but like gundo it looks like hes running a is supposedly wasnt fit aan hasnt been training kyles not training like theyre all up like theyre at brighton this week like they should lose heavily they should just lose this game i expect them to lose the game i dont know what the to do with r man this is more postmortem but i might as well let cuz i wrote it down while i was getting ready for this pod you started on postmortem youve never even written postmortem i started on my notes i did the same thing last year i just paint copy paste stuff that i see or think about all right so i start the season with nico williams right gw one team because i y believe in for we both believe in piece of the wing back want a piece of the defense theyre going to be a good defense he keep he kept me one clean and then he got dropped i dont goko or nico williams no difference there handshake the thing that i wrote down thats interesting to think about maybe for future fbl seasons maybe itll come back get repacement i didnt get i still believed in the team but i went away from forest probably because partially because of like a away liverpool away brighton in four and five sure but look now and theyre cleaning every other week and randomly scoring goals like ana and like whatever and good god i could have just gone over to any one of them felt completely fine gotten a lot of points didnt do that just something for the future yep but long story short and we havent even mentioned arsenal defense ar so where are you at on arsenal rs casting god i dont want to make up and have nate yell at me as i did mad i still am sitting here and im like if i say something i get in trouble i still think theyre in the title race and a great team and i know it sounds absolutely insane after lost straw loss they need the international break badly odard supposedly back soon maybe hell be back for tell us hell definitely tell usll tell us gabrielles half knocked they dont have a left back theyre all up in a lot of ways he also doesnt use any of the depth which is a ett a personal problem but i dont know what to do i still believe in the team long term im sitting here with gabrielle every week im sitting here being like i want kai and saka maybe soon as the fixtures turn who are just like not kais just doing a defense stick with defense cuz i want to talk about arsenal more later but long story short i think still going to come through the numbers are still great gonna come good i think theyll come good i think the way they play and asnt as bad is as it is on the eye and theyre theyre one of the worst watches in the league y i think theyll keep cleans because thats all they play for what do you think are you also holding well i have rya so its its less painful with rya but i have been diddling around with taking him out for a million i what about in fantasy champions league do you ever make keeper transfers every week i have made a goalkeeper transfer every sing are you doing well in fantasy champions league a lot better than i am in fpl i just put it that way okay im just trying to draw parallels here im no im its not its not lost on me but no im broadly with you on arsenal i agree with you just the pessimistic way they play and the players are still fit its just the overarching impact that odard out has had on the team is just cannot possibly be understated enough what they look like without him and what they look like with him and it just touches every aspect of the team so its just the sooner he gets back the better ill feel about them but in the meantime they have been taking on water like very heavily right the newcastle performance was startling to me because they were awful they were awful and they let the goal up relatively early and then newcastle stopped playing and arsenal were happy to not keep playing so the thing right thats the thing with clean sheets is its so its so fickle its like thats the thing god tier cross and one sick header and its gone and they can see nothing else the rest of the game but i think thats i dont even know if thats good for them because i dont know either they didnt try and win so bad for them in the title but maybe still good for rya and gabrielle like i dont know i dont know but theyre hard to put a finger on terrible because theyre theyre also like their underlyings defensively and thats the same thing with liverpool like the underlying defensive stats have been good throughout these games where they havent been cleaning so its so painful because both of them are on this prolonged stretch of not doing it and we all have a lot of money tied up in that and and its going poorly but the other aspect too here though we have our last international break coming up but the pile up is coming and theys just going to be playing more games than ever so we then it gets back into the ageold question we have every year of is this good for the defense because they attack less and they just s stand around a lot more or is it just bad cuz theyre all blowing and theyre tired and most of the teams in the division arent playing twice a week and all the bad teams have better players and blah so im im im still keeping half an eye on that and just thinking like how are they be usually in the pileup the better teams the gap is wider usually because theyre used to playing three games a week the other teams the bad teams are not and they and they usually control the games or the bad teams dont right so i feel like thats a little bit of an advantage but sure i see that but like i feel like im in a insane stylum where like every live stream robot team that we talk to on friday has like poro leaf davis and cardiio and im sitting here with like well i have trent and gab who are way better than all those guys so im going to do good and then they 20 points and my guys get two points every week so somehow i dont know f i dont know i dont know mentioned there but hes not contributing hes just in every team thats why im like bad and then they get points well hes just as bad as trent and hes a million and a half less so jokes on us should go to b the other aspect to the defense and all this thats bizar is like the midfield is just suddenly like such a baron wasteland where theres the four premiums and then bumo and then nothing and then sub six million picks youre leaving out foden and bruno tactically i am not wellow i dont know if that was tactically but theyre there but i dont know foden has killed mes killing you fod hes got the most point dodge of any player in the league in this stretch only exclusively blanks except for his sub on and get a random assist on a corner against wolves blank every other game and he all hes doing is creating big chances and taking good shots that are like a whisker wide he is absolutely murdering me bruno got a pen 10pointer again all the robot teams etc kill me i dont know what the pens are good but i just make that point to say like we have all this money tied up in these premium defenders and typically the make a mill and a half here gets us to the midpriced midfield bracket and theres you think people would go like e to some amazing picks five and there just isnt one so its also like almost like you have to either gut your defense to get one of the premiums you dont have right or you just have your dick in your hands and you finger cross while your dicks in your hand and say i hope this comes good or you finger your when your dicks in your hands and just hold your bad pics and keep your now were cooking now were now were feeling something cu dude because like you said its like we were talking about trent as if that enables you singlehandedly trent to canate or trent to 47 ana or some but that doesnt do that takes you from five six midfielder to booma who you already own who doesnt play who doesnt even start or diaz who doesnt start whos on the worst team in the league shoots once every three games so you need five million or six million to go up to saka no like that doesnt even get you mo its all everythings everythings so another thing i wanted to touch on was just like who are we all going to want and if i feel like this is a who are we going to want in a few weeks moment because im having a hard time looking at the landscape and thinking about okay arsenal are in a bad moment liverpool are doing the things city like villa spurs like who are we going to want in a few weeks like how can we get ahead of the curve and i dont know what the an is but i wanted to throw that at you to see if you i also dont know what the answer is im looking at fixture ticker in front of me right now listen were going to talk about ally because you own olli and its been not that fun for you but after liverpool hes home palace at chelsea home brenham home southampton wish i had him for those thats thats a name to add to the list and s menu we both already own thats good job by us boo we own good job by us brighton are about to go on an insane run they will probably take points off of city and then they have a good run have a long good run after arsenal its hard to pull picks off of brighton though thats true does seem like no ones that nailed but wels ive been shouting wbs for week weeks k he just wasnt playing defense this game he played right wing against got like two good prettyy good chances and scored one of them where are you at with ch like do you think endod is someone whos going to be important or i just think hes fantastic i think you could do a lot worse than like 12 through 22 theyre lester villa southampton spurs brenham everton fulham ipswitch palace bournemouth wolves i think we want more than just palmer and hes like hes better than brennan johnson but in a brennan johnson way no i know but im saying in a brennan johnson way he just gets like minimum one big chance every game what about isok esok big fan playing well you were you were all about him where are you with bruno seriously hes eight2 hes been putting up good leg lester ipswitch everton coming up new guys coming in who speaks portuguese from portugal i dont know if this but brunos portuguese i know that hes hes a pick as evidenced by hland taking a bad touch and bob sanchez doing something dumb ending in bruno getting a free 10pointer that guys the pick right like if he doesnt even have to do anything but someone make a dumb mistake after a bad touch and he gets 10 free points thats pretty good my whole team didnt get 10 points but he also hadnt gotten 10 free points all year before that he had 23 points in nine game weeks so hes averaging he was averaging like not even three points a game so but hes been putting up big numbers very consistently i do think that like we both have knowledge at some points during the season like wof got away with that one again like there were those striker games where he was just like hitting the post but putting up big numbers he will continue to be the best player on the team old manager new manager interim manager doesnt matter hes a steady hold thats for sure i think the question is better suited to be like how do you compare him to any of the five premiums because im including foden in the mix and its just what team its a big two mil its a big two mil difference it is so i dont know if thats a fair comparison and the only reason im comparing is because of what you said earlier right like a remove bumo from the situation i think hes 97 owned in the mug right so we all have him so youre going from someone probably pretty cheap and youre going to want to turn that into bruno maybe but if youre if youre getting like three million youre already making multiple transfers right like youre either like getting out holland or doing trend and gab down like that so thats the reason why im comparing them to a premium because its like okay well should you just find another 2m and get saka or is it worth it to like keep one of the aention guys and get bruno up im trying to speak to like macro terms and talk about every team but long story short good hold hell get pens and random points and hes fine and good right feel like its he makes up the middle class with bumo okay so lets go over to villa cuz its like whats the wild card team right now like what do you mean like if youre wild carding right now and youre just like i want the best team like do you think bruno makes that team i dont know does holland even make that team i think i still am standing on holland like i think that its gonna hes going to be fine and its going to be okay this sitters every week is good you mean its i think its okay to us like we are doing the edge thing that we wanted to do which was point case in point not captain him like at bournemouth where he blanked and we just didnt hit so like that is to me the way forward but im not willing to compromise by not having holland and i like jamming mo im like i dont think mos better like he gets worse chances every game than holland and we talk about five points to four points for the goal blah but no its just thats not the thing to me but i think its holland wood some anybody else and then you have i think palmers in there saka may its either saka or bruno like bumo seeno and then defenses pick your poison like how much i think thats the biggest question is how much do you want to spend in defense because you could skimp on defense and you can have holland palmer mo easily thats easy you easily make that team with wood and another budget forward tr larson i think thats team off top my head no i think he just has that team off the top of my head and that it all comes back to defense in a weird way mo whos well on his way to another 200 point season the usual will he slow down in the second half he usually does they dont press as much as under clop so maybe he wont but hes hes phenomenal hes just unbelievable so where do you where do you see saka in all of this like just looking cuz when im looking at my team like thats a pretty big question is if like i could easily get saka like it would make me maybe i would have to sacrifice a little bit of a from getting a midprice player to a budget play but like getting like him versus bruno for example where maybe i could have a bit a little a little bit better of a like a spreading the money a bit better but like is saka just hes going to be in every team by game week like 14 because theyre going to doing all the things again and hes just going to be it or is he someone that you can also wait and see or like how priority byy is he knowing that youre in the byow phase sir hes still pretty high for me i feel like a broken record right its like all these picks that were good three weeks ago im sitting here being like no hes still a good pick and everyone else whos soaring past me in the overall rank doesnt have any of them right im like hollands still good and saka is still good and trent and gab and whatever but what i think i think saka is still a great pick i would not buy him this week aru dont buy him in 12 either international break nfo is good that could just be a nothing weird game then it starts west ham man united fulham everton palace ips brenford brighton like i just think odard will definitely be back by then other guys who probably wont go on international because theyre all dinged up right now thatll be good for them and i think theyll just start winning game so i think palmers still better and palmer has that long good run and thats why we both have him and then i think saka is the probably next premium that you want long term sure okay what do you think i dont im im a little bit more scatter brand about him honestly than you are just because its he we look at him and talk about the avenues that he has and and its just like hes still not he just like trickles in these points that are just like he doesnt shoot that much no i know but like he doesnt shoot that much he just gets fouled 10 times a game plays out wide he doesnt come inside a lot like its still a lot of the stuff from last year which i know i probably sound like im in denial but he has three goals this year like its like not that good and i dont think he should have more like so look he finishes up the season with nine which would be like his lowest total ever and that would be assuming they dont get a few free pens they need some pens he needs seven assists but thats also is just like how many assists is he going to get on like corner kicks like i dont know break the record maybe but i dont know i just think hes so great and they build around him hes the best player on the team hes one of the best players in the country and the team the team what is it what is the thing people say rising tide whatever the fck ship that for him arsenal get better pictures get easier i think hell get better like odard will let him come inside more control in the final third will let him take more shots cu its to me it is like i dont think sun is at the races right now like i dont think he should be i know they have the i switch game but switch game their fixtures are a little bit mixed coming up i know he usually scores against city and theyre not a good team but at 10m with him playing wider than ive ever seen him play before a winger like the ca the only like its hard to even make a case for son of brenan at this point to me if they do the same thing except brennan gets big chances and sun doesnt cuz pass and sun can no im with you on that so it does i think it does narrow down to saka versus bruno honestly of like if youre going to get another expensive midfielder assuming youre not getting rid of holland to fun mo and you have palmer like that is the question isnt it so its sala on the way expensive end where you have to sacrifice something else saka in the middle there whos just great and then bruno if you dont want to sacrifice someone like if you want to keep salanki or ali or like someone else in that range and have like two upper guys for me for me it would be like i could do like if i could if i wanted to get bruno then i could get someone like eso but if i wanted to get saka i would have to get someone in the wood range m i see what you mean so thats like the difference i think saka is way better than bruno if thats the question i think the pens cancel each other out im not going to try and predict who gets more pens but arsenal are way better and are going to score way more goals i think that like like my overarching take is arsenal just had three hard fixtures liverpool just had three hard fixtures them and city are still the three best teams in the league i think theyll come good long term but it feels stinky and bad right now thats 100 for sure because the the other thing i wonder too is its like bruno plays ler ep switch and everton the next three and it gets bad after that they play arsenal nfl and city and we know how invisible he is in big games theres no more bankable blank than him in a big game so like then im almost also they have a new manager like we dont even know what the which to me with that middle they cant be worse than theyve been either yes its an unknown but is it throw him for a few and they have these good fixtures but whenever ive been doing that instead of like i wanted eso before and they had tough fixtures and all he does is score so im like whenever ive been doing that instead of just get the player that i prefer or then it just doesnt go as well for me i feel like its thats thats where my regret for the mo thing comes in because all ive been saying all season is like i just want to flip around the premiums for fixtures and so far that also hasnt worked for me mos got 10 against arsenal and 12 against chelsea its like well right so first of all getting rid of him he gets 12 and 10 but then also i didnt get him back for home brighton when i know hes the best captain thats like exactly what i said we should be doing and he gets nine id still be on a red probably but it be not 300k it be 30k so the big difference and then vill i need more im so biased with watkins its out of control but buas which way i good or bad i dont know i dont know it depends on if he got points this weekend but where like what do you like do you see villa as different this year than last year the year before like what do you whats going on with you and olli like you you i think ive seen almost every villa game which is my theyre always oness they play sunday not always sunday but a lot a lot and they deserve it they finished fourth last year and theyre a good team they just got dismantled by spurs but i think anyone who watched that game realizes that was like an even game until the very end meltdown moment there was nothing happening villa were isue for me with them its a big part of the issue but its also what i expected i feel like when the thing that i expect happens i feel more comfortable with the assets if that makes sense like i expected them to just be annoying and all mcin does is put his ass in everybodys face and he goes down for he is jordan iou hes thats all he is hes white scottish jordan iou yes with a bigger ass and he just tries all he does is back that ass up and try and draw fouls his whole thats the whole thing was time waste and draw fouls and give the ball to jacob ramsey and let him try and like beat three people on the dribble that was the entire game surprised he doesnt do it didnt work i thought rogers played well oly had a couple chances but its just theyre not an elite team so when you h they have fixtures where theyre unfavored it usually doesnt go well owning their assets and thats the problem with at liverpool this week at chelsea and 13 you dont expect them to score like more than one on the other end when they open things up and attack and let the guys run around they have been scoring pretty good goals and duran might score duran scores rogers is he going to score his big chance or not or is he going to assist the chance so i look at them and i see home again i mentioned this earlier home palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home southampton 15 i want rogers and oi in all of those i want to start them both in all of those games but you also have to look at them for at liverpool and at chelsea which is like it should balance out to put a lot of stress on these games where if they dont return youre but largely theyve been good and the good games and they and then they have nfo city newcastle its like well its easier with rogers cuz hes so cheap you just rotate him in out it doesnt matter hes returned in every single game youve expected him to return his returns are lester everton woles i switch fulham and he bl bled well okay first game games of the season he was carrying a knock and getting subbed early every game so he blanked western blanked arsenal fine blanked man united cuz no one played that game blank bournemouth blank spurs like hes good man like i dont know what to say it just you have to hold your nose when they have they have a bad fixure because its going to be ugly but he still got a couple chances he easily could have scored in that game and then like i feel like if he scored in that game we wouldnt even be talking about it we would just be like hes just great ass that he just hold he just keeps getting like hes on like life support all the time i feel like though the main thing that gets me with them is they just dont attack they dont attack and he doesnt have the free like bruno right man utd they dont attack they try and counter but they attack theyre just bad theyre bad but they send six guys forward all the ially theyll throw the guys forward but like ali doesnt have the free goals in his back lock like in the back pocket which we dont think he might well i it would just stun me if he took the ne they might but thats the other thing is they dont get pens no they dont get pens they dont attack like no ones in the box ever so how could they win a pen also just way less pens this year it feels like way less pens this year but just like im with you on the he gets a couple good chances of game and he will because hes that good of a player and i dont know if thats enough this year like looking you compare him to bruno who we keep bringing up again right he just cant keep up with them right like but even comparing him to like esok like how is he better than esok hes just not like theyre playing too many games i dont think he is i dont think he subs and changes they dont attack they play all these games theres squads he subs duran on at 60 and then when they play together its like i dont know whats going on and the they just they dont attack they just dont attack and so like you i just feel like there i every time i look at watkins im just like again it feels like hostage taking its if i had him id be feeling exactly the you got rid you ripped the bandaid off a few weeks ago part of wild card right isnt that when i got rid of him i dont know why you got rid of him but you did a good thing i think whenever i got of it was part of a wild card part of like a triple move or some but i would better than wood hes not better than wood they attack but no ones better than wood they attack similar amount of times and he doesnt even have pens and hes three million more its like probably not he might have pens like how many forwards are better than watkins its many forwards like its not two or three its probably like seven for the price of course of course to factor the price in i think thats right i think thats right and yet id be sitting here as you are sitting here agonizing over home palace home brenford home southampton and not having him in those pictures is pointer in there theres a 23p pointer quad return in there which hes done before and we do again and thats the brutal part of this game that feeling of if i do this the worst possible thing is going to happen to me which is this guy getting a haul is like fpl in a goddamn nut chell i dont know how to get around that feeling and i dont know if that feeling is just us getting hurt a couple times and thats all we remember because usually that probably doesnt happen right no it doesnt happen and then our sins get washed away and then we move on to the next shiny it could not happen 10 times in a row and then the 11th time you get rid of fod he has hatrick and im like of course he has a hattrick god damn it i just got rid of him so lets we havent we havent mentioned the we havent talked about anything well were were just talking were just talking in circles i dont know what the no were not talking in circles were talking about stuff but lets lets talk about wood because we havent mentioned hes 65 now scored again hes the best pi in the game hes the best striker in the league and the best pick in the game so their fixtures coming up home newcastle at what their fixtures are soad so home newcastle at rcast home ipswitch at city at united home villa at brenham home spurs at everton at wolves were were in 2025 its all happening not getting them it im too depressed to get this guy now whats the opposite of sun cost ive sun my depression and im not going to solve it by getting the best player in the league so what am i doing if im if i believe everything i said earlier about gabrielle and newcastle have been playing better and ricos fine im not gonna panic then why the would i get chris wood well one thing about chriswood thats an interesting one is like we might have just been sarily mis assessing and mis categorizing him from the beginning because hes been with nuno for two years and hes just been the best striker not named holland in the league since hes the best striker including holland holland fine whatever but so i we take it that we take it that we look at their opening 10 and its been a lot of bottom half teams in there they played liverpool they played chelsea other than that you might sneak an eighth or a ninth place team were looking at bottom 10 teams and scored against chelsea anyway sure scored against chelsea and look fixtures breed form blah that just means that theyre about to play tougher fixtures coming up which i just read the run out to 2025 and its certainly more difficult than the first 10 games of the season yes but like hes 65 theyre playing in a way that maximizes his strength we make fun of how old he is but hes not that old he doesnt have a ton of tread on his tires you he misses a few games every year and hes hes hes just played a handful of years so its not like this is a player thats like broke in when he was 17 and hes been playing top flight football with 3000 minutes like hes going to fall off a cliff and he doesnt he cant run anyway the pace is in his game he shifts his movements good and headers like finding the poachers goals they get good theyre good setpiece team like are the bad fixtures enough to just say we missed the points and hes its going to dry up or is this just us finding more reasons to shoot ourselves in the foot thats what it feels like its that me saying even me saying im not getting him made you laugh like why does that lets analyze that why is that funny its funny because its so stupid because hes better than holland hes better than salan hes better than everyone and we dont own him because and hes cheap but why like why wouldnt we both get him now we should we should be part of our transfers to should just be to get them we should get him in this week we should get him in every week every week that passes get him in once this week next week whenever doesnt matter i dont know what to say dude okay aral at city youre start everyones just going to start him like i dont know thats when you rotate in rogers is rogers is home palace home brenford and those two is that the five is that the five head where we should have him with the rogers rotation for these couple because rogers has the good ones that oli has that i just named right home palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home southampton and 15 and would in those same weeks say at arsenal at city at man united right thats just free right thats free real estate allegedly its just like so stupid should have him makes me want to die even thinking about that like you getting dom it worked out this week and me getting darwin that same week that we both made our forward transfers and both had more money in the bank than we deserve and we both so should have gotten wood that it was even on the pod i was banging your head with a shovel being like no its woods the best pick get wood blah fast forward to friday were both getting in d and dar when you dont even like dom and i hate him you hate dom and spurs and were like dom and just like so much regret so much pain its just the worst dude this is the worst of it i dont know what to do three freeze team sucks holland sucks foden sucks i dont know to do dude wood its its still back to just like the fixtures for me i just look at the fixture im like insane theyre not good so do i know you talking about so and so team doesnt attack right we were just talking about villa and blah who doesnt attack no goddamn team but like then but also if you look at the fixtures and you take away at arsenal at city theyre pretty good so newcastles fine its not great at home theyll score theyre not getting blanked in that game theyll score home is phenomenal atman uniteds probably fine although like nfo would this is here i am making more excuses like an absolute but im going to do it anyway my goddamn pod but like would and nfo should in theory be the type of team that doesnt like a goddamn pile up right like playing every three days for this fcking small squad like how much can a longa and cho and ana and moreno and would run in a week like lets put that to the test i dont know dude i feel like a complete idiot and im lost at se right now would so i dont know what to do i should just bow down to the robot itll tell me to just get wood and e thats probably the recommended m get an injured e get as a wood and bruno thats what itll say to me if i punch in my team right now im sure but so you going to get wood or what i dont know its the players i want to remove the most are watkins dipod and trent and i was going to bring up dibling because the theory of rotating in rogers works well if you have an eighth att if rogers your eighth attacker but for me i have archer and you have dibling so it doesnt work one of them plays and one of them doesnt but like i dont i dont want to start archer anymore than i h already have right and thats where like want to looking at the next month or two i want to move rogers to be my eighth attacker i dont want to rely on him on a week on we basis and so thats something that im putting a high emphasis and value on of getting rid of dibling because hes not he isnt isnt he is the false hope hes not what i was hoping he would become and im ready to cash in there so i can afford everything i can punch in those three spots is phenomenal but i just dont know which combination of phenoms i want luckily theyre all phenomenal though cu then that means feel it feels like i cant go wrong with the replacements combination of phen so goddamn good it feels like i cant go wrong but i know im gonna pick the wrong ones and go its gonna go wrong if i had to describe a f to someone whos never heard of the game i would say its a game you just cant go wrong you just get just get good guys and nothing bad ever happens you cant go wrong until you just want to die well thats where i am theres a lot of questions here but i just dont want to read them okay so i think well just push them to thursday maybe okay except for these two lifestyle questions we could do those before we do that so you dont have too strong vibes about anything youre just a mess im definitely a mess but i think everyone should get wood and i think saka is better than bruno those are the questions you as me right what i can ill just do that like i can just do that take a hit get them in saka is at chelsea this week im very happy if you waited a week for it maybe but but if i wait a like me waiting a week means that i start walkins at liverpool like give me saka i dont like that like its so the waiting is less advantage but the other thing i can which might just be also a thing i could do is just get bruno now inste of saka and wait on saka and brunos just placehold until i feel like making that switch im very fine with that too at chelsea is bad home nfls bad like bad every week so far this season the big teams have struggled after the international break i could be wrong someones going to comment spurs beat well theyre not a bigley 8 n whatever the i dont care but im pretty sure thats how its gone is like after the international break liverpool lost one nil to forest man city barely beat brenford arsenal barely beat spurs chelsea got dominated by bourou that was the first international break next international break let me see arsenal lost two nil to bournemouth city barely beat wolves liverpool barely beat chelsea and now were here and the next international break its probably more of the same theres no reason for me to believe it wont be they come back slow all their best players are away 8000 miles away in south america whatever wait on them f im fine with you waiting on saka bruno wood i could also just get not hit keep trent get bruno and strand larson you cant do bruno and wood no i cant afford it and then get get wood for salanki after ip switch coia by the way we talked about coa on the live stream everyones going coa everyone in discord absolutely wanking to him getting an assist in one bones me and you sitting here saying id rather have the striker guess what he got a goal and two bones not one bone i dont know but thats thats another thing thats interesting to like i like str larson just being so slept on because everyone world has k you cuz strand larson is also like lowkey a younger version of wood hes good hes been good ive all season ive been saying damn he looks great like im psy he poaches and hes good work grade and hes so i might i could do that i could do that not hit i like him a lot not hit not hit do that but what do you think about solani just long term like is this did this triple return he like hes just definitely keep him through the tough fixtures and or is it like hes still too expensive compared to the wood and the the triple return was like everything i feel like i was saying last week about spurs is like all they are is inconsistent and thats fine because every team outside of liverpool city and arsenal i expect to be inconsistent and southampton theyre very consistent too consistently but we got it we got it spurs like that game was on such a knifes edge like i implore people who just watched highlights and are like my god spurs were amazing to go back and watch that game cuz villa could have won that game 41 also like oi big chance goes in rogers had another chance that goes in like that game could have fallen apart because of the way they play they play if so and so makes the one big challenge and we like davies wins that huge tackle that immediately led to a goal like two seconds later spurs were scoring a tap in and thats just how they play and other times the center back misses the challenge or whatever and then the other in un clean in clean 2v1 3v one and thats just how they are so theyre going to have these games like the palace game especially thats the worst ive seen them play in the a year where they just all their buildup doesnt work and everythings broken up and the press isnt working theyre just terrible but theyre just going to have these games whether its villa west ham whoever where they just blow the doors down and it feels silly to me not owning at least one of their attackers like what even if its not dom its bj whatever because you want a piece of the four ones and i think the four ones will keep happening as will the losing three nils that also happen thats fair i could hold dom and bench him bench him in the city game sure could do brennan johnson is just an alltime hilarious player i cant get over this guy its hard to cuz watching that game too is hes just not playing like he just wasnt playing he doesnt ever play didnt do anything just over there i dont know what the hes do i dont know what hes doing what hes involved what hes where hes running like what his role is or what hes supposed to be doing and then he just pops up hes just like hey im here i did a goal hes like okay by im done thats whats up you i did a go he and then he vacates the premises again and he just and he had one shot and it was a tap in thats it hes ad him done hes three true outcomes hes either going to d walk strike out all right thats who he is its great but so salan its good pick and pj good pick salanki could be a could be a longer salanki could be a longer term and a little bip and bop i kept saying to people not just you is like i know his last two games or whatever it was three games in a row he had three bad games in a row but like the reason his season stats were still so good is because the two games before that were absolutely monster insane games that balances out to good pick right so like hes gna have these games where he didnt get a shot this didnt work the press didnt work whatever and then hes going to have games like this where five minutes he feels like he got a triple rout well i think the other interesting thing too just to note on him is he did just get there so he just got there and he was injured for a game one and an just cant stop wanking to how much salan does for the team with his link up play and just all his movement and blah all that stuff so you do also expect just maybe the teammates learn how to find him better cuz its its it is very interesting watching like him play is like they just never find him and its we know his movements good weve been seeing his movement be good for thousands of minutes so hes mov on bournemouth and its like theyre just hes playing with better players for the first time in his life since he was a child on liverpool and he played like 20 minutes for them so youd expect that should get better with time and that could happen too which is and he has that thing that we always used to complain about with kane where he would like kane would drop deep build and then not have the athleticism to make it in the box but he gets to the box thats how he gets that got the goals right like he comes deep he does a little wall pass whatever gets to the box and then its like either him or bj are gonna get this tap in hes not that slow so i dont know i think hes a longterm good pick but all right so we move a lot of these things to next to thursday maybe ill sit tight with them all right so what do we got for lifestyle we had a couple ones lifestyle a couple questions fed said orange juice with or without pulp asking a couple diabetics about a sugar water we cant do that but what about in your in your olden days prediabetic as much pulp as you could put in it couldnt agree more i love i dont like la juice without pulp at all never have its disgusting it tastes vile id rather drink act actual lemon juice the when you burp up throw up a little bit thats what orange juice tastes like without pulp and with pulp it tastes like heaven youre on an island with like with like so you go to the store and you get the tropicana with lots of pulp thats the only orange juice i will drink i just think about the sopranos thing where he comes out and hes like hes like the is this and ks like you like the orange juice with my god she throws it at its head so good but fresh squee fresh squeezed orange juice can have nothing i dont care whats in that it could be pul no the greatest thing of all time its one of the ne of the gods were talking about store bot were talking but i just want to clarify that doesnt cross pollinate with that fresh squeeze is a different beverage entirely fing and this is just for you said who are you sticking the armband on tomorrow fantasy champions league fuckle i dont know i havent made my moves yet i was i was looking at garasi the dort dortman lad okay i was also looking at theyre playing sturm grates the stms grads wherever they from i dont know and then i was also looking at getting vinnie in i havent had vin vinnies milans been bad but i dont know i still feel like milans maybe not like that dog so i dont know who stm grates are so maybe i would go cheeky gassi has a lot of goals maybe go with him so hes going to have the fire under his ass not winning the balon door theyre seemingly very who do you like there for the cap dude i dont know between the two gasi or well i have to im gna bring someone in the cap so if i sounds good to me gassi i like everything ive heard about him looks good all right ill probably

everyone but im having a bad time so thats not going to happen let me slap asses here new signups willie naylor dixon world piece steven kaplan david sher ass baby get in there any last words do you think you guys are going to clean villa this weekend probably because they suck and theyre stupid not because they suck and theyre stupid because theyre going to play the exact same way i think and theyre just going to time waste and try and draw fouls and just not attack much at all no game will break out yes so i think itll be a lot of that which is pretty good for a clean i think all right all right dude any last words all right bab see you tomorrow see you tomorrow check us out fieldcom fieldcom subscribe
