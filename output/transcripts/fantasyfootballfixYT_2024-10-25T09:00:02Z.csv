hello everybody and a very warm welcome back to the fantasy football fix youtube channel my name is fpl phillips and its that time of the week where its another episode of eddie versus the algorithm the series here im taking on the kabua generated team put together by the fantasy football fix algorithm for each game week of the 38 across the 2425 season so far its even stevens four game weeks a piece now after eight game weeks so i dont think its ever been this close before at this point in the season so im having a lot of fun playing this series so far this year hopefully you guys having it finding it enjoyable to watch and hopefully taking some key learning points for each game week across the eight that weve had so far and hopefully i continue to provide some more useful information or maybe some insight or just even some key players that maybe youve not even thought of in these videos so far thats what we often see from the algorithm team and sometimes because im using a free hit essentially each week i also get to have a little bit of fun with my picks all said and done lets move into having a look at the teams for game week n both the algo team my own team and then also discussing the captaincy howling sc scampton at home but can anyone else provide a better alternative to the outter form norwegian i dont know if out of form is the right word for someone who performs so well in midweek but earling holland hasnt been worth the price tag so to speak in fpl at least across the last three game weeks thats definitely for sure i think its zero big chances so far but thats all to come later on in todays video were going to kick things off is with the goalkeeper of the algorithm 11 and it team has predicted 70 points for a single game we is one of the higher predicted points totals that we do get so the keeper is going to be edison and man city just continue to do their thing this season it seems of looking like on paper great clean sheet potential 100 and then they just coned a goal and the ext expect the goals caned the data can look as good as it possibly can it can look fantastic it can look one of the best in the league but they just always seem to let one in whether its edisons fault whether its just a sloppy goal they just seem to do that and thats something the stats cant measure so personally not a massive fan on the of the man city defense in total the caveat that would be southampton at home is probably the best fixture of the season to look at for a clean sheet and when there arent too many standout options from the other big sides liverpool and arsenal facing off against each other for this game week edison does seem a pretty sensible pick all in all so i cant have a go too much at the computer for that one into defense then weve got a double up on the brenford backline which is something that if you told me two gams ago id have called you stupid because what was it 53 they had in that game against wolves theyve conceded lots of goals before as well christen aer i think rico henrys not too far away from coming back but a seems to be one that comes in quite a lot for the algorithm its the second time i think at least weve seen him in the algorithm team so far this season but ips at home looks like again an okay fixture for clean sheet potential i say nowhere near the possibilities of southampton at home ipswich have looked like a pretty decent attacking side truth be told and i think there could be goals in that game i think brenford will come away with the win but i think there will be goals in that one and so personally not the picks for me pinu definitely got some attacking potential in there as well weve seen that from time and time again from him not just in previous game weeks just gone but also in his many seasons in the premier league that hes had now it feels like so pinck i dont hate him as a pick for some attacking threat but if youre going to go there it seems like you could maybe go for a bit more of a nailed on attacking force as terms of an individual defensive pick like vardal per se whos come into his own a bit over the last two game weeks hes he scored some cracking goals in his time at man city and last game we was no different h hes just getting to those positions now where we saw on the back end the last season what he can do when he gets in and around the box and hes got confidence at the moment we have to say that southampton at home seems to fixure where hell definitely go and blank now with man city defenders that tends to be the case theyll probably one goal win for one v wont get any attacking involvement but on paper this looks a very good week for vardal and to be honest he could come away quite easily with a double digit hle so i like the pick of him it just seems it does seem a bit too good to be true if i was trusting my gut i would maybe go against vardal but the head and the statistics definitely lean in favor of him being a very good pick for this game week hopefully he doesnt get benched by pep that could be another possib posibility im putting a lot of downers on this pick but it does look good and if youre a vardal owner this week youd have to feel pretty good going into gw nine in midfield then weve got a four of bowen palmer imomo and mcneil so some very informed players in here dw mcil in particular looked very good over the last few weeks im not sure fulham at home is the best fixture by any stretch the imagination fulham have looked pretty good theyve got some defensive options missing out which could be a key point for everton in that game and theyll probably get some goals again none of them coming from cal val luin as the fact i own him im not salty at all of course that hes doing nothing and missing big chances but i think everton have had a lot of stuff created if calvin le could put goals away then theyd have even more and it would look even better from and goals numbers but mcneil has been in the full force of that as we saw moving into this more central position so far this season being very involved and when hes been in good form everton have shan and i think again this could be a game with quite a few goals in it or could come away with like a 21 but i think that everton will score in that one and mcneil i would back to be involved if everton do nowo just a very obvious pick to be honest to go for in i one of the worst defenses in the league could have visa back as well starting this weekend so looks very good there likewise with palmer newcastle have looked pretty rubbish and i quite fancy chelsea in this fixture theres been a few people with controversial opinion saying do newcastle play okay in this one i personally think that chelsea will do well here at stanford bridge and likewise with bowen against man utd i think he could get something in this game quite easily i can see west ham scoring two plus in this one against united who were playing as i record this video so maybe take a bit from what theyve when theyve played and what youve seen from united if you watch that game but the fact that they played on a thursday evening doesnt help them at all and definitely helps west ham in this fixture at the weekend and then finally up front were going to see a forward line of oe watkins chris wood the man in form who just cant seem to stop scoring until fpl harry transfers him out and then finally erling harland with the captain zan band so not too much to mention there three very inform strikers three very good picks early harand taking the captain z band and then on the bench weve got morgan rogers weve got velman and weve got mikeno so it looks very good this team im very anxious that i wont beat it to be honest but this is my side that ive put together to go up against the algorithm team sorry to go up against the alam team this is my side so ive gone with palmer and the i still have the same midfielder i still have guardal in defense and i still have watkins and harland in the forward line but the rest of the team has changed dont be deceived ive gone with pedro and ive gone with johnson i think crystal palace have looked pretty naf so far this season i almost went with kazki him and bowen have looked very good from a creative standpoint so i was a little bit between those two but i did go with johnson in the end just for the fact that i think hes missed chances and i think he could have put those away and his numbers might look even better if hed been on the end of a few things that didnt go down registering as xg so i just like johnson for this fixture but to be honest any of the spurs attacking players you could go for i like the midfield options more than salanki at the moment i think salanki hasnt looked particularly involved with what theyve been doing so kesi johnson and then son if funds arent an issue some great picks there gacho has looked very good im glad hes starting as a man utd fan now in the united 11 from what ive seen of him on thursday as well again driving forward runs into the box west ham have aaron raka whos very good in oneonone situations but you never know val mel might come in later on and gacho might do very well so i think that gacho if hes given a bit of more freedom in that game and isnt asked to hug the touch line too much then he could do some serious damage against west ham and i think united west ham will maybe be a game that does have goals in at the london stadium ive then gone with rico lewis instead of going with edison just for that thing that i think man city will probably concede i still have to back the numbers for them to get a clean sheet but ive just gone with him and then flecking and goal instead as a reversal of those defenses and then pedro again for attacking threat and then ive gone with vissa up front so my punt of the week going with him returning from injury back into the brenford 11 hopefully they smash some goals in against ipswich thats what im backing thats what im im hoping will win me this week against the algorithm so with all that said and done my 67 predicted points team hopefully it outscores let me know down below in the comments as always do you think my team will be the algorithm team for this week the picks that are different are going to make the difference but finally the captaincy is the last thing we need to discuss weve both got the captains armband on earling harland lets see the two other options that id be considering for maybe this game we go right here well make this brief because to be honest i think if you got earing harland which most people do at this point you have to captain him 101 bid to points palmer on 67 ando on 61 the fixture is just 100 there i whichwich do have worse defensive numbers 236 expected goals conceded per 90 compared to 223 but theres not a huge amount in it newcastle havent looked massively poor on average 171 but youre comparing them here to two of the worst defenses in the league the two worst in fact so i think that palmer will do well in his fixture hes not the captain the option for this game week that stands out ino likewise if you want to take a punt and you think earing harlands rubbish and you want to back him being out of form and still continuing to stink up against southampton den and buo i think its probably your guy id say even though hes got a lower predicted points tally but earling hland captaincy no doubt in my mind triple captaincy maybe not i think id probably save it for a later game week if i still had the chip at this point pleas let me know down below in the comments if any of you are brave enough to do so thats going to wrap up another episode of eddie versus the algorithm hopefully you guys are continuing to enjoy these ones if you did then please do smash a like on the video does help us out here and other than that ill wish you the best of luck with this game week may your arrows be green and ill see you goodbye
