this thing hello everyone welcome back to the f banger show my name is sila and im joined by sam gw 11 sam and once again this continued thing where you dont own haren and he just keeps not doing the points keeps working for you and now hes even blanking in champions league i know right nd would expect and what a horribly taken penalty as well the curse is working sil all because he told ata to be humble that since then right this man has been true he has scored one goal since that comment in the league anyway and it did you see the sporting game because i found it very weird like its just city again lot of chances a lot of xg but its just its just not for them right now i dont know whats going on sts wise hland is still doing the business right like insane amount of x i think the most x any player has got in the past four weeks the most shots on target and its just some black magic stuff is going on you just cant seem to score since game week five no player has more xg than and holland in the entire league so saa i feel like all this is set up just so that you can say i sold him you would think that right but no see ive held on to him and heres heres why let me let me show you why right okay so youve got you got on the screen you can see hollands run a form and i think a lot of peoples frustration is because if you look at this chart that we have on the screen is they bought him in game six and thats when the blank started for those who started with no hen right and you just know moment you sell him hell start scoring again because what we talking about here were still talking about one of the top three teams in the league yes things have looked bad but de bruy back on the bench midweek you would expect probably 30 minutes this weekend maybe more you dont we dont think of bright is a strong defense home or away i still feel like this is not a place where i want to sell and my maybe this is the wrong analogy to draw but a lot of people dont have salah for all these hard fixtures right where salah scored against chelsea scored against arsenal and the reason is because of these are hard fixtures but you and i discussed this like a few weeks ago the nice thing about premiums is theyre meant to be fixture proof a good premium is worth their price because they can haul in any fixture so hes been bad in these fixtures but hes not been so bad in sens of hes not getting chances hes you can argue to a large degree some regression sure but its also unlucky right the bournemouth game he has a chance from like six yards out same thing against southampton should have scored a hattick like i the more people sell and this is probably i dont know this is not sunken ca fallacy this is like bottom of the ocean fallacy at this point cuz as far as i can see nobody else own this guy but im so tempted to hold on to him because the more people sell him the more i want to keep and i feel like that hall is it just logically this guy cant keep blanking his stats are good at some point its going to tick i dont think this is saka fallacy like i feel like theres some validity to me just holding on i think its not sos fy because the stats back up that hes just underperforming and you would expect him to catch up with his stats right so like i always said i dont think having harand has ever been a bad fpl move it cannot be a bad its just what you do with the remaining funds im happy not owning harand because he has blank but also i have used the funds wisely do what like we said was it last episode you could have gone dcl instead of wood and it wouldnt have made a difference whether they high or not what im saying so it is depends who are you how you getting with all this extra money okay were going to keep having this conversation every week but i suspect at this point im in the minority of people who still want to keep holding but i think hes the most s player this week i think because its its just the most frustrating blank like he needs to score most weeks to make this worth it because he cost that much i would say i would say see what i think most serious fpl players are still keeping him the people selling are mostly casuals i think no man you this is the one of the maybe the positives but also one of the negatives of you not being so plugged into twitter and all this other stuff is unfortunately all the main content creators all the people who everybody follows andy and so on theyve all sold and so people follow the her right so unfortunately its not i wouldnt say it is a casual thing i think its its permeating into serious people again i dont care i hate that i hate that people are fooling my template now you are the template exactly but i dont im not concerned with ownership i generally dont care how much i dont check hollands ownership i dont care about his eo none of those things matter to me its just that i watch the games i feel like this guy is so close to scoring a brace every week that i dont think thats copium i think its just things have events have taken place where hes been unlucky and there been some bad finishing but also just mostly unlucky still getting the chances de brs back and if ive held this long how can i sell when now the guy who i would assume is the solution to all of their problems and now is the time when they fix it and im going to miss out on these halls because i just chickened out at the end okay fair enough fair enough lets see another red hour for me this week with this guy when he blanks you did well we both no we scor the same points we on this part we only do green arrows unlike the rest of your content creators we have salah we captain salah and we have all the other guys around them to get points you got to go from madison so he scor in like two how many minutes did he play eight minutes eight minute c and you still got a go gods are on my side what can i say gods on definitely on your side but speaking of madison and that price range of midfielders we had a question here from fbl hs good friend of the port is it time for bruno and nice fixtures portuguese manager coming in bruno fernandez already back on the score sheet last week thanks to robert sanchez but still we pen goals are still goals sam you texted me the second tenha got sa to say its time for bruno so i assume youve already got him in u i think that was that semi sarcastic s i would say wait i have very low confidence on all united assets right now even with a new manager coming in he may be a good pick but we dont know for sure and im willing to wait a little bit but the issue with waiting is the fixtures are good now like if youre going to go in on united your window is the next three right weve got it on the screen now mhm arsenal forest and city from gaming 14 onwards you dont want to touch those so you need to go in now for leester if swit and everton its either now or never if you ask me need to go in now you tell me united fan or is it because youre a united fan youre so burned so pessimistic this is e manager since ferguson and you pretty much exactly like what you said i just have such low confidence on united assets even with a manager weve gone through so many managers didnt make that much of a difference so i still bad to me the same problem still happen against chelsea right creating chances cant finish like you said brunos goal was somewhat lucky if that never happened would you even be discussing bruno right now same problems are still there any other united is there would you feel safer if you went slightly cheaper maybe hland up top or gacho a lot of united fans seemed very frustrated with gacho at one point i think casmiro shouts at him right because he messes up a chance against chelsea but he getting in good positions theres always two sides to a coin right so there one side thats its like hes getting into good positions at least so thats a positive to be seen the negative is that hes getting good positions but hes wasting all of the chances with back with bad final product so two sides so coin i still think gacho is our most dangerous player and if there was a united player that i would get it would be gacho but right now i just wouldnt get any hland because its i think its a forward and theres just so many possible forwards you can get right now so not too keen on hland right now youre not enticed by lester and ipswitch in particular right lets look at these three fixtures right lester have been bad all season they scraped a point against iwit last week like last kick of the game jordan a sc by then iwi should have closed the game i themselves dont defend very well and then everton lost to southampton how bad do you have to be to lose to southampton me okay i have very little faith in united saa so i could be wrong runo could score like five goals in the next three games but i dont know i think its just you should not ask a united fan this question im pessimistic on my own team i think as a nonunited fan i think bruno a very reasonable pick this week i think these three fixtures are as good as it gets as long as youve got an exit plan in gameing 14 i think you can go in i honestly would consider even highland i would consider gacho i would even consider dalo you can get an attacking defender i will consider united defender that i would consider because uniteds defense has been quietly solid despite what i think we talked about it few weeks back about how like in the top defender rankings there are a lot of united defenders its just there people get caught up with the memes and all that i think theyve been solid okay so united defense your down so if i do dalo this week youre youre cool with that because im quite keen bearing in mind and of course its risky because new manager coming in but ruben amarim likes to play with wing backs now he did say that he cant do everything he does in spotting the same way at united and you could argue united is probably not built to accommodate that system but it feels like somebody like dalo maybe im oversimplifying the same thing with bruno right but portuguese guy portuguese coach very attacking plays for the national team feels and gets forward right so dalo feels like an interesting pick and the pick that most people wont go for i agree there is a bit of i think the wing backs are question mark right now for united cuz we dont have wing backs you could play dalo could play masi whos going to be a left wing back there talks that maybe hell push rashford or gacho back will he will he play just invert doo as a left wing back like there are a lot of when it comes to wing backs so i personally am not touching any united player right now okay so in united is just too uncertain because even if the fixtures are good the change in manager and the thing is whoever is vanoy will take this game and then after its amarim for and everton and maybe that is just too uncertain switching froming back four for years and suddenly playing with a back five how will the defense handle it will there be a transition period all that stuff i too much uncertainty keep im im not going near them and maybe also you couple with the fact that we got an international break after 11 so you dont know what injuries and also couple the fact that this is a very short fix your run its just the next three so if you dont already own maybe this isnt long enough to justify a hold because the 14 15 16 are bad you want to play arsenal you dont want to play forest and you dont want to play city you would have to imagine city by both aral city away as well its like its pretty much two of the toughest fixtures you could get and for all arsenal and citys current problems you imagine by 14 15 16 theyll have fixed that so maybe again because we im sure that the temptation of bruno sure its united fans sure its fixtur sure its new manager high but also it is his price we always think about people based on prices we hold them up to their price we like guys because hes 8m it sounds nice maybe the right answer here if youre looking for a midfielder second in the sticker that we have on the screen right now bournemouth anon sano surely thats the simple pick that isnt sexy because a lot of people owned and a lot of people sold right cuz when he started blanking or he didnt return people just got rid but back in the goals last week 10p pointer man at the match performance against city like good right that goal especially so much composure they play brenford brighton wolves spurs ips west ham and if you if you ask me would you rather have a wolves attacker wolves at top of the sticker or bonemouth attacker surely youd want bournemouth that depends so like for wolves i only consider their forwards they dont have any viable midfield picks no and for bon is i consider s so it works out well you could have the both of the best of both worlds seanu in the midfield str l alun as a forward you say that but i think evan nelsons been picking up recently evan is an option too as well hes been good hes been good i brought in k last and im happy with that and with the fixture run coming up i continue to be happy i think so come back to my point right if you need a midfielder this week why isnt it to menu why isnt seano the high pick this week why are people just going i think seano i think seo will be a good pick because sano nailed 90 minutes plays every week is talisman full of the attack if they score hes likely to be involved and these are un objectively these are good fixtures brenford cant defend i feel bad for fen owners but that what happened on monday night the most objectively funny thing if you dont own fen right cuz he went what at 90 minutes he had 12 points and by 96 minutes he had four brenford just cant defend i saw that game and fulham should have scored long before that so many chances brighton we know their issues wolves cant defend you saw the palace game im already regretting i nri like i watched this game and thought like how stupid i have to be these people give up chances for fun and no i knew its always been you dont youre not getting any clean sheet he just hoping for attacking returns and by far he is maybe the most attacking defender in the league its true but palace came there came to wolves with no a no waton and they still had that many chances it shouldnt be that easy and both the goals are basic like school boy setpiece errors so that doesnt board well for ws defense but its great for bournemouth spurs we know spurs ipswitch cant defend west ham if they havent sacked ly by game 16 id be surprised but bottom line this feels like a almost a nobrainer for sanu and my guess is that hes not as hyped because people just didnt get the returns they wanted earlier or they bought after all the returns and so now theyre just not interested in going back or i more likely its a price point thing to me hes just too cheap like if he was 8m theyd pick him over bruno but because hes 5m eh let me spend more money get bruno maybe i like the piig i think and i think there is a lack of options in the midfield the non premum midfields so like saka salah palmer sun like all these guys are good they have been returning sun maybe a bit less because its been injured but the rest of them theyve been good but then you go below right earlier in the season we had diaz and all these guys but all of them has fell off diaz yes i know hes got a hatrick midweek so he should start but how long will that last right he starts this week he gets benched next week you got the spurs now medon lost his place i need to get medison out my team got johnson who scored but i think the recent weeks have shown us that sp are very unreliable you target them for the easy fixtures and they dont return and they return just too inconsistent so theres a real lack of midfielders i would say right now seo looks good im happy to go with seo i may do medicine to se but you have convinced me maybe i came i came prepared today okay b with kit and all that because i feel like its definitely a price point thing and i think a lot of reas has to do because people sold holland they have so much money now and so i cant be spending five million on a midfielder whereas i still have harand so im still bothered people dont have rogers i saw people benching rogers last week and again weve how many times have we had to say this morgan rogers is not vable he is a hes a starter agreed are there any other since were on midfielders we spent so much time on mids are there any other mids worth looking at not too many every other m so the midfielders are just uninspiring right now slim pickings right its its funny how things change salah you want to have salah i think you cra by the way i think anyone who still does not have salah right is youre youre playing f wrong cuz he has anet that in 10 game weeks has only blanked twice so blank twice has eight weeks of returns out of those eight weeks one was a six pointer one was a nine pointer and the remaining six were all double digit halls what more do you want from an what more do you i think the people who dont have salah unfortunately are the people who have kept trent and have kept holland and all that so i thought di will be able to cover salah that thing hey you mock but i would love to have diaz this week this week but you wouldnt the past few weeks no but slot put diaz up front this week hatrick and he said diaz is my starting guy going forward things can change but if lis diaz keeps starting tempting again international break after this unfortunately so hell be on another flight to barania or somewhere in columbia somewhere far away its going to get benched for southampton of course hes going to get benched for southampton why am i even discussing this okay lets lets move midfield theres not many other options bowen youre not going to hold much longer because this team will sack this coach at some point maybe thats the key thats when you go into b but you wait unlike you im not so down on spurs but im happy that i just own brandon johnson thats the level of investment im willing to put in this team because theyre so inconsistent i think its one those like if you went in already you might as well keep especially switch coming up however if you were fresh will you buy a sp player right now i dont know okay lets explore that right maybe not convinced hey lets lets lets explore that right because they play this week and i suspect a lot of people will be looking at sun and solan because were fickle people and solan just one week ago everyone was like solan is so bad but those are the solank owners right those are the ones who feel like it was going bad again people who didnt own i didnt own you didnt own we didnt care it wasnt something i wasnt worrying about it but two goals in the last 50 minutes and if switch is it tempting to go are you allowed to take one we punts anymore in this game or because now we got five transfers you cant do that and you just got to ignore spurs at home against z switch i think i think it is a decent part you got it swit at home then city away which seems hard but city has been considering every game right like not saying theyre going to win the game but is there a chance thats first score i think so pretty decent chance and then you go back to fulam home bond m away chelsea home s anon away so not the best fix i say is mixed and its reflected here in the fixure list they right in the middle so up and down but im okay with johnson im not too sure about sando though because his minutes has been severely managed he came off at 55 55th minute last weekend so im a bit concerned there i dont know how long itll take for him to be able to get up to speed not happy taking the risk of sun at this moment right now despite a great fixture coming up my only concern is the fact that we are recording this on thursday morning they play galatasaray tonight spurs and i dont think and just going to rest or rotate that much although its just the europa league because hes still under a little bit of pressure and rich charons out injured so solan probably has to play 90 and then quick turnaround sunday fixture against switch its one of those if you own great but if you dont own id be tempted to just swerve okay fair enough midfielders are boring s lets move away from the midfielders lets talk about forwards because we did have questions here again fbl h but i think this is a question for everybody welbeck or jao pedro ja pedro flags removed back in training ive held this guy for like six weeks just randomly on my bench hes its all set up for him to come in come on as a sub and score the winner against city right but well back with his track record that hes done the past few weeks i if i had to pick one right now like fresh going in i would pick well back its insane its a bad fixture this week against city but then after that great fixtures right so and whats the price difference between them now wellex 59 whats j 55 so its not that big we have money right we all saw holland we have money now i will go el back hes the third highest scoring in the game it is crazy the fact that because wells not a template not definitely not a pick amongst the content creators so therefore hes not in and heres a step for you see hes only blank three times this season in 10 game weeks six his minutes are good right like hes playing constantly 70 plus 80 plus each week its not like if hes coming off at halftime its not as if hes coming off on 60 hes not getting injured hes not going to go away for the international break because england think theyre better than danny welbeck i it doesnt matter hes who cares if hes 32 he should he should be walking into this england squad but theyll pick watkins instead i go danny w in fact heavily considering daniel w next week this feels like too harsh of a jumping in point right now against city but next week is it you could arue city has lost blah three games in a row all that stuff im just saying it like if i were to fresh i wouldnt pick this week next week though looks good well im just saying that city just conceded a hatrick against someone who used to play for brighton who was not respected thats true thats true but he come on you cant say that hes the same player now and then right like what hes been doing the p thats been in im sure like if welbeck was watching yoker score the hatrick and thought brighton man he can do it me danny welbeck united legend ara legend preston legend all the watford legend all the other teams hes played no reason why well cant score this week i think its one of those if its its timately we are boring people so its transer we wont make this week we will wait one more week just because we are boring people in vc its not green on the fixture so therefore we wont go but city have been so poor defensively what are we waiting for consider four midweek they consider two against bmer dont keep clean sheets dont look solid no rry what are we waiting for here true thats true i con your point sa im going to bring well back this week now my problem saa is that i like my forward line i have k i have wood i have r who has playing the past two weeks since i brought him in after not after scoring like five in a row but i dont i dont want to take out any of them and i wouldnt i wouldnt take out k this week i wouldnt take r himz there have been some unlucky blanks but bottom line what still a very good fixture this week and i wouldnt get rid of definely not taking out chriswood thats for sure chriswood the best forward in the in the world right now why would you take him out so we have to rename our podcast as the chris wood lovers club we were we were chriswood lovers before other people we we loved wood you guys did we got wood before everyone else and people still dont want to get wood they feel like its the fixtures are too hard and people just being soft as far as i can see no fixture is too hard for chris im happy to keep honestly this run for forest looks a bit tricky right newcastle arsenal ips city ive not even once considered selling chris wood i think the more interesting question is do you invest in forest defense now or have you missed the chance because all other defenses dont seem to keep clean sheets anyway m thats true thats true defense such a mindfield i wouldnt say its a mindfield now its just a barren death in which no one is doing anything forest defenders as well yes they return this week but theyve had was it four clean shits this season which is isnt that good objectively its just good compared to everyone else right which is good mean is a cheap second best defense in the league what more do you want thats true although fixure standing i dont know how many cles is going to keep against arsenal city all these teams coming up forest has been surprising for us especially since you were so pessimistic on them at the start of the season i bought the hype everyone thought forest were going down i listen to too many podcasts know non fpl stuff and everyone was very negative on forest i think even forest fans were quite negative coming into the season they didnt sign anybody and if you think back to start of the season it feels like a long time ago there was a lot of dis because they didnt get ena because they bid for ena they missed out on him and everyones like were going to the season with chris wood thats it of course well ed get seven games in not a single goal hindsight 2020 right no goals no assist for nk and chris wood meanwhile best striker in the country if you needed to make a defensive transfer this week and if im being honest with myself i do because my defense is awful but i like you probably just accept it nobody gets clean sheets anyway you dont even know whos going to get a clean so why am i wasting time rearranging deck chairs on the titanic thing thats a thats a good analogy z reing deck chairs on the titanic i like that exactly its its a matter of time before they all do their clean sheets anyway so why bother but allaa very tempting hes not going to score bangers every week and his explanation for why he scored this week was hilarious he just said as naked m so i just i just thought i hit it i saw that i saw that but even all even you leave aside all alex moreno whos we liked at villa getting consistent minutes now good assist this week matt sells has been great im so tempting just to weve liked milenovic whos been unlucky not to score so far mhm if you had a defensive transfer to make it just feels again arsenal ips and new cle next it just feels logically again one of those things right you just look at the fixtures and you cant bring yourself to do this even though they probably will get a clean in one of these two agreed i think for us its probably like the only defense you i wouldnt even use the word target but could feel somewhat positively towards well you said united defense so that is your if youre going in for a defender this week right y thats would you would you spend and get onana or thats going too far no honestly i think onana is a good pick in fpl this year because united been cing so many shots hes been having a lot of saves so when we do keep clean sheets it speaks byself hes whats he top second in the goalkeeper rankings only behind met cell and then sanchez is dead so i goalkeeper rankings are weird now and pope is fourth despite all the that we give newcast has been playing bad this year so who knows whats happening speaking of newcastle right again is this this is probably a very decent week to go in right for us the way okay its a fixure they could theoretically i think isak is a its an interesting option right now im still not convinced by the defense but isak is isaking right now so goals back to back i think isak could be a tricky option to go in the next gaming 12 onwards looks good for isach and you say the defense is not where youd go but i think louis hall i had him in game week one and im annoyed cemented his place hes finally getting his just rewards and he i thought he managed saka very well last week still cheap looks nailed and these are good fixtures from gaming 12 onwards okay and thats probably why you dont go highland because isaks just a level above un if be slightly more expensive is a tasty differential i would say right now might have to sell harer next week dont like this okay very anyway okay so thats most of the people if you are buying a woles forward this week i think this is an interesting question to me anyway because i dont i dont have a woles forward yet you say so much but str lson cheaper here and there but k is central to the attacking i think hes the talisman of the team to me he always one the talisman do you want the guy who runs around a lot and passes to the guy who is going to score or do you want the guy who scores but hes also scoring k also scores its not like hes a pure assist so he scores he assist its good for bonus points because hes doing so much right lets okay lets break this out i think one of the reasons why im a little wary of kuna and i feel better about stran l and this going to sound silly because the prices arent that far apart but it is one mil wolves you have holland thats fine thats thats part of it that to be fair when you have harand and salah and palmer like i do funds always tight so that is one point ill concede that but another point is also wolves have one win in 20 games were in our were in our fpl bubble so we dont care because when none of us are wolves fans we dont care about this club they its a transactional relationship that we have with them getting them in for a few nice green fixtures get rid of them but if you listen to i listen to a few wes podcast this week and i was surprised by just how much these people hate the club they hate the owners and they hate the manager and they w him sacked yesterday and that worries me a little bit i dont think the bulls owners care about any of this theyve not invested that much in recent times anyway i feel in the club but the big issue for me is that if they do sack this guy cuz one win in 20 does sound bad you can cut it no matter how hard the fixtures have been if they sack him next week and the new guy comes in and doesnt like kias face doesnt like strand lson because hes too tall and you keep looking up to talk to him i dont know could be anything right and then youve bought these guys where and you had danny welbeck right there nailed 59 for a much better team you had chris wood slightly more expensive for a much better team also neil you had ral herz again id say a better team you had yan wia also better team all of these guys safer picks better teams managers who are not likely to get sacked next week why are we messing about with ws players i think its just the fixtures right were blinded by the fixtures maybe and i think those are valid concerns saa but how can you predict when a man will be sacked or not right all you got is what you have in front of you and i think the fact that theyre all similar price points like okay you could bring in a ws player they play against south at home hopefully some goals there and then manager get sack lets say they lose to southon like i dont know 43 like that he gets sack in the next week you can easily just move them off cu the chip you can move them to well back you can move them to whoever it is but youre not going to do that right youre going to stick it out for these next six while a new magic im speculating right sure im going into this is almost conspiracy theory like stuff sure but you could be stuck with this guy for six weeks it could be a good thing new manager they maybe play better more even more goals maybe i dont know all we have is whats in front of us we cant worry about what the what ifs i just feel it is when i step back and think about it and i wondered cuz id already done the i move last week but i step back and after the performance this week and i realized i didnt i underestimated just and this is the thing about smaller teams you just dont pay attention to them and you and i especially me i like to think of myself as someone whos got a fairly like i watch the bonemouth versus brenford games i care about these small teams in a way that i feel most people dont care i was surprised by how much the fans turned when they didnt hold on to the win against palace so angry and once you start unl digging a bit im theres a realistic chance they dont beat southampton they could sack him because theyre running out of like opportunities to fix this because the start of the season was so bad and if a new guy does come in then everythings up for grabs and i take your point theyre cheap you could transfer them out but it just it seems weird when there are so many picks at better teams who are at the same price evan nilson better team same price y better team same price i think for me in particular i have a bit of whats word nostalgia for kaa specifically which is why im not so keen on str nson because he did well for me last year in fbl before he got his injury so i feel that theres a quality player there and he will pull through so im happy going with kuna i feel honestly i feel hes hes too good for wolves no offense to wolves fans like hes a player who deserves to be in a in a better team so thats why im okay kun now if there was no kun and only strand last then i will share your worries i think so i think its a slight biasness on my side but i get your points there are a lot of options with forwards this year if you if you feel worried about the home manager situation go well back go if got a money go isa go wood go ra humanes so many options so thats thats why makes it exciting i feel like the forward line is the most exciting what is it division position in fpl this year okay fair i think thats thats wrap up because its one of those where youre just not going to know the answer for a while last question here from luke holay and this is probably ties back into coia who do you captain this week and he wants to ask you to pick between johnson and coia and i know okay if i had to pick it would be johnson i think right i think spurs a better team than wolves equally good fixtures right both of them are so wolves sof at home spurs is switch at home equally good fixtures but i would go brandon johnson if i had to pick between those two its interesting you say that because i own johnson and i havent considered captaining him at all whereas if you had to pick between johnson or k im sure you we will go j right well you have go we have go scorer odds on the screen right now from check the chance and ive seen people talk about captaining kuna not its not a mainstream thing but there are people who are talking about it just because this feels like a week where on paper at least and again you got to bear in mind most people have sold holland and a lot of people dont own solan so because a lot of people sold sank last week before the hall so people who dont have either these guys they tempted because they think salah at home against villa isnt the easiest fixture i am fine captaining salah i think its a good fixture for him villa were awful yesterday against bru tyron mings if hes going to keep picking up the ball in the box im im happy to keep salah for that but i just dont think villa are that solid in defense just consider four goals last week so salah easy cap for me i agree with that i think salah like i said earlier on blanked only twice in 10 game weeks six out of those eight returns for double digit h come on it doesnt get safer than this i would consider captaining umo who at home now i know you dont like this home away things but ando at home has been has been good hasnt blanked at home hes like last seasons gorden so i would consider it honestly at home against bonou i think its a cheeky differential whats annoying though is that i check i dont know about your mini league guys but i check our mini league sa and more people own umo in our league than salah so salah is a bigger differential of the captain than umo im pretty sure thats the norm everywhere because ambo is cheaper and so he people have had him since you i had him since game week three most people have had him since then so i think ambo is almost two time played at this point its annoying right to say i want a captain in which feel feels differential but maybe more of a mainstream move than captaining salah it wont its not i dont think hell be a popular captaincy pick but definitely a lot of people just own him so the effect wont feel it doesnt feel like sexy my ando is brenford blow hot and cold and i take it that theyve been great at home at not at home and im sure the gtech is a feared fortress for people who dont want to go to a bus stop in the middle of london those who dont know thats thats the comment when brenford first came out this is not a real team just a bus stop in london like theres a lot of disrespect but i dont think bournemouth is a great fixture i think its an fairly decent fixture but it isnt it that screams to me like a 5050 fixture and brenford are not a big enough or consistent enough team that im willing to bet on captaincy i think i go salah if you dont have salah id probably gamble on bruno im surprised bruno is not on this list because okay and after bruno i say but okay so thats us this week we kept try to keep it short we will see you next week or the me times get your green arrows guys especially if you dont have holland and have been enjoying your green arrows the past few weeks well see you next week bye
