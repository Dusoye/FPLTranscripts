hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfixcom youtube channel with me tom camel for another elite 11 team reveal weve got craig back on the channel for the first time in what seems like forever hes having a great season so im looking forward to getting his thoughts were going to be discussing what to do with earling harland all of the stats going into gw n9 and looking back to gw eight so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel im craig great to have you back on mate its been ages hows your hows your season working out my friend its going very well tom thanks for having me back on its been a while it was it was preseason when i was last gone i think it was just before game week one if i recall correctly wow okay because i seem to recall saying that i was i was looking ahead to triple captaining harland in game week two and i did it and everything was going great at that point so and its its going to wee bit downhill since but still pretty decent score i think so im happy with the season so far definitely you can see that mak swimming a right around that 140 odd k mark at this stage of the season is strong position so looking back in that case g cr because weve not had you on is there anything thats happened in the first eight game we period which has surprised you and has gone against what you were expecting how it went the crewing of transfers is new how are you finding how the seasons panning out is it a is it a crapshoot is it going as you expected how would you sum things up right lets start with the last one its not going as expected not at all i dont feel like ive got a whole lot right i think ive got two things right since start of the season which im pretty happy with apart from that everythings been a bit of a crapshoot as you call it so i started with i started with salah and harand at the start and that worked out great for the first three weeks i triple captained harland in two game so that works out well im super happy with that but since then well i havent done a lot since then because up until last week had accumulated excuse me four fre transfers wild carded in six but rolled over a few transfers and they were starting to burn a hole in my pocket so last week i spent a few not very wisely as it turns out and ive ive been struggling string to get my head around the new value of a free transfer struggling to get my head around it feels to me im not the huge stats guy but it feels to me this year that the stats are know that theyre so heavily weighted on last years performance and this years performances are quite different it seems particularly from certain individuals so its im finding im stumbling a we bit the scores fine im doing okay dont get me wrong but it doesnt feel like im completely in control a we bit like a co right now so i get it thats it well summed up and i think a lot of managers are find are feeling the same way as well not just the guys who have had on with the theark and andrew cory etc but more widely people are still say still working our way through this arent were only eight game weeks in but score wise is looking is looking super impressive craig so thats something to be holding on to i reckon we should take a look craig how your game week 8 played out you mentioned you had bunch of free transfers going into game week 8 so lets take a look at how you used them and how many points you manag to pick up okay mate so were going to do this piece by piece were going to start with a goalkeeper reveal here which i know the scores cuz preparing for this as a nice way to start isnt it mate mr saling go there the nottingham forest goalkeeper nice cheap option with an 11o hall got to be super happy with how thats working im ridiculously happy i was one of those who got i think many did stumbled on that wild card saturday morning with the is rare fit is rare not fit and and i seem to think you and i have talked about this chat before but i was wise enough to bring in edison again his name does seem to follow you around ha fantasy asset but there we gos hes like hes like the bar of soap in a prison film you exactly whats going to happen when you bend down and pick it up and yet you keep on doing it so at least i do so quite an analogy excuse me so its i took the chance to move him out this week im not at all wow beautiful not at all blown away by well nobody is by city this season particularly not defensively they always have always have had a goal against in them despite incredibly low xgc numbers and i just had enough its just such a drag owning him and and i needed some money from somewhere so sals came in for him and delivered i think more points in one week than edison so that was great its great and a shout out for the forest defense collectively right craig you and i have talked ive certainly talked to mark as well and they were appearing at posit postively as a team defensive unit at the back end of last season thats continued right into the start of the season so they look they look viable lets take a look at the rest of the defense and how theyre looking up so you got trent alexander arnold there gabrielle g premium teams there cra we can look at the bench there as well mikeno and gree respectively as they how are you feeling about that defensive contingent ongoing with some serious investment there with trent and gabrielle whats your whats your thoughts on your defensive setup so far i think trent i still feel that hes a gift and thats what i felt at the start of the season i think the price is still too low theyve got a few fixes coming up which are a bit funky so maybe hes not going to be getting a clean sheet and an assist and three bonus points but but hes had a few of those and im going to do whatever i can to keep him going forwards interesting okay i dont think there were too many premium defenders who were delivering right now or any defenders would living right now apart from forest perhaps so hes he stays for now im happy with him gabrielle were going to get the transfer plans during the chat so hes on thin ice short term at least lewis goes back to the point about edison i dont feel when im watching them all im looking at the numbers afterwards that theyre a particularly safe bet these days were clean sheet but the attraction of lewis is one hes hes dirt cheap or he was at le dirt cheap when i bought him and secondly he does have that attacking potential on his locker okay this week it was it was gradi who chipped in but another week it could quite easily be lewis so im for that price im happy to go with him over another 45 so makes sense i dont see him as a premium defender i see him as a 45 hes got that added bonus of one of these days city will smash somebody 5 nil and he might be tipping in with a few attacking points so thats for me hes just i like it and option and mikeno on the bench there returning from injury in game week eight after that missing out previously and theyve i think im beaten in four now as well so it looks like a nice route into an an improving everton defense would we go that far or do we still not trust them just yet absolutely no i dont trust them as much as others but i do trust them put this way the form they had at the start of the season was not representative of what youre gna get from going forward so whether theyre the best defense no probably not but i think at that price we probably all bought him at which was 43 well what do you want its fine hes going to deliver some weeks some weeks not here cool lets look on to the midfield then mate so were looking here at mumo foden rogers and seeno who was massively stats padding wasnt in terms of everything other than scoring or assisting or gaining any fpl points but everything else he was lighting things up lets talk around this midfield selection sacka missed out because of the the injury that kept him out of the squad all together at bournemouth how you feeling about your midfield five craig lets start with foden lets start lets start with phil okay so i brought foden in this week i got a boner for phil and i wanted to bring him in for these games last week against wolves and this week against who was it this week southampton isnt it this week thats right so that seemed too good to be true and it just didnt factor pep into the equation so i hadnt expected to see him on the bench again this week so thats okay he chipped in with an assist for the jn stones goal fine but it feels a bit of a sucker punch but at the same time i wasnt considering son unlike the cartel and what have you it wasnt an option for me it just it hadnt id looked at johnson i wasnt hot on johnson id looked at madison i was if i was gone for somebody from spurs it would have been madison but i didnt get that far in my process of thought because i much preferred the idea of fen so fen came in which makes total sense for lis diaz i think it was diaz didnt play so that was you would have thought as well craig with de bruyer continued absence as well and well come on and talk at length about harland and the seeming lack of creativity thats massively inut impacting on his output that foden would have been as close to a lock in that guardiola midfield and attack as certainly high sly understand it so ando hes had a cracking start to the season man united havent been impressive have they so you would have been confident with the game at old trafford but one of the few games where they didnt look so impressive what are your feelings about mumo ono and brenford as an attacking option but i think its been a few games now where has at least i havent only seen short highlights so its not an eye test at all but from the numbers side he hasnt been showing any leg there hasnt been a great deal of okay of either expected goals or expected assists for the last few and its got me a little bit worried as it intimated at the start im not trusting all the numbers im seeing at least in terms of the algorithms and fpl review and yours on the on the fantasy football fix site theyre based upon historic data and im seeing i just feel like theres some anomalies between the historic data and the way players are performing right now bourma is one of those top of my list of going forward he should be an absolute lock and i think most people if you havent got him you should why not but at the same time i dont know i dont have any confidence about cant quite tell you why its just a gut feeling but and its at that price point craig isnt it where there are always going to be compelling options week to week in that i dont know what wed call it mid to uper mid price bracket theres always someone of interest it seems game week to game week so its quite easy to get itchy feet isnt it with players like that it is it is but i know i just i made these three moves this week and that was easy because i had four frees but the ones you want to be moving around at least the ones i want to be m moving around ideally the big hitting guys okay i dont mind using transfers on the son well i didnt but the sons the sackers the salas the fodes and so on but i dont i dont see him b in that bracket so i dont want to use transfers on that a menu or b kind player you want to just pick them and leave them there but its only two weeks since i wild carded but ive got to okay to watch itch to be scratched all right well were going to come on a look at game week n in a moment so well talk around transfer plans then but in terms of your more budget enabling and well talk around the sacka plan as well in the game week n slide as well craig so well leave him for now but rogers ne return villa looked good impressive a away win at fulham and se menu as i say lit things up other than from returning fpl points pretty comfortable with those two budget options craig they feel like the popular duo certainly rogers im struggling to think of anybody whos better value at that price on my wild card i there was a there was a few hours there where i was looking at calo from from brenford but i feel reasonably happy with that choice of rogers and i needed i think most people doing i need needed a cheap i call him seventh or eight or fourth or fifth midfielder and he i cant see anybody better im not saying hes gonna turn into a 150 point guy this season none at all but it seems its a gift i like him i like how he plays man its its fun to watch him its fun to see an attacker dribbling and taking people on and willing to shoot and stuff its a bit of a throwback to yester year and he seems like a viable fpl option doesnt he especially at that price so i understand that one lets look at these forwards they make so were going to come on and talk at length about harland so i dont think we need to belabor that captaincy blank there but i am interested in your read on dominic salanki in a lot of peoples team spurs have got a handsome run of fixtures havent they and they thrashed a pitiful west ham which its always difficult for me to watch but he didnt impressed right and seemed to be one of the few attacking options in that game who wasnt presenting much of a case whats your read on sank i thought he played okay but just not as an fpl okay and again im seeing the highlights not the full game but from what i saw he seem to work well with the team he put others into play which is fantastic just from an fpl point of view its just like stop passing the bloody ball so and he was a little bit like that the week before he was better but theres been a few of those games right that this season where he seemed like this foil at the top of the of the formation for bringing the others in which is which is fine and maybe i should have given that more thought before i brought him in this week because im im already regretting it they have a nice game week 11 but thats still a few weeks away mh but that feels that one feels like a mistake foden when on the pitch is always going to be dangerous s lank i cant quite say the same just after one week of being another so im feeling a little bit of buyers regret there know and i should qualify that thought we played well as well its was just fpl relevant in terms of what you want to see there in terms of shot volume and metrics like that lets talk around dcl we mentioned everton improving four i think its four unbeaten now in the league and he remains there forward doesnt he but whats going on with this guy craig whats whats whats your take on him he great value in theory is it is it to stay the course with him because of his price whats your whats your take i think i think unless you have transfers to burn ive got i would doubt you got transfers to burn with g 12 coming thick and fast by which i me to say a fixture screen fix sc then im a little bit sorry to say im stuck with the useless bastard it doesnt feel like ive made the right choice there i think he felt like the right choice at the time but he hasnt posted any decent numbers or any eyecatching performances or he hasnt looked like it doesnt like seena where at least you think well one of those could maybe have gone in the video is so little from calvin lean but it feels a wee bit like im stuck with him for a while anyway but as long as i can restructure that he becomes my first sub and not a player im depending on in the first then okay fine move and me thats a good segue craig so i think with that in mind lets take a look at how your bus team is shaping up ahead of game week nine okay so you alluded to it there cra lets get straight into the bench here so youve decided here we want to talk around what your plans are with sacka injury news pending but the idea to bench calv leen and moleno for a home game against fulham stood out to me here craig because i think theyve theyve we just talked around them looking slightly more encouraging is it just the fact that the rest of your team is strong enough to warrant that or do you just say everton are not a team we should be trusting from an fpl perspective at the moment lets look at the defense lets look at the start with the defense first of all weve got trent and hes going nowhere course that for me is a its got z zero wr all over it and and even if it wasnt i would i wouldnt bench trent theres lewis home to southampton assuming he plays and then theres gabrielle who may or may not be in my team come saturday morning so it might be let not im not sure what we get into plans but who person you got two free trans right so it could well be saka certainly could be sacka at toa but i havent got money so i need a i need a i need a make weight and gabrielle could be the one will probably be the one it would be ideal if it was calv but i havent got the money to go to himis from fulham and palmer so somebody else has to make way so its going to be well who it be theres four candidates its gna be gabrielle seo solank or u and im tempted to go for g ill lose a few quid on gabrielle by selling him but i dont mind feels like an interesting time sorry so no i think ill probably go for gabrielle to probably a nri okay who i would bench this week and then put michel eno in and then i nri comes and starts delivering the points from game week 10 when their fixure round starts going fantastic i like it i like the player as well like nori and wolves theyre hard done by again werent they depending on how you look at it in the man tit game but i like him as an fpl option interesting so interesting that were talking about moving away from arsenal as a as a double move then with these they got three rough fixtures now right with over the next over the next three and off the back of a defeat against against bournemouth do we think that strategically is what youd be recommending like arsenal are a bit of a swerve for now no i wouldnt recommend it in so far as its just where im at right now and it goes hand inand with some of the other priorities ive got for the next few weeks which were going to get onto but no i still think arsenal if you look at the numbers and its all completely skewed because theyve had three red cards i still think their hands down the best defense in the league okay so theres nothing to say that they couldnt get three clean sheets or three decent results in the next few games its just much more unlikely than its likely but from game week 12 were all going to want them back two probably three moving on toward christmas so its just a temporary switching around so sacka will leave this week for palmer for the very simple reason that im quite terrified of not having pal im not going to try and give you some stats or any sophisticated well well come on to some in a minute right when well see well see his name up in light wont we yeahh and then gabrielle will come back in 12 along with saka i say gabrielle it could also be i forgotten his name the left bank italian guy me too i know who you mean the new signing i know who you mean c well remembered so an arsenal defensive becomes viable from 12 i get it so its just moving things around right now to chase some of the players whove got the big weeks coming up so thats timer could be any week thats the fear game week 10 is s and trent thats their time to shine game week 11 weve got son and drum rolls aany and then 12 well its wide open then its just arsenal and chelsea all the to christmas just city games thrown in craig did you have any thoughts on you mentioned salah there as well i thought another very impressive performance they just they just take them as red now and salad gives these performances its been for so long from an fpl perspective have you got any designs on trying to squeeze him back into the team even if it would be a part of a hit or how does no yes absolutely absolutely whats the plan then lets talk around the mo the mosala plan for you well okay you cant have them all no weve been saying this since start of the season theyve priced it absolutely fantastically this season here i think me too so im not moving trent i want saka i want palmer if i want salah then someones gonna have to give i see i think we all know who it is so okay so its just a question of and the only thing im trying to make i have got so far down to planning out on my posted notes like i normally do but ive got a rough idea in my head that who will go and come in which order and as long as ive got a route like as long as ive got a minus four back to harland if salah breaks his knee and then har scores a hatrick he like my god as long as i can just with one move or two moves with a minus four get harlem back the next week fine im happy to take that risk thats where i feel right now because city just dont im not im not seeing it when im watching them i dont see a cohesive unit i dont see its like whats that cartoon is it what do you call that in english is it find wally or wheres w where w its like its like the easiest game in the world for man city wheres harland like hes just stood there doing nothing waiting for someone to pass him the ball this is a spoiler for us which they cant seem to work out how to do but its just final thing on the transer plans ahead of game week n you got the two were expecting palmer to come in for sacka and theyre being a make quate cory in the slack channel was making the point as to gabrielle having a a bit of goal threat there is there any thought you mentioned not being enamored by salanki to do something with him to make funds and if so what would that move double move look like craig its funny you mention that because i think in all honesty its like what is it from pp fixtion thats just pride with you ive just brought salanki in and i feel like a bit of a mug if i take him out this the week after but youre probably right that in all honesty looking ahead for where i want to be then it probably saves me a transfer going forward sometime in the next five weeks if i just sell salan now if i sell salanki now i think there would only be two and again its not for a direct replacement its for how muchoney i would need to raise in the weeks ahead so its only two choices it would be gimenez or it would be kuna if shiao pedro was fit i would consider him but im pretty sure he comes in for calv lein as soon as hes fit so kuna or jimenez would be my move for solank which would give me plenty of money in the bank to play around with the other moves i have planned you got a a expectation which way youre leaning which one will be the make weake to enable palmer to come in craig if it was more likely to be gabrielle or solanky which way are you leaning at the minute well it was gabrielle one minute ago but what do you think tom i just thought when you mentioned about the thought the thought youre going to be bringing an arsenal defender back in 12 my financial analyst background to me suggests that you might want to retain someone who youve already got money in so id probably be leaning more towards salanki as the as the option particularly as i love ral gimenez and im super impressed by him as and that is a lovely little segue onto our stats round up for the last four game weeks guys so this is probably my favorite part of the show guys that weve been bringing in for the last few videos and this is just a reminder its looking at the last four game weeks stats are average per game and they need to have played at least 180 minutes over the course of the season so this is what were looking at here and there are some interesting names here arent they greg when we were talking off camera and some stunning revelations in the expected goals conceded from team metric i had to run them twice you asked my boss whether or not id gone crazy because west ham are in there so i like that doesnt feel right but whats leaping out to you here mate youve talked around palmer already the stats seem to be backing that up right hes hes looking like a tremendous fpl asset even with the good pricing that you mentioned as well the for the goals and assists theres no surprises in the goals that well a little bit with solanki given the given the narrative had last four only been paying attention for the last two so thats thats perhaps where it coms on him andz being up and forth him and as appears in different places here he seems hes certainly the purple patch he is so it seems to be the right time to hit on him the other one the other one which jumped out is kudos and okay hes suspended now silly boy but i think most of us would have been looking at west ham assets in a few week time and not right now but every every time i see west ham mention everyones always saying bows the only asset not decrying bo as an fp asset quite the opposite got a huge long pedigree but k his numbers man theyre interesting theyre going to go south in a rush now but hes not going to be on the pitch but but its worth remembering for when he comes back from suspension it is mate and when the pictures pick up hes interested me with these numbers here and he should be right he was he was predicted to do well this season as well i think it was either 15 or 16 goal involvements last season as well hes a terrific player i love watching him play and he does it does translate to fpl points and weve weve seen that over a period now but as you say hes gone and got himself sent off that rules him out of the game against man united in gw nine and out of peoples thinking for this period but a nice shout ahead of fixture change down the line as well for sure someone whos conspicuous by their absence here craig is harland right expected goals we mentioned i mentioned last video with andrew that he was not there but he was appearing in the shots and shots in the box volume so we were bit more relaxed about things it disappeared from there and i took the time to look and he has over the last four game weeks and well come on to look at him in a minute but over the last four his expected goals per 90 is that is the equivalent of leandro martinez of man united center half fame so that tells you where hes at right so were going to get onto harland in detail in a minute but just outside of that there anybody else thats on this screen here thats youre thinking they present an interesting case sacka still super high if he was if he was deemed fit for example would you say theres a case to keep him ahead of your palmer move or is palmer still just i think i think the fixtures theyve got are just too ry too tight to not take a chance on sos son or palmer in those three weeks and so i havent made that much money on him i dont think i was just checking yesterday doesnt like gabrielle got quite a bit tied up but for me thats straight i think that the seeding is so high on the other players at a period where his seeding is going to be relatively lower than what it is then i feel intensely relaxed about moving him out going forwards understood mate so thats not an issue for me there at all youve got me cooking now on this solanky thing i cant get out of my head thats interesting i wasnt expecting to see him in the expected goals there as well so maybe my enthusiasm to ditch him has being offset by that a little bit so its a fair point mud the water has lets just to talk real quickly on the expected goals conceded some funny n team names in there right spurs bourn north west ham villa and fulham respectively impressing over the last four from that particular metric teams there in terms of budget friendly options do you think they represent a route into freeing up those precious funds craig any team that you think they fpl options id be interested in two of them but funnily enough not the first three okay so villa and fulham have been a little bit on my radar in terms of this money finding exercise im going through in the weeks ahead v i still think con he didnt play this weekend which is a bit cheeky because i think emory gave the indication that he would play but whatever i think coner i had him from the start of the season i still think hes the standout choice from their defense m fulham i had robinson from the start and i seem to think he picked up one return in the second week his numbers are but his numbers his attacking numbers are poor i know his heat map looks like a thing of thing of beauty but his his end product is poor so i think i know corys got the hot room is yin anderson fulham whos unless hes gone up in price he was 43 earlier in the week so that seems if if robinson is all fart and no poop then i think he may as well just save the money and go for anderson like who can also be a set piece to so those two are the ones i would go for from those two west ham fixtures nah im not going there for now but more than happy to look at them 13 14 onwards spurs i was found that peculiar to find them there as well pedro is the name that leaps out from when weve talked historically about them but pay a bit more for him what you read on tottenham as fpl defensive options im absolutely gob smacked to see them at the top of this list absolutely blown away parro i dont find to be anywhere near as interesting an option as he was last season even though i didnt own him that much last season hes offset pieces hes getting forward but not in the same way as he was last season and they look more fragile to my know more fragile but they still look fragile they still like theyve got a crazy capitulation in them i didnt see the game but i listened to the brion game that famous second i had that on i was back in the uk for the first time in a while so i had that in five live on a long drive down from scotland and and that was quite that was quite entertaining listening to it being described in audio bad i think theyve its always my gut feeling and its not fair its not statistically based its emotionally based but i always feel theyve got that stupid banana peel slip up in them so im im looking at that 102 and shaking my head and im im not tempted to go there and if i was it wouldnt be it wouldnt be p would be probably one of the two center backs van some like that romero so but im not its going back to my plans if i dont michel leno they still have and okay theyre not on that table im curious if theyre six but theyre not on the table but their fixtures are solid going forward and they rotate well with with wolves interesting so if i brought in i nri i can forget all about gaves injured or not and im im pretty much covered in defense so if i start with my trent le and lewis ive got some cover there and lewis again its not to say hell stay forever but im not concerned about it but it doesnt feel like im going to go near a spur defender anytime soon i understand that i understand that but as with you i looked at these numbers its like that completely defies my expectations from looking at highlights reading the reports and estimate i thought id filtered the in the wrong direction when i was sorting it out thats what i thought the first rdit thats exactly what i was going back to one thing we mentioned before by the way im just poting the name i shouldnt do that havit you going back to the who would i sold havit this week to get sal and that was on pain of death i didnt feel comfortable selling okay he didnt return but i think hes hes the magic ingredient at arsenal because okay therell be a few who dont sell in right now but come game week 12 everybody who plays fpl properly is going to have sack its completely irrelevant having sacka everyones going to have him gabrielle celba riya some one of those three people were having defense its the third player its the third ar the one whos the differential whos the one who can help you out a wee bit and when i had him since the wild card then i was amazed how lowly owned he was compared to how good is numbers were and him i would like to find a way to get back and thats also why i keep referring to i want to keep some money try and get some lower priced options to leave me money in game week 12 to bring him in for the plan was forani makes sense lets see how that goes but but no habits appeals i dont think hes ever going to perform i think hes always going to slightly underperform his numbers but still when his numbers are that high what and hes that regular a starter then im fine with that last week or the last time we had a video that andrew was on hed done this amazing analysis on kai on kai havitz and looking before and after the erard injury and it was interesting to me like he pulled that im glad you saw that as well because it wasnt information ive been privy to before and it was like this guys just a great fpl asset with or without erard doesnt seem to make an option make a difference rather so ahead of those fixtures that you mentioned craig its worth bearing that in mind guys to plan to look to accommodate him in your front three speaking of front three lets make move on we finally got around to the earling harland section of the video so lets take a look at how earling harlands numbers have fallen off a cliff okay so im expecting that pretty much everyone watching this video probably everyone watching this video owns earling harland and everyone is pissed off with what they are seeing from this geiza game weeks one through five couldnt have been more happy right and then game weeks six through eight look at those numbers drop off and look at our at average acing excuse me average attacking radar per 90 minutes on the right hand side its dreadful isnt it craig its rodri is out kdb is out fodens not being picked this gee is useless isnt he whats the crack here dare we sell him ahead of a home game against southampton done im not selling him this week but it isnt to say well lets see my plan is to sell them in nine i dont see a home game against southampton as a particularly useful barometer of how well city youre playing this is the one i have spent a bit of time watching more than the others and im just not in the least bit impressed right now its not to say it could all click one day and he could score four goals again and of course he could definitely and there we go its always the risk but the problem is that these numbers as damning as they are that i dont find them particularly damning of harland i find them damning of the way the city youre playing because the whole team has built around that give him the chances and you put them away but theyre just not being in any way shape or form creative or managing to break down or get the ball through to him in any interesting positions its not that hes shanking the all into rosed its hes just not getting the chances that he was before and please dont ask me to put my finger one the hous and the wires it doesnt matter right to football brain but its just to my eye its just not even close to working right now some im not saying somethings completely wrong in the man utd way of something being rot to the core but its somethings its not a question of not clicking its just not at all working right now and i cant quite maybe kdb comes back this week and maybe that changes it all together but possibly just i find other things just biz like you were saying yourself that foden didnt come back into a team which is struggling for creativity i cant quite get my head around it and hes too expensive to drag so hes got one week against southampton and then and then as a plan goes hes toast and i spread the money around scenario as long as i have that minus for lets do some scenario planning then craig lets say he does impress lets say its a its a kevin de bruyne back into the team and its a brace minimum right for harland you retain him at that point ahead after game week nine or is he is he going to be your mechanism to get to mosalah irrespective of how this free hit against southampton at home goes in game week nine its a fair question difficult it is id be more interested in seeing how did they play but again i dont know how martins goingon to line them up southampton against city im not expecting a great deal but if city were to impress how much weight could you put upon it is my point its more the fact the last three games they stank from a creative point of view and working the ball through to him so i feel reasonably comfortable going there not least of which because the fixtures are just better so 10 i would have salah as my captain he would be the standout captain that week 11 i would have son that would be my standout captain that week 12 it will be sal palmer its a while until alland becomes that two expected points per game stand out more than the other players so i think i can i feel like i feel like i can i can take the chance and spread that money its a fair point it could easily be im drenched and sweat on the saturday morning of game week 10 my finger wavering over the mouse key not quite sure whether to do it but right now it feels like its its
