good afternoon everybody welcome to the first of two qas in this international break its you get the football and you enjoy it for a couple of weeks and then its ripped from under your feet isnt it sam yeah and then you think oh what shall i do with myself i know what ill do ill come and listen to asam sam talk about fpl yeah well theres good amount good number of people in the in the chat already im already seeing some questions about wild cards and players i know theres a lot of panic around players on international duty as well especially matoma whos with japan who gets back late and now pedros been called up obviously so yeah for brazil so well be talking about him so yeah get your questions in the chat and we will try and answer as many as we can they can be fpl related they can be life related we can give you some advice on any issues that you might be medical not medical maybe not medical maybe not medical no well draw the line at medical anything else though will be here for you so yeah let us know and before we do that i want to give a shout out to fantasy efl thats fantasy aflcom and this is a really cool new way of playing fantasy football basically across all of the leagues that arent the premier league in england you pick seven players and two teams to win its a free hit each week you can pick a phillips weve got on the screen as phillips see him in the middle not sure who he plays for but he plays in red and yeah the idea is you pick this team and its because theres so many players to choose from its really exciting because you you pick a player in league one and youre against teams in the championship but we know how crazy the thef is theres a fantasy football scout league1 for the person who comes first the code the links are in the description but the code is x y nh h57 pm sam youre playing this right i am playing this yeah its its actually really different and its really interesting because i play a lot of fantasy games as you are well aware yeah i really its a bit weird isnt it but yeah actually the efl game is really different and its really interesting because as you say you just pick the seven players but you also have to pick two teams and the teams are so youre basically betting on teams to win so if they win they return you points if they win away from home they return you extra points if they win by more than two goals they get extra points and this weeks really interesting because obviously its international break for us in fpl so there is no fpl this is the only the only fantasy game you can play this weekend yeah but this weekend you can still play this we have 13 games still on across leagues one and two three games in league one 10 games in league two so you can pick your players and its important that you do go actually pick your players so your players do roll over but its effectively having a free hit you can make as many changes as you every week so yeah go and have a little look at it and it is a really interesting game free to play and you say its 100 pound for the winner of our league so it wouldnt be that difficult to catch up either because the points are its quite easy to score points in this league if you get them right and a bit on challenge and some of the other games you can change players right up until the moment they kick a ball which is obviously interesting because then if they dont start or you fancy a change suddenly at the last minute because you see the team sheet for i dont know barnes and the game against bristol then you can go and swap out the players its really good i love fantasy football because it makes games i know burnley versus stoke more exciting now its going to be bristol city versus portsmouth im watching it is exactly that because to be honest i bel apart from the championship and i will
