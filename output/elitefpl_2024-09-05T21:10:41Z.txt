a impromptu i guess live stream discussing all things wild card theres a specific reason why myself and rare doing this because anybody that is a patreon member will be aware of an hour and a half discussion me and ry had basically talking about m wild card and i said to ry afterwards im why arent we doing this on a live stream we should have done this as a live stream because i think it would be more beneficial to the channel from a from a self point of view so good morning ry good morning steo how are you im im im all good ive got an hour before work so we got a quick say rush through it were g to have an hour of discussion about all this because me and you have been chatting since that patreon podcast regarding the factors of having salah having no salah having hen having no hen or having both essentially is this now in my specific team which you saw the other day within reason we were both in agreement that were happy with the picks that ive gone with this just the odd one here or there you werent particularly happy with the wild card that i want to do ill be showing people in a minute but im going to put up on screen now my team which is their the wild card team right now and basically weve got the braning go lewis dea trent rogers diaz salah seeno htz pedro and holland and then on the sub bench we have got fleen because its going to be that rotation pairing of fleen and foran and robinson and greaves of ipswitch so my concerns with this specific team i say concerns players that im really not particularly interested in specific al for the next three game weeks and i must make this clear this is for the ne this is this wild card is essentially before i get hen back is for the next three game weeks so game weeks four five and six i dont want this team i want the majority of it im not going to lie the majority of this team is going to be staying as it is the team that i want for myself personally is going to be the one that im putting up on screen now ray which is going to be no hland whatsoever its going to have zero hland but what it will have is palmer watkins and robertson instead so im going to put that up on screen now there we are all is glory i wonder if thats going to become even better for the audience yep there it is so essentially instead of hland someone else who ive completely forgotten about oh diaz and dena ive got robertson palmer and watkins for the next three game weeks those specific fixtures for anybody listening on audio in fact ry you could probably tell me because i havent even got the fbl site up on my screen would you believe but certainly i do know that the fixtures for aston villa are very good i know that the going against palmer is something which i think im going to potentially regret because i think palmer is fixture proof and double liverpool defense i think for these fixtures that theyve got up coming knock forest bournemouth walls crystal palace in my opinion are just i think theyre theyre gold dust and with man citys fixtures of brenford arsenal newcastle for these next three i dont i per i personally think from a team stand point ill do better with this team with watkins palmer and robertson over what youre going to be suggesting which is hen in this team and then it obviously that comes at a detriment to x y and zed players so do you want to just talk us through your thought processes regarding having firstly having hen in the team yeah i think a lot covers the week against the game against brenford where hell be the most captain player and i fully expect him to at least get one return so i can see your thinking in regards to not having him but i just feel harlands e eo will be so unreal probably 160 170 that any return that he does get its probably going to plummet you quite a bit and at the moment the ranks are pretty close and i dont feel its worth not having him at all actually for your shortterm gain because what could happen not necessarily with you is that i think a lot of people hit the ward button because they didnt have holland so youre taking him out now to put him back in meaning that youre coining in transfers and if you have an injury here or there might be a little bit of a delay to bring in or you might have to take some hits so personally i think you could still and im sure well go through it because i sent you a couple of drafts but i think having harland in you can still create an excellent squad going forward where you have him and salah but i know youre specifically thinking harand so to be honest with you steo i think i said to you is that even though hes not the best captain for the next three game weeks if you if you just build it all as three game games but i still expect him to get a minimum of two goals and if he gets a minimum of two goals then people are obviously going to captain him against brenford and i wouldnt be surprised if they captain him against newcastle even though i did say to you the other day i think newcastle are more defensive again is im unsure its worth the risk and thats the word really i think its risky to not have him so yeah thats my assessment what are your thoughts thing is i look at the overall picture to be honest with you regarding the probability of returns from haland diaz the likes of dea versus the very high potential of watkins palmer and robertson so with liverpool for instance i the way they are playing at the moment they dont look theyre going to concede a goal forever not literally but what but it probably be ironic now that theyre going to concede to a team in nottingham forest who never can never create a goal scoring opportunity whatsoever but the two liverpool fixtures upcoming at home with not forest and bourma bearing in mind these are coming in after international fixtures and reading a couple of x accounts which i respect a lot in andy mine and this guy called fpl olympian they make some excellent points regarding going no hen certainly for the next three game weeks mainly because of the opposition but there are other circumstances surrounding some of the international players which are a bit concerning that regarding whether they start or not so diaz is a prime example of somebody who with the champions league upcoming in as well theres a possibility that he may not start the game against notting forest we know hens going to be starting every single game i know hes not a rotation risk whatsoever but the upside to not owning haland in these three fixtures is that with the likes of olle watkins who yeah as i can see i know theres people in the chat saying here about this watkins are wait and see but i find that but i find that the three fixtures for watkins outweighs hland so everton rules ip switch aston villa have a very good chance of winning these next three quite comfortably you then have chelsea with b withth west ham admittedly both away and then brighton at home chelsea is scoring goals for fun a fact tricker lips was making a point about the fact that chelsea are one of the highest since the turn of the year theyre theyre one of the highest scoring teams in the in the premier league and then youve got with i said with liverpool the way theyre defending at the moment and performing really well theyve got three fixtures of which are against three teams which dont score that many goals and i think that they should they should be keeping two clean sheets in the next three in my opinion whereas i said with diaz potentially being a rotation risk over the next three or four fixtures with the competition from the likes of gapo as an example just as a simple example and theres other players as well that can be coming in with man city regarding captaincy you are right howand is going to the most cap captain player against brenford im not going to sit and pretend hes not full liverpools history against nottingham forest at home is just incredible man citys history against brenford to be completely frank is their history against arsenal over the last few fixtures has been terrible newcastle its not really been that great in fact i did a tiny bit of research and just going on literally the last two fixures and i dont mean premier league i just mean all fixures in general hens record against brenford arsenal newcastle isnt that great not that great against brenford not too bad but against arsenal and newcastle in the last two fixes again not necessarily premier league but he started them both he hasnt scored hes not done well at all and even though your argument for the fact that hens ownership and effective ownership and all that is going to be skyrocketing you are completely right this is over the next three game weeks ray sure ill have salah as captain versus notting forest against bournemouth and then theres a question mark regarding who to captain game week six when it comes to whether it could be away at walls it could be potentially watkins away at ipswitch it could even be yeah palmer in a highscoring game against brighton and when gw seven comes around its simple ray i get rid of howand see you later mate hes gone and then theres a no sorry i bring back yeah i bring back howand in gw seven easy i can i can do it i can do it with no price worries whatsoever i can then potentially then get rid of palmer and then i can bring in a another possible ability of a premium asset in for argument sake even it could even be liverpool it could even be salah in bringing in sack or something by attacking the arsenal fixtures from game week seven where its sav hampton at home bournemouth away and then onto a couple of difficult fixtures in liverpool at home and then newcastle away but to be honest with you again i think arsenal man city liverpool ironically are actually all three of them are fixture proof so yeah just lets just see a couple of comments here andrew griffith saying diaz and jot wont play bournemouth i went i want to wild card dom junes saying but i dont think we have enough information how things will be in the next couple of couple of weeks well thats why you hit the wild card you just bring in a team of players that you really want and then whatever information comes out comes out but to be honest with you i cant see anything changing in the next its not even two weeks its what ray weve got less than a weve got just over a week yeah its thursday today and then weve got the internationals on saturday and tuesday and wednesday and then its just back to reality so i dont have a problem with the information we got the information weve got at the moment are the fact that arsenal are doing really well at the moment aston villa are just plugging along with what they do the only downside to ason ville is that watkins isnt particularly performing at the moment of chelsea theyre just sporadic at the moment but theyre scoring goals for fun fulham i think have disappointed me personally you then have the teams that were promoted are all doing what we expected which is basically liverpool and man city are just plooding along as expected in fact id argue that man city specifically hland is doing a hell of a lot better than anybody even expected and i would argue thats the same with salah as well man united well theyre an absolute sack of spurs i think spurs the team that people need to be wanting to be reassessing and yeah i think for me the team that ive got here with watkins palmer and robertson has got a better balance in my opinion than with the team where ive got on screen now with holland and diaz ive got the two premium defenders and even then robertson could turn into a gabrielle celba you then have which is similar pricing anyway diaz becomes a player in which is a guaranteed starter for chelsea no matter what and in a chelsea team that scores goals and then watkins hes got the fixtures ray hes hes got the fixtures yeah so i think from nonh harland perspective i think its a really good squad and i think and again with the drafts ive sent you one with a three meum and one with a tum however you want to say it is you want you want options on the squad you dont want everything on the 11 especially on a walk card and i think what youve done is youve built a really wellrounded squad to take you through the next three game weeks so theres a theres an argument on the side of not going harland from what youre saying absolutely and it does make sense so im not going to just stand on my side and say no you got to have harand i believe you must have harland but if youre not going to have it i can understand your perspective however harand scored seven goals in three matches its absolutely unbelievable and you want to put it past him getting another hattick against brenford i know what youre saying about the history absolutely but he looks really different he really does look fresh he looks at it and hes just getting better hes only 22 23 years old hes its unbelievable what hollands doing its just unbelievable so i just am concerned for you that if and when he does get that hall over the next three weeks hey it could be against arsenal who knows the way hes playing and the way man city are playing i dont believe so obviously but against newcastle it could potentially happen is that i am concerned that youre youre youre youre facing against a mountain and youre really hoping your other players that you havent captained okay youre going to captain salah but the other players you havent captained need to somehow cover those haring points and im unsure how worth it is but go ahead so you dont thinking logically b bas on the fact that what weve seen from the premium assets including sacka so sacka palmer salah in fact look at it here the theres so many of them well this is the point this is why its so ridiculous is that work so the top scoring players so far this season in fpl salah premium palmer premium sacka premi premium so three of the top four are premium based players within the game itself you then have diaz who plays for a premium team in liverpool you then have sun who plays for a premium team mea wacky whatever you may think plays for chelsea at the end of the day the only the only anomaly here is in burma however the information that weve had over the few years that weve seen brenford without tony is that ambero steps up and does really well yeah of the fixes that umos had are we surprised that hes there in the top five no not particularly and i think that certainly moving forward with i said with these fixtures because what i was going to say is do you seriously think that for argument sake with my in fact lets just bring up one of your teams that you sent me perfect so well go with the thrum as youve called it so well go with the thrum so the freemium you sent me was as follows you had salah palmer and haland so it was veran and go conza trent dan well we can im telling you now im not having dan bur im not having newcastle in my team so he can clear off salah palmer seeno rogers brilliant in fact this im not going to sit and pretend its not this team is beautiful its pretty much exactly the same team as what ive got the only differences is its just the bench and then you got pedro howand and havs when i saw this team this morning barring dan burn which made me sick in my mouth i really it because we then got robinson yeah robinson fas can be gaves im not having any lester in my team winks yeah he can continue as he is and then fabianski who looks he could be the only downside to this team of course is that were only talking and theres nothing wrong with this one goalkeeper and that goalkeeper being i think i probably would go down the route with having the brighton asset because of the simple fact that they have got the better fixtures over the next two for definite but fleen seems to be a save points magnet we dont know now the brans been told that hes first choice we dont know how hes going to perform but whatever at the end of the day hes playing for brighton hes going to do well no matter what the same as brenford i put brighton brenford in the same category teams to be honest with you i dont mean in the way they play i just mean theyre going to be there or there about in the same positions in the league bright brightons opening next few fixtures zip switch nothing for us chelsea tottenham newcastle wolves liverpool theyre not that particularly great whereas with brenford theyve got man city tottenham west ham wolves man united i switch fulham i i personally argue fleen has got the better opponents hence why i the brighton brenford rotation i think thats not quite necessity for me but i do the fact that i would have the option to have oh ive got veran at home to ipwi ive then got veran at home to the next opponents have completely forgotten a not in forest and then i can then jump on to brenford where theyve got west ham wolves man united and then after the man united game i can then go on to the bran with wolves but were were literally splitting head with that but that team there ra you want to just talk us through your reasonings behind i get the whole palmer and all the premiums but dan burn was it just you putting a 45 defender in there for the sake of it yeah he could easily be dunk and theug be flecken isnt it theres its its price point its more of a price point team maybe burn is there you said for the sake of it but i think the so on paper i absolutely adore the 11 in total i think i did a solid job fitting all the viable and attractive assets into the team the problem is that bench is really crap because youre going to have winks that youre never really going to play fast or that four basically the four million defender youre going to be relying them at some point and theyre going to be a lot of instances where its probably going to be a 442 formation simply because of the fixtures with your other players for example havs away at man city i dont the game and even se meno away to liverpool okay he could actually do something because i dont think liverpool are as defensively solid as you do but youre going to be relying too much on these budget enabling players every single week to compensate having haren palmer salah and trent so are you referring to this team yeah the one ive ive been the thum team the other team i definitely want us to go through as well is that this was more of you were telling me that palmers a player you do worry not having and im okay well let me play around and see if i can fit something in but youre relying on a player rogers whos unproven seno we still got to wait a bit longer how much will be that talisman at the sank is there not there anymore every week havit is not a consistently proven fpl asset xiao pedro what next week will look but surely as an arsenal fan you must agree that hes been performing very well for you and hes clear the per brilliantly but against spurs i expect him to play in midfield who would be the front three then i think it will be sterling sacka and trossard i think you mad r im sorry i cannot see artetta dropping havs back in midfield i know yeah then again you got no dean rice have you yeah we dont have rice and marino and i dont think hell play party and georgino willll get outrun havit is in there to be an engine honestly sterling i think theres more chance of martinelli being played through the middle alongside trad and sacka than sterling being thrown in okay personally i dont know anything but no you do no you make no you make a you make a compelling point but okay but i think havs will play in midfield thats my prediction however id still have him in the team hed be the arsenal asset i go for so because youre quite right hes been fantastic as i expected him to be actually so but again is a lot of these players are xiao pedro for brighton again i think we ive said this a lot of times apart from matoma and burn not burn matoma and dunk i think theyre the only two nailed players in the whole team at the moment steo enjoy jia pedra as we as much as we can but i wouldnt be surprised if hes randomly benched if hes benched against ipswitch or forest with this squad the draft ive given youre relying on a harry winks or your ips switch defender lets just say john well someone else this is why i love my team regarding the nonhand now admitt were talking about a team with howand but the nonhand draft im not relying on these players right im relying on for instance if and when and bermo coming off the bench if pedro doesnt play a minute against dip switch if i feel that obviously pedro was called up to brazil at some point yesterday and hes back quite late yeah so we going to get news no matter what if pedro is going to be starting and the brighton manager has come out and basically said words to the effect of pedros amazing for my team and the way we play pedro is the main man and that breeds confidence but youve just said he comes back late for brazil if for argument sake he doesnt feel hes up to it i can easily play in bermo in this in this thre but i call it a forum because youve got trent alexander arnold in there im then going oh do i play rob id probably play robinson lets just say pedro was ruled out hed be oh id play robinson ahead of pedro for instance and you say with this specific team its its too heavily relyant on your cheapy players plus in midfield you quite righty say even though in my watkins team ive still got seanu and roders i could easily if i really want to play on burma ahead of rogers but this is the game where you will thinking no steo you want to be at least playing rogers in that one fixture at home to everton at least give him that opportunity but your next team that you brought up which is only the freemium at this point hland salah and trent its a lot more balanced by far yeah by far its a lot more balanced by far and it is as follows were going withing goal again coner trent robinson theres a theme here salah matoma seena rogers nicholas jackson haland hts and then fabianski adams i who is adams its adam full oh d try right okay th and poro and five in the bank just thought i put said that and five in the bank as well now i personally hate leaving premium team defenders on the bench id be playing poro no matter what okay i dont care id be playing him over robinson im telling you that for free so i hate benching premium team defenders but this team here i was going to say j then this team here ray is you say a lot more well balanced you said youve got 0 five in the bank which for me id upgrade fabianski to fleen thats what i would do i just want to use all my money and it means really at this point your team is now absolutely perfect in fact so if thats 05 because tra race five million is that right yeah i think his incredible value at five million so five million there we then in this in this team here i would upgrade fe to not even upgrade id just drop him down to grieve so that gives us 06 ray in the bank think about that weve got the aston villa coverage in kza defense and rogers in attack trent who i love robinson brilliant player for fulham very attacking but he beber plays with poro it doesnt really matter we still got we still got robinson in the team salah matoma is the possible one where he may not even be able to start again against dip swit because of the fact hes on international duty playing with japan small possibility that the manager make come out and say sorry hes not ready for this game possibility youve then got the coverage in chelsea with nicholas jackson whos got zero well hes got competition but he looks hes going to be the main stay up top for now he has hes done nothing wrong so hes the main stay this team here i must admit ray i really do you want to go through your thoughts with this particular team and why you went with it yeah so i created multiple drafts for yourself but other people as well i was i was saying to you that i still get dms which is great so im still involved in a consultancy role havent you the word today and i just this because every week theres a balance every week there are options maybe the only weak one is gaves but everyone else could play every single week and youre quite right if matoma comes back from japan a day before and youre bit i dont know if i want to play him okay ill put in adam a tror hts away to man city bad game on paper you might think what ill bench him ill play adam atreo ill play pedro ill play robinson ill go 442 i think theres so much movement that you have in this team and i think another key point which i didnt really mention before is you got the price points in pretty much every position isnt it you got the most expensive midfielder you got the most expensive striker and i look at a jackson and i think jackson is not a season keeper jackson is a okay i hope he plays these next three or four games and assess it from there i look at him hes got bournemouth west ham brighton and forest in his next four games i would be very surprised if he doesnt start at least three of those because i said in the last stream hes the only actual target man in essence in air quotes i use that very loosely that term that chelsea have and a lot of the times in the in the three games that they played is that jackson does find himself hes got fantastic movement for frontman hes in great positions hes just not a great finisher however i still expect him to get a couple of goals over the next two three games and i also thought to myself why i think this draft is so much better than the other one i sent you is because its a lot of money to have palmer and youre not going to cap him and im just thinking look get an asset who at the moment is playing whos in form who seems to be trusted even from last season as well nico jackson started most of the games is that i just feel thats probably the question mark in this team the reason i went with matoma and not pedro is because i didnt know which chelsea i said to bring in i think what your current team lacks is you dont have a chelsea player and i feel that you need to have an attacker and the only other player i can think of apart from palmer is jackson steven now he could be look i wont be surp look mesas got 48 players i wouldnt be surprised that nico jackson has a crap game against bournemouth a game i dont think theyll win by the way he could have a crap game against bournemouth and its what against west ham ill play xiao felix yeah it can absolutely happen but with the way hes playing and his xg is i just think its its its its a worthwhile punt so yeah those are my thoughts in regards to the rest of the team quite right you can make i ani into fleen as you rightly said robinson could be dunk if you want triple brenford brighton excuse me but i think the rest of it is pretty well balanced i the porro shout because i think i said to you the other day but very briefly is even though spurs were just a pile of crap against newcastle pedro good have got assists they hit the bar his average position is ridiculous he plays as a winger steo and if you want tottenham coverage which i actually advocate having spurs coverage is against arsenal theyll create opportunities the way they play against brenford against man united then they got brighton west ham these are good fixtures for porro in my opinion from an offensive point of view that hey why not tap into it if you got the budget so yeah d saying do you have full faith in palmer doing well steo because that premium has taken a ton of your budget that could be spent improving players seenu and getting e i have a lot of faith in palmer what does he need to prove what did he do last season he scored god knows how many goals got how many assists and now hes surrounded by even better players is pretty much going to be the key component to chelsea this year definitely i think that hes for me i just want him and thats just him as a man so i really palmer i think hes absolutely brilliant but rays case regarding nico jackson just to that chelsea coverage and the fact that you wont be that i wont be captain in palmer even though i expect palmer to outs school jackson thats how i see it ray just players are going to be outscoring one another rather than worrying about the captaincy but you say in negates away from other players in your team that are better than say the likes of seeno alexander mcbrien saying trent is a nogo for me look at his performance so far youre only playing 7m for clean sheet for a premium defender way expecting to get attack and returns again based on history trent alexander arnold is an individual who will over the next few game weeks score a double digit hall its there its coming and i youve g him in your telegraph game havent you ray whos that sorry trent alexander on yeah absolutely i think i think personally alexander that a is imminent because he is picking up great positions he got his goal the other day right philly offside but obviously it was gutting and i just feel with those fixtures against forest and bournemouth i me theyre just going to be camped in the half and trents average position is going to be insane and i think its imminent hell get a return in the next two games i look i look at trent and think you need to have him in your wild draft i think you need to have him in your team and yeah quite rightfully so telegraph steo i am looking to bring in salah but it wont be at the sacrifice of trent i think trent over the next five matches forest bournemouth wolves palace chelsea i can see two three attacking returns honestly dom saying is well hes making a statement ry essential on a wild card your goalkeeper ray literally your goalkeeper for arsenal what do you think on ry i think no those fixtures are tough id rather go for defender and then bench him for the next two i know you dont that b rathera go for a premium defender b rathera go for a cba benim and then in game week six you got a real nice run of three fixtures now about arsenal quickly is you cant really ignore that despite the fact that from game week six to eight we got nice fixtures we then got liverpool newcastle chelsea away so i dont think theres a priority to bring in arsenal defensive assets but i never considered an arsenal defender in any of the drafts that i made for steo never i just thought havit is enough theres a lot of people watching right now make sure you are hitting the button and of course if you are brand new around here and youre enjoying the content myself jason and ray bring you please make sure you are subscribing to the channel so involving the chat here lets get a poll not even a poll a live a live one here right now chat this team in front of you is the one that im feeling im probably going to end up going with on wild card weve got the rotation around fleen and v rugan it will be robertson at trent along with whoevers got the better fixture out of lewis and robinson a midfield four of palmer salah and bermo and then one of seeno or rogers and then a front three of havs pedro and watkins this is for three game weeks only i should clarify this is for three game weeks only so bearing in mind that hens fixtures arent that great this is for three game weeks only so it be robertson trent lewi for argument sake and burm oa salah seeno htz pedro and watkins what do you think on this three game we team chat what do you think on this three game we team very interested to know what this is what people think about now because i i this team ray its got a lot of a lot of balance to it i find that its got the coverage for all the big hitters especially with han man citys tough fixtures i think the newcastle game is going to be really difficult for them i expect them to win i think newcastle would have turned it around by them but you are right they are a lot more defensive than what they should be so yeah it be interested to see what the the chat say dale saying i want to stay above youre only above me by a couple of points dale and youve already used triple captaincy as well so its not its not particularly great andrew g andrew griffith saying this is seven out of 10 thats thats thats thats good to hear no one else can to be bothered to rate it ray so well move on to yours see if people can be bothered to rate your one so then we move on to the team which hasnt got much balance at all regarding the subs bench but certainly has got a good team on paper so in goal conza trent dan burn but this is more of a wild card for beyond three game weeks salah palmer seena rogers hedro halan ht and then just not necessarily bench fodder but certainly players in and this is zero in the bank im assuming ray yeah this is this is i dont actually this draft i just wanted to show you it can be done but its just you yeah youre looking youre youre barrel scraping the bench is awful lets be honest its absolutely terrible yeah i say i would this is just me personally i would turn dan burn into lewis dunk sure thats what i would do i id happily have double brighton defense especially over these next couple of fixtures that face will become gaves so we save 01 in the bank that all 01 and it means then that we would have some because switches fixtures do turn well theyve turning pretty much now they got brighton southampton away ashton at home not great but then west ham away horrible but then everton at home brenford away lester at home so they got a few good fixtures theres a small possibility that we could be rotating with dunk yes in fact there we are you see when brighton are away at newcastle i could have greaves at home to everton and then when brighton are away at liverpool i could have greaves at home to leicester for instance and then you got woles at home for brighton wells which are away at brenford so theres a bit of a an okay pairing there between them two but certainly i dont want to go anywhere near newcastle whatsoever and then finally the one that were both in agreeance which is actually really nice is the 343 the more balanced squad the buan conza trent robinson salah matoma seena rogers jackson howand hts and then on the bench fabianski who can be turned into fleen please could you bring it on screen it is on screen f greaves thatll be and then porro will be that particular player as well so this is the team here which i think is a lot more well balanced but again this is more for moving forward into the season rather than my plan of having the it be what would it what would it be by game week seven it be two free transfers ray or three for me be two it be two yeah when you wild card does it roll a transfer now i dont know because it does yeah but ive got none anyway so it doesnt really matter so be two free transfers in game week seven where i say those particular individuals of watkins will turn straight back into hland thatll be done thats thats really easy and then ill have so if i do it on my screen here once it all actually loads up so if i put in place the players which i had for my 343 with palmer and watkins in so yeah i would have lets just say gets to game week seven right then lets bring back hland hell probably be 153 which is just when you think about its just crazy but itll be 153 but either way there is there hand is there and then ill have to either get rid of salah or palmer and id have 61 in the bank but there could be easy ways to downgrade another player maybe even in liverpool getting rid of robertson and then ive got at that point 121 in the bank and yeah we can we can certainly by that point play around with it may even be that salah could be the one that could go still keep yeah still keep pal we havent we havent played around with no salah either of us so maybe thats the next conversation we havent you are right but getting rid of salah in game week seven where hes fixtures even though again he is fixture proof getting rid of salah it is a case of okay its its crystal palace away chelsea at home arsenal away brighton at home nothing to be scared of there whereas arsenal ironically theyll have southampton bournemouth then liverpool and newcastle and id probably and id be probably bringing in oh but then again you said then arsenal have got chelsea and its not for as at home theyve got theyve got three really horrible fixtures in those between game weeks 9 and 11 so its certainly something to think about ray as we approach gw seven we will have a lot more supposed data by this point hopefully howand will will do absolutely nothing philip saying without howand you get salah palmer saka as a two premium defenders and two decent striker and this is this is what were weve been discussing here is thats what my team is up on screen yeah its this is what my team is here where youve got watkins for his next three fixures thats why im almost because ray do you want to tell the audience something that you that ive asked you to do but you said you wont do so i asked you to do what regarding a team yeah funny it was my idea almost in a voice note and then i retracted so i was actually thinking of not necessarily making a team via the app but using my wild card getting on an excel and basically facing steo and steo then said why dont you just make a team and put him in the game week four trophy put him in the game week four trophy league and go forward and i came back and i said look im going against my principles of what i said is that i wont play the game anymore i love this i love not advising but being a sparring partner for you on this and giving my ideas because it is still enjoyable in regards to planning for someone else i thinking i think of it almost as what i doing my job and if i if i can share is that you didnt it wasnt patronizing to me but you said youre proud of me that ive stuck by my guns and gone with my word and i and take that as a huge compliment because i know what will happen i play to win and i think thats very clear is when i play something i dont do it half ass and if i suddenly went forward and said okay its my wild card versus your wild card whats going to happen were going to go through the old season im playing the game bloody again and its its its something i dont want to do because im enjoying not being part of the game anymore and also ive ive put myself out there weve done the streams together its on my youtube channel i say i dont play the game anymore i dont i dont want to be a liar so yeah no i and i completely respect that and we got a philipe saying here why dont you downgrade essentially watkins for salanki and then upgrade seeno well then youre essentially relying on rogers who isnt proven yeah hes clearly a very good player but the reality is hes done nothing whereas watkins all right then hes done nothing officially but we know that hes a top class striker its my favorite team ive seen on the stream which is on screen at the moment thats with the watkins one ray and this is my point im more happy using this as my three game week wild card and this is why i love talking with ray and having in having him as the consultant and yeah im gutted that he doesnt want to supposedly challenge me shall we say if were going to use that terminology for the gw four trophy league but the reality is that ray doesnt want to want to compete against me but i think i think personally ray over the next three game weeks this will outscore a hen team you are going to be keeping what will happen is that youre going to whichever team you end up thinking is the best one in your opinion so for lets just say for just for argument sake we both agree that for balance this 343 with nicholas jackson in is probably the better one of all the drafts you sent me this is probably in your opinion the most well balanced with harand and salah absolutely yeah now the question for chat is does lets just say weve got the veran and fleen double up does the likes of a conza and robinson beat robertson and lewis forget the rotation stuff were not looking into rotation were just going to assume that rico lewis is nailed because ive also got the options on the bench with with lewis where i can get rid of not necessarily get rid of him per se but ive got robinson that can come in for lewis if and when necessary and greaves potentially coming in for lewis if and when necessary but we then have salah versus salah matoma versus palmer and then we then have ummo up against one of well its not even up against its it is pretty much and bermo versus rogers because im probably going to be benching rogers more ahead of and burma because ive seen say ive seen enough of bournemouth but bournemouth for me are attacking enough where that southampton game at home and leicester away i know thats not three game weeks but certainly even though youve got them in your team could be really good and with chelsea being at home to being at home to brighton and nottingham forest as well weve got palmer ahead of matoma whos got chelsea and then tottenham which again could be still profitable and then you got jackson against pedro hen and havs as they are because me and you both agree that to be fair were pretty much there or thereabouts with being happy with either team because the majority of the players that me and you have chosen are virtually the same yeah i think i think we said it in the last stream well in the patreon episode and also when we vo know as well is that its about 101 players there isnt its its its now the big shout regarding its almost a harand versus palmer but again its combinations isnt it that with that money you save youre able to bring in robertson for example so you have double liverpool defense and robertson as well is going to be taking up a lot of areas where i expect him to get a couple of returns so attacking returns there was a comment that was really it definitely hit home is that some men rogers matoma and adama tror is youre relying hes right is that youre relying on these guys to actually be able to do something to compensate having harland which is very true but i do feel that there are going to be players who do last season you get cheapes who hit out and start performing well and i fully agree with your seeno shout that hes got two goals and an assist in his three games and without salanki now i thought it was going to be cber that steps up i vividly remember saying that in the preseason streams that we did but seeno could be that guy and you dont really want to miss out and i actually really the fixtures apart from liverpool away i think chelsea at homes a great fixture attacker so and but again theres arguments both ways but i think one thing we agree with is that salah has to be in these drafts because in game week screw it even in game week four 456 he might be the best captain to go for every single game week and again i keep reiterating this point my wild card is a ceny for the next three game weeks and then its straight back onto hland for fulham and then wolves southampton bournemouth who would you take out actually what are the changes youd make i didnt so would be wat watkins would be going out for hland and then it would be a tossup between palmer and salah if i get rid of salah it means then i can upgrade anywhere up to 10m or something that right thats the thing i will have a lot of money in the bank if i get rid of salah still have palmer still have palmer in my team you could you could put him to diaz isnt it really so you still have a liverpool attacker but you wont captain him obviously yeah and we just or even j or and youve h you yeah but this is exactly the point this is why its going to be so crucial over the next few game weeks where we see where the where the lay of the land is so to speak the lay of the land could be completely different by gw seven where howand continues scoring for fun but i will maintain that their game against brenford what you seriously think brenford are going to be defensively weak against m no that their games against brenford we need to be getting out of here ray just to give you simple example so brenford when they play man city im telling you this when i looked at it the other day i was oh its not actually that high scoring so please load up the highest scoring game was last season when they beat brenford away 31 other than that weve got one nil two nil you the voice 21 brenford win one nil brenford win then the 31 then one nil brenford are no mugs theyre not going to do a southampton i which were le were a burnley theyre going to i think theyre going to do very well at containing man city and we then move on to man city when it comes to versus arsenal well ray you can already tell us immediately what were last two season results yeah nil and one nil one i dont think harand had a shot in either game again do we really think arsenal just going to roll over and have their bellies tickled no this is the last several results between arsenal and man city including cup games so yeah theres a two anomalies here where in the 15th of february 2023 and the 26th of april 2023 man city won by a aggregate score of 72 in between all that weve got man city one arsenal nil arsenal one man city one arsenal one man city nil man city nil arsenal nil and yet oh we got a captain hen now youre bonkers if you seriously think this and then newcastle once again the fixtures arent almost specifically the history isnt that bad its very its its not the same as arsenal but from what i remember looking at the history yeah well weve got a 33 then we got a 2 nil 1 nil 1 nil and then we got a high scoring 32 and then a 2 n and funny enough in the 32 in the game in the premier league at newcastle this was at newcastle guess what howen did in that game in three goals what did hen do he did nothing he did absolute in fact to be honest with you he didnt even play he didnt actually play that game would you believe you couldnt make it up could you he didnt actually play in that game but in the onenil victory where newcastle beat them i think he no in the twonil sorry in the 20 in the fa cup i dont think howen played in that game or did he im trying to think i think he did but he did nothing and the answer is he did play and he did nothing i me its the fa cup game and man citys team was full strength full strength versus newcastle so again im not expecting it to be easy fixtures and yeah ray im really tempted and i probably will do it going to go with this its just such a shame that youre not i know you wont and i respect its just such a shame that youre not willing to create that fpl team just to put into the troph trophy league to go against me that would be really fun ray ive got to get out of here ive got ive got to get to work so on that
