Pedro played only 45 minutes over the break, though he had significant travel. Wellbeck could be a good short-term alternative if wildcarding in Gameweek 6.\\n\\n• Brighton defenders are good options now, with Dunk and Webster being the most nailed-on choices. Verbruggen seems to be the first-choice goalkeeper.\\n\\n• Arsenal's plans may change slightly due to Odegaard's injury, but Saka remains a good pick. Havertz could play deeper but is still a viable option for Gameweek 6.\\n\\n• For Liverpool, Jota is slightly favored over Diaz due to less international play, but it's a close call.\\n\\n• Haaland is expected to play despite recent personal issues. He remains a strong captain choice for Gameweek 4.\", type='text')"
