This week, Cristian Romero has better odds than Gabriel or Robinson.\\n\\n• Isak is an injury doubt. If you don't have a strong bench option, consider selling him. Ollie Watkins is a standout replacement if funds allow.\\n\\n• Wildcard in Gameweek 6 isn't necessary for all teams, but could be useful to get triple Arsenal and address multiple issues.

Salah and Liverpool struggled against Nottingham Forest, while Haaland continues to score consistently for Manchester City.\\n\\n• For Gameweek 5 captaincy, they debated between Haaland vs Salah. Haaland has a tough fixture against Arsenal but is in great form. Salah has an easier fixture and potentially higher ceiling, but is coming off a poor performance.\\n\\n• They recommended holding transfers until after midweek Champions League and EFL Cup matches to avoid issues with rotation/injuries.\\n\\n• Some preseason hyped players that haven't lived up to expectations so far include Anthony Gordon, Bruno Fernandes, and Kaoru Mitoma. However, they still believe in Alexander Isak's potential despite recent blanks.\\n\\n• For managers struggling with multiple underperforming players, they suggested gradually transferring them out rather than taking big hits, or considering an early wildcard if available.\\n\\nThe overall advice was to be patient with premium assets like Salah despite recent blanks, while being ready to move on from mid-priced disappointments if better options emerge. Monitoring midweek matches before making transfers was emphasized.\", type='text')"
