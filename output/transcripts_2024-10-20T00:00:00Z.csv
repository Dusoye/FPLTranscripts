welcome back to the fantasy football fix YouTube channel my name is FPL Phillips and it's that time of the week where it's another episode of Eddie versus the algorithm the series here I'm taking on the kabua generated team put together by the fantasy football fix algorithm for each game week of the 38 across the 2425 season so far it's Even Stevens four game weeks a piece now after eight game weeks so I don't think it's ever been this close before at this point in the season so I'm actually having a lot of fun playing this series so far this year hopefully you guys having it uh finding it enjoyable to watch and hopefully taking some key learning points uh for each game week across uh the eight that we've had so far and hopefully I continue to provide some more useful information or maybe some insight or just even some key players that maybe you've not even thought of in these videos so far that's what we often see from the algorithm team and sometimes because I'm using a free hit essentially each week I also get to have a little bit of fun with my picks yeah all said and done let's move into having a look at the teams for game week n both the algo team my own team and then also discussing the captaincy obviously howling SC scampton at home but can anyone else provide a better alternative to the outter form [Music] Norwegian I don't know if out of form is really the right word for someone who performs so well in midweek but earling Holland hasn't been worth the price tag so to speak in FPL at least across the last three game weeks that's definitely for sure I think it's zero big chances so far but that's all to come later on in in today's video we're going to kick things off is with the goalkeeper of the algorithm 11 and it team has predicted 70 points for a single game we is is one of the higher predicted points totals that we do get so the keeper is going to be Edison and Manchester City just continue to do their thing this season it seems of looking like yeah on paper yeah great clean sheet potential yeah 100% And then they just ConEd a goal and the EXT expect the goals caned the data can look as good as it possibly can it can look fantastic it can look one of the best in the league but they just always seem to let one in whether it's Edison's fault whether it's just a sloppy goal they just seem to do that and that's something the stats can't measure so personally not a massive fan on the of the Man City defense in total the caveat that would be Southampton at home is probably the best fixture of the season to look at for a clean sheet and when there aren't too many standout options from the other big sides Liverpool and Arsenal obviously facing off against each other for this game week uh Edison does seem a pretty sensible pick all in all so I can't have a go too much at the computer for that one into defense then we've got a double up on the brenford backline which is something that if you told me two Gams ago I'd have called you stupid because what was it 5-3 they had in that game against wolves they've conceded lots of goals before as well Christen AER I think Rico Henry's not too far away from coming back but a seems to be one that actually comes in quite a lot for the algorithm it's the second time I think at least we've seen him in the algorithm team so far this season but IPS at home looks like again an okay fixture for clean sheet potential I say nowhere near the possibilities of of Southampton at home Ipswich have actually looked like a pretty decent attacking side truth be told and I think there could be goals in that game I think brenford Will Come Away with the win but I think there will be goals in that one and so personally not the picks for me uh pinu definitely got some attacking potential in there as well we've seen that from time and time again from him not just you know in previous game weeks just gone but also uh in his many seasons in the Premier League that he's had now it feels like so yeah pinck I don't hate him as a pick for some attacking threat but if you're going to go there it seems like you could maybe go for a bit more of a nailed on attacking Force as terms of an individual defensive pick like vardal per se who's actually come into his own a bit over the last two game weeks he's he scored some cracking goals uh in his time at Manchester City and last game we was no different H he's just getting to those positions now where we saw on the back end the last season what he can do when he gets in and around the box and he's got confidence at the moment we have to say that Southampton at home seems to fixure where he'll definitely go and blank now uh with Man City Defenders that tends to be the case they'll probably one goal win for One V won't get any attacking involvement but on paper this looks a very good week for vardal and to be honest he could come away quite easily with a double digit hle so I really like The Pick of him it just seems it does seem a bit too good to be true if I was trusting my gut I would maybe go against vardal but the head and the statistics definitely lean in favor of him being a very good pick for this game week hopefully he doesn't get benched or something by pep that could be another possib posibility I'm putting a lot of Downers on this pick but it does look good and if you're a vardal owner this week you'd have to feel pretty good going into gameweek nine uh in Midfield then we've got a four of Bowen Palmer imomo and McNeil so some very informed players in here DW mcil in particular looked very good over the last few weeks I'm not sure Fulham at home is the best fixture by any stretch the imagination Fulham have looked pretty good they've got some defensive options missing out which uh could be a key point for Everton in that game and yeah they'll probably get some goals again none of them obviously coming from Cal Val luin as the fact I own him I'm not salty at all of course that that he's doing nothing and missing big chances uh but yeah I think Everton have had a lot of stuff created if Calvin Le could put goals away then they'd have even more and it would look even better from and goals numbers but McNeil has been in the full force of that as we saw moving into this more Central position so far this season being very very involved and when he's been in good form Everton have Shan and I think again this could be a game with quite a few goals in it or could come away with like a 2-1 or something but I think that Everton will score in that one and McNeil I would back to be involved if Everton do nowo just a very very obvious pick to be honest to go for in I uh one of the worst defenses in the league could have Visa back as well starting this weekend so looks very good there likewise with Palmer Newcastle have looked pretty rubbish and I actually quite fancy Chelsea in this fixture there's been a few people with controversial opinion saying you know do do Newcastle actually play okay in this one I personally think that Chelsea will do well here at Stanford bridge and likewise with Bowen against Manchester United I think he could get something in this game quite easily I can see West Ham scoring two plus in this one against United uh who were actually playing as I record this video so maybe take a bit from what they've when they've played uh and what you've seen from United if you watch that game but the fact that they' played on a Thursday evening doesn't help them at all and definitely helps West Ham in this fixture at the weekend and then finally up front we're going to see a forward line of OE Watkins Chris Wood the man in form who just can't seem to stop scoring until FPL Harry transfers him out and then finally erling Harland with the captain Zan band so not too much to mention there three very inform Strikers three very good picks early harand obviously taking the captain Z band and then on the bench we've got Morgan Rogers we've got velman and we've got mikeno so it looks very good this team I'm very very anxious that I won't beat it to be honest but this is my side that I've put together to go up against the algorithm team sorry to go up against the Alam team this is my side so I've gone with Palmer and the I still have the same midfielder I still have guardal in defense and I still have Watkins and Harland in the forward line but the rest of the team has changed don't be deceived I've gone with Pedro and I've gone with Johnson I think Crystal Palace have looked pretty Naf so far this season I almost went with kazki him and Bowen have looked very very good from a creative standpoint so I was a little bit between those two but I did go with Johnson in the end just for the fact that I think he's missed chances and I think he could have put those away and his numbers might look even better if he'd been on the end of a few things that didn't actually go down registering as XG so I just like Johnson for this fixture but to be honest any of the Spurs attacking players you could go for I actually like the Midfield options more than salanki at the moment I think salanki hasn't looked particularly involved with what they've been doing so kesi Johnson and then obviously son if funds aren't an issue some great picks there gacho has looked very very good I'm glad he's starting as a Manchester United fan now in the united 11 uh from what I've seen of him on Thursday as well again driving forward runs into the box West Ham have Aaron raka who's very very good in oneon-one situations but you never know Val Mel might come in later on and gacho might do very well so I think that gacho if he's given a bit of more freedom in that game and isn't asked to hug the touch line too much then he could do some serious damage against West Ham and yeah I think United West Ham will maybe be a game that does have goals in at the London Stadium I've then gone with Rico Lewis instead of going with Edison just for kind of that thing that I think man city will probably concede I still have to back the numbers for them to get a clean sheet but I've just gone with him and then flecking and goal instead as a reversal of those kind of defenses and then Pedro again for kind of attacking threat and then I've gone with vissa up front so my punt of the week going with him returning from injury back into the brenford 11 hopefully they smash some goals in against Ipswich that's what I'm backing that's what I'm I'm kind of hoping will win me this week against the algorithm uh so yeah with all that said and done my 67 predicted points team hopefully it outscores let me know Down Below in the comments as always do you think my team will be the algorithm team for this week obviously the picks that are different are going to make the difference but finally the captaincy is the last thing we need to discuss we've both got the captain's armband on earling Harland let's see the two other options that I'd be considering for maybe this game we go [Music] right here we'll make this brief because to be honest I think if you got earing Harland which most people do at this point you have to Captain him uh 10.1 bid to points Palmer on 6.7 Ando on 6.1 the fixture is just 100% there I whichwich do actually have worse defensive numbers 2.36 expected goals conceded per 90 compared to 2.23 but there's not a huge amount in it Newcastle haven't looked massively poor on average 1.71 but you're comparing them here to two of the worst defenses in the league uh the two worst actually in fact so yeah I think that Palmer will do well in his fixture he's not the captain the option for this game week that stands out Ino likewise if you want to take a punt and you think earing harland's s rubbish and you want to back him being out of form and still continuing to stink up against Southampton den and buo I think it's probably your guy I'd say even though he's got a lower predicted points tally but yeah earling hland captaincy no doubt really in my mind triple captaincy maybe not I think I'd probably save it for a later game week if I still had the chip at this point pleas let me know Down Below in the comments if any of you are brave enough to do so so yeah that's going to wrap up another episode of Eddie versus the algorithm hopefully you guys are continuing to enjoy these ones if you did then please do smash a like on the video really does help us out here and yeah other than that I'll wish you the best of luck with this game week May your arrows be green and I'll see you goodbye

1,fantasyfootballfixYT,9pbirXtjqhQ,🔥 BUY PALMER or SON? | TOP Fantasy Premier League transfers 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 9 Guide,2024-10-24T10:00:17Z,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix YouTube video my name is FBO nacho and in today's video we are taking a look at the top transfers going into game week 9 in particular I want to cover off the best premium midfielder for your teams which Spurs midfielder to go for and of course the best defenders for your team so as always if you look forward today's video make sure you drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further Ado let's get into today's video [Music] so first up we need to talk about the best premium midfielder for your teams and the three players that we're going to be looking at right now are going to include Phil foden son and Cole Palmer and it's worth noting Cole Pama has had another price rise to 10.9 million so he really is the in demand midfielder for a lot of managers right now but these three midfielders all in their own right have a reason to be in your FPL teams I haven't included moala because of course he is in his own bracket when it comes to price point and it will be a player maybe we touch on in a future video but today we are focusing on foden son and Cole Palmer so first up I want to address Phil foden as an asset because in gameweek n and isolation I think he is the best option out of all of the three players at home against sath Hampton played in their Champions League fixture scored a goal and I would fully expect Phil foden to feature in gameweek 9 as a starter we know that Kevin De bruyne is still touch and go for gameweek 9 potentially back in gameweek 10 so I think the minutes for foden therefore are improved with that home game against Southampton and really based in terms of fixures there aren't many better games you can get than Southampton at home now look at the underly numbers I really want to take these with a pinch assault because we haven't really seen Phil foden much the season due to injury 0.15 XG per 90 not incredible .21 expected assists per 90 so you very much buying field foden on the basis of what we've seen last season and of course the fixture in hand outside of that I don't think he is a fantastic uh pick if you are going for just underlying numbers this season and if you're looking at a long-term option that is where I start to have slight concerns about Phil foden because son and Cole Palmer I know I'm getting guaranteed minutes from them foding in game weeks 10 11 and 12 I have no idea right now so foden I think is very much the best pick in gweek N but not a good long-term option when we compare it to the other pick so again let me know in the comments section if you're looking at a one gameweek punt that'll be Phil foden if we're looking longer term son and Co Palmer now when we take a look at the both of these here Palmer is just in a league of his own right now .54 expected goals per 90 0.55 expected assists per 90 basically double that of son that we have seen this season and the big chances Palmer's also accumulating at 0.92 per 90 minutes if I was in a situation right now where I didn't have a w card available even though the fixtures are very very poor for Chelsea some would argue I still would bring in Cole Palmer I really think that is the case Newcastle at home I don't think is a terrible fixture for Chelsea man united away we don't really know what man united team we are going to get and I still think Palmer can deliver in that fixture really Arsenal at home is going to be the one that isn't that good for Chelsea but then after that we know the fixtures longterm are fantastic and again the reason why I think the wild card is so important is because if you don't have it available I think Palmer in gameweek 12 regardless is going to need to come into your team so it just ends up not having to use an additional transfer to get to him later down the line and of course with his price potentially Rising again and again you might be picking him up at 11 million come game week 12 12 especially if you're not going for a player that has high upside as an alternative whose price could increase as well and I do think one of those could be son now with those fixtures coming up Palace away who are really poor this season I think is fine Aston Villa at home not an incredible fixture I'm going to be honest with you but with that high line that they play could we see son score absolutely and then I switch at home basically the money fixture for son in game week 11 and especially when we compare that to what Palmer has in that game week at home against Arsenal now of course after that man city away in gameweek 12 whereas it swings for Co Palmer that is where you definitely would jump from son to co Palmer and another reason why if you have your wild card available then I'll be more tempted to maybe swing towards son knowing that you can easily jump to co Palmer in gameweek 12 if you activate that wild card so basically on underline numbers right now and based on the long-term perspective I think Co Palmer is absolutely your man but if you have a wild card available and the potential of captaining son in game week 11 at home against IP switch means that I do like the option for son in your teams as a three game week Punt and then move into Cole Palmer foden for me is literally just a one we Punt and that is it then I think you are really rolling the dice in terms of his minutes so those are my thoughts let me know who is the best premium for you in the comment section the one caveat that we need to say about son is that there are alternatives in that team whereas Chelsea I think is Cole Palmer or nobody so taking into account son and those underlying numbers I now want to take a look at some alternative Spurs midfielders because this may actually be where we need to go rather than son himself so here we have got the underlying numbers for the Alternatives kulisy at 6.2 million Johnson at 6.7 million and Madison at 7.6 million so little bit of a price difference between all of these players but all of these being at least 2 million cheaper than that of son even the likes of Johnson and koseski are more than 3 million cheaper and what I think is really important in our FPL teams to keep that premium spot in the Midfield maybe the best alternative is actually having Co Palmer as your premium and one of these three as your Spurs attacker so take a look at the underline numbers right now because we know the fixtures they're great for the next three not very good in gameweek 12 in in terms of XG the pattern continues Brandon Johnson is still the man you want to get if you're accumulating big chances and great goal scoring opportunities 0.48 expected goals per 90 is double that of son again Johnson plays slightly more minutes than son but I really think that Brandon Johnson was unlucky not to deliver in gameweek eight and on another day Johnson picks up some returns son picks up some returns and we're starting to ask the question is son actually worth the 3 million more than brandan Johnson I think he's very much shortterm narrative that is making us very much go towards son rather than still look at Brandon Johnson as a pick now on the bonus points he isn't great bonus points this season are very much catering towards those players that do a lot and get fouled a lot hence where you can see kulesi and Madison decent on the bonus points per 90 there Madison in particular now the one that I want to quickly pay attention to is going to be kulesi because he's getting a lot of talk right now the cheapest of the Spurs midfielders at 6.2 with all the players now available for Spurs son playing off the right the left Brandon Johnson off the right salanki down the middle very much seeing the two1 being deployed by an in pretty much every fixture when we take a look at the numbers for kesesi 0.2 XG per 90 .27 expected assist per 90 decent underlying numbers not as good as that of James Madison's who is better in both of those departments but we need to remember this is a player that's 1.4 million cheaper than Madison and basically playing in the exact same position so first and foremost I think it's a case of is koseski better than Madison no I think the answer is no I still think Madison is better but when we take into account FPL value then yes I would still choose kulesi over Madison I think that 1.4 million saving that you can make is worthwhile and it would do a lot to your squad overall than just going for James Madison so Madison's great if you want to spend that extra you can but I think kesesi is better than him in terms of FPL saving so it very much comes down to kesesi versus Brandon Johnson and I still think Brandon Johnson is the man to go for yes koseski has many more Avenues to points I think he could actually get you know the bonus points the assists the goals Johnson very much is Just dependent on goals but in a team like Spurs who accumulating the most expected goals per game of any team I want the guy who scoring the goals and that Still Remains Brandon Johnson at 6.7 million so Johnson for me still the Spurs midfielder to go for but you are very much riing on this Spurs team clicking for him to get the returns otherwise if Spurs are struggling then it comes down to individual performances and that is where Madison and kulesi probably do step up because Johnson is just all about getting service in this team but hey when you got Madison and kesesi putting it on the plate for you I think Johnson will continue to get those returns in these games coming up the big thing is is it Johnson or son and that is a very difficult one to answer because son gives you the captaincy option in game week 11 at home against ipswitch I don't feel that confident putting the captaincy on Brandon Johnson and if we do find out that son is the penalty taker then that just elevates him into another plane where I think he is clearly the better pick and probably worth the 3 million more but look if you can't fit son in your team I still think Brandon Johnson is a fantastic alternative for your squads so last up in terms of the player comparisons I want to take a look at some attacking Defenders for our teams because un conscious that a lot of managers right now I'm maybe taking some money out of the defense to free up the funds to maybe get to some of these premiums that we discussed I'm seeing some managers sell the Lux of Trent some people are selling Robertson or some people in general are just looking at cheaper alternatives in the game so we've got exactly that we've got 8 Nori at 4.4 million we got pedr at 5.5 million and then of course we have vardal at 6.1 million so we've basically got price points at each range here depending on what direction you want to go in and when we're talking about cheap Defenders right now I think there are a lot available I think we've got Collins at brenford we got moleno at Everton but in terms of long-term FPL value I still think 8 Nori is the play mikeno probably for the clean sheets but I think 8 Nori when we look at the underlying numbers and I think we can see a slight Improvement in wolves going forward with these fixtures under gar o nil Brighton away I think is very difficult not a great entry point for 8 Nory but Palace at home Southampton at home F him away and the fixtures get good as we continue I think 8 Nori is a good player that will see his price increase as we progress through these fixtures and 0.21 XG per 90 is fantastic and 0.15 expected assist per 90 also great and you can see he actually outscoring the premiums in porro and vardal so when we take a look at a Nori as whole I really think this is a good player for you to downgrade if you have to I'm not sitting there saying you have to sell your Liverpool Defenders cuz I don't think of course eight Nory is going to outscore them but if it does free up the funds for you to go elsewhere with your team I think 8 Nori longterm is a great pick for this specific game week he might be a tricky play for your teams now when we take a look at the other two premiums porro and vardal porro very much one of those players that looks fantastic on the eye because as you can see shots per 90 2.0 1 so whenever you tunee into a Spurs game you will seeing him taking shots taking pop shots but when we look at the underly numbers that is where it's very clear these are very much long range pop shots he's having two shots per 90 but only 0.07 expected goals which basically indicates he is shooting from anywhere and not really getting into goal scoring opportunities but end of the day we have seen the has history of scoring these worldies and I think it could continue throughout the season 0.13 expected assists as well is decent as well and I think that will improve in these upcoming fixures that we are seeing in terms of actual FPL points slightly unlucky 3.51 um fpr points compared to the expected fpr points of 4.56 and I do think with the upcoming fixtures he could actually deliver a decent haul at some point either the IP switch game in particular looking like the money fixture so lastly we have vardal 6.1 million so basically the biggest premium outside of the Liverpool defender in Trent and maybe Gabrielle 0.13 expected goals 0.09 expected assists now first and foremost we need to say that this guy knows how to score bangers we talk about Pedro parro vardal is in another world now vardal is a great option absolutely and I think with the game at home against Southampton talk about double digit Halles I think that absolutely has the potential there but Bournemouth way after is proven to be a tough place to go for clean sheets then Brighton away I don't like that fixture in terms of clean sheets sheets and then Spurs at home so I don't actually think after the Southampton game there are many clean sheets a foot for gardial and Nathan AI has returned we featured in the Champions League game I SP still expect Vel to play in gameweek N but we could see some rotation depending on the fixture and depending on what type of player um pep wants to play so I still think viio was a great investment especially for gameweek nine but I feel like maybe the ship has sailed a little bit for him and I don't think you need to expect him to score every single week because they are turning out to be worldies and the underlying numbers aren't amazing compared to that of even like a 8 Nori for example so all in all I think 8 Nori is a brilliant option to go to Long Term if you're looking to free up the funds Pedro parro is absolutely the short-term punt if you want to chase upside and I think vardal is great if you want to play for a safe Defender but with Man City still leaking goals outside of game week N9 I don't love him long term so finally we need to take a look at these gameweek nine predicted points because end of the day if you have earling Howland you have to put the capy on him I spoke about this last week away against wolves I felt like it was probably the best Captain but there still was some doubt because wolves are where you just don't really know what you're getting this week if Howen doesn't deliver I think we just all put our hands up and say it was the right pick just one of those game weeks because 10.1 predicted points I just don't think you could look past it if you don't have Pand then of course the other players come into the come into their own but if you own Harland how can you not put the captaincy on him so he is in another world put him in would have we buying Haren the other question the answer is going to be no I don't think if you own him you should be buying him for this one specific game week because we can see a situation where they go 40 up hen scores one and comes off early so if you don't own howand I just wouldn't buy him I would just grin and Barett but this week you abs absolutely have to Harland Captain the big question mark is do we triple Captain Harland because 10.1 predicted points I doubt we're going to see much better this season outside of a double game week with double game weeks being few and far between this season which has been announced and later on this year when they do get announced are we actually going to see the player that we truly want getting an ideal double game week so for me if you're looking to Triple Captain I think this is probably the week to do so I think the fixture is too damn good 10.1 now we will get some midfielders who have equally good games and do I prefer captain and midfielder over Harland yes I do but with the triple Captain available in gameweek 9 with a player like Harland who has such a ridiculous ceiling I think triple captain on Highland absolutely needs to be considered and I think a lot of the community will do so the closer we get to that Friday night deadline outside of Highland then I think Cole Palmer is the leading one 6.7 I don't love the the idea of a buo captain but he is looking good on the predicted points at 6.1 then we have the likes of Ole Watkins and then the Man City pack in gundo vardal Edison Savio Salah always appears on these lists so to conclude Highland I think is a brilliant trible cap the option 10.1 predicted points is outrageous and I really think he should be considered for your teams it just comes down to if you're waiting for a double game week but then you need to remember we still have a lot of chips to play with the bench boost and the Mystery chip if you don't have Harland then I do think Cole Palmer is the next best alternative for your team so thanks so much for tuning today's video really hope to provided some value if you have any questions put them in the comment section we'll be sure to answer them and of course you enjoyed the video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button and I will see you in the next one take care cheers oh,3451,3368,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is fbo nacho and in todays video we are taking a look at the top transfers going into game week 9 in particular i want to cover off the best premium midfielder for your teams which spurs midfielder to go for and of course the best defenders for your team so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up we need to talk about the best premium midfielder for your teams and the three players that were going to be looking at right now are going to include phil foden son and cole palmer and its worth noting cole pama has had another price rise to 109m so he is the in demand midfielder for a lot of managers right now but these three midfielders all in their own right have a reason to be in your fpl teams i havent included moala because of course he is in his own bracket when it comes to price point and it will be a player maybe we touch on in a future video but today we are focusing on foden son and cole palmer so first up i want to address phil foden as an asset because in gw n and isolation i think he is the best option out of all of the three players at home against sath hampton played in their champions league fixture scored a goal and i would fully expect phil foden to feature in gw 9 as a starter we know that kevin de bruyne is still touch and go for gw 9 potentially back in gw 10 so i think the minutes for foden therefore are improved with that home game against southampton and based in terms of fixures there arent many better games you can get than southampton at home now look at the underly numbers i want to take these with a pinch assault because we havent seen phil foden much the season due to injury 015 xg per 90 not incredible 21 expected assists per 90 so you buying field foden on the basis of what weve seen last season and of course the fixture in hand outside of that i dont think he is a fantastic pick if you are going for just underlying numbers this season and if youre looking at a longterm option that is where i start to have slight concerns about phil foden because son and cole palmer i know im getting guaranteed minutes from them foding in game weeks 10 11 and 12 i have no idea right now so foden i think is the best pick in gweek n but not a good longterm option when we compare it to the other pick so again let me know in the comments section if youre looking at a one gw punt thatll be phil foden if were looking longer term son and co palmer now when we take a look at the both of these here palmer is just in a league of his own right now 54 expected goals per 90 055 expected assists per 90 double that of son that we have seen this season and the big chances palmers also accumulating at 092 per 90 minutes if i was in a situation right now where i didnt have a w card available even though the fixtures are very poor for chelsea some would argue i still would bring in cole palmer i think that is the case newcastle at home i dont think is a terrible fixture for chelsea man united away we dont know what man united team we are going to get and i still think palmer can deliver in that fixture arsenal at home is going to be the one that isnt that good for chelsea but then after that we know the fixtures longterm are fantastic and again the reason why i think the wild card is so important is because if you dont have it available i think palmer in gw 12 regardless is going to need to come into your team so it just ends up not having to use an additional transfer to get to him later down the line and of course with his price potentially rising again and again you might be picking him up at 11m come game week 12 especially if youre not going for a player that has high upside as an alternative whose price could increase as well and i do think one of those could be son now with those fixtures coming up palace away who are poor this season i think is fine aston villa at home not an incredible fixture im going to be honest with you but with that high line that they play could we see son score absolutely and then i switch at home the money fixture for son in game week 11 and especially when we compare that to what palmer has in that game week at home against arsenal now of course after that man city away in gw 12 whereas it swings for co palmer that is where you definitely would jump from son to co palmer and another reason why if you have your wild card available then ill be more tempted to maybe swing towards son knowing that you can easily jump to co palmer in gw 12 if you activate that wild card so on underline numbers right now and based on the longterm perspective i think co palmer is absolutely your man but if you have a wild card available and the potential of captaining son in game week 11 at home against ip switch means that i do like the option for son in your teams as a three game week punt and then move into cole palmer foden for me is just a one we punt and that is it then i think you are rolling the dice in terms of his minutes so those are my thoughts let me know who is the best premium for you in the comment section the one caveat that we need to say about son is that there are alternatives in that team whereas chelsea i think is cole palmer or nobody so taking into account son and those underlying numbers i now want to take a look at some alternative spurs midfielders because this may be where we need to go rather than son himself so here we have got the underlying numbers for the alternatives kulisy at 62m johnson at 67m and madison at 76m so little bit of a price difference between all of these players but all of these being at least 2m cheaper than that of son even the likes of johnson and koseski are more than 3m cheaper and what i think is important in our fpl teams to keep that premium spot in the midfield maybe the best alternative is having co palmer as your premium and one of these three as your spurs attacker so take a look at the underline numbers right now because we know the fixtures theyre great for the next three not very good in gw 12 in terms of xg the pattern continues brandon johnson is still the man you want to get if youre accumulating big chances and great goal scoring opportunities 048 expected goals per 90 is double that of son again johnson plays slightly more minutes than son but i think that brandon johnson was unlucky not to deliver in gw eight and on another day johnson picks up some returns son picks up some returns and were starting to ask the question is son worth the 3m more than brandan johnson i think hes shortterm narrative that is making us go towards son rather than still look at brandon johnson as a pick now on the bonus points he isnt great bonus points this season are catering towards those players that do a lot and get fouled a lot hence where you can see kulesi and madison decent on the bonus points per 90 there madison in particular now the one that i want to quickly pay attention to is going to be kulesi because hes getting a lot of talk right now the cheapest of the spurs midfielders at 62 with all the players now available for spurs son playing off the right the left brandon johnson off the right salanki down the middle seeing the two1 being deployed by an in pretty much every fixture when we take a look at the numbers for kesesi 02 xg per 90 27 expected assist per 90 decent underlying numbers not as good as that of james madisons who is better in both of those departments but we need to remember this is a player thats 14m cheaper than madison and playing in the exact same position so first and foremost i think its a case of is koseski better than madison no i think the answer is no i still think madison is better but when we take into account fpl value then yes i would still choose kulesi over madison i think that 14m saving that you can make is worthwhile and it would do a lot to your squad overall than just going for james madison so madisons great if you want to spend that extra you can but i think kesesi is better than him in terms of fpl saving so it comes down to kesesi versus brandon johnson and i still think brandon johnson is the man to go for yes koseski has many more avenues to points i think he could get the bonus points the assists the goals johnson is just dependent on goals but in a team like spurs who accumulating the most expected goals per game of any team i want the guy who scoring the goals and that still remains brandon johnson at 67m so johnson for me still the spurs midfielder to go for but you are riing on this spurs team clicking for him to get the returns otherwise if spurs are struggling then it comes down to individual performances and that is where madison and kulesi probably do step up because johnson is just all about getting service in this team but hey when you got madison and kesesi putting it on the plate for you i think johnson will continue to get those returns in these games coming up the big thing is it johnson or son and that is a very difficult one to answer because son gives you the captaincy option in game week 11 at home against ipswitch i dont feel that confident putting the captaincy on brandon johnson and if we do find out that son is the penalty taker then that just elevates him into another plane where i think he is clearly the better pick and probably worth the 3m more but look if you cant fit son in your team i still think brandon johnson is a fantastic alternative for your squads so last up in terms of the player comparisons i want to take a look at some attacking defenders for our teams because un conscious that a lot of managers right now im maybe taking some money out of the defense to free up the funds to maybe get to some of these premiums that we discussed im seeing some managers sell the lux of trent some people are selling robertson or some people in general are just looking at cheaper alternatives in the game so weve got exactly that weve got 8 nori at 44m we got pedr at 55m and then of course we have vardal at 61m so weve got price points at each range here depending on what direction you want to go in and when were talking about cheap defenders right now i think there are a lot available i think weve got collins at brenford we got moleno at everton but in terms of longterm fpl value i still think 8 nori is the play mikeno probably for the clean sheets but i think 8 nori when we look at the underlying numbers and i think we can see a slight improvement in wolves going forward with these fixtures under gar o nil brighton away i think is very difficult not a great entry point for 8 nory but palace at home southampton at home f him away and the fixtures get good as we continue i think 8 nori is a good player that will see his price increase as we progress through these fixtures and 021 xg per 90 is fantastic and 015 expected assist per 90 also great and you can see he outscoring the premiums in porro and vardal so when we take a look at a nori as whole i think this is a good player for you to downgrade if you have to im not sitting there saying you have to sell your liverpool defenders cuz i dont think of course eight nory is going to outscore them but if it does free up the funds for you to go elsewhere with your team i think 8 nori longterm is a great pick for this specific game week he might be a tricky play for your teams now when we take a look at the other two premiums porro and vardal porro one of those players that looks fantastic on the eye because as you can see shots per 90 20 1 so whenever you tunee into a spurs game you will seeing him taking shots taking pop shots but when we look at the underly numbers that is where its very clear these are long range pop shots hes having two shots per 90 but only 007 expected goals which indicates he is shooting from anywhere and not getting into goal scoring opportunities but end of the day we have seen the has history of scoring these worldies and i think it could continue throughout the season 013 expected assists as well is decent as well and i think that will improve in

deliver a decent haul at some point either the ip switch game in particular looking like the money fixture so lastly we have vardal 61m so the biggest premium outside of the liverpool defender in trent and maybe gabrielle 013 expected goals 009 expected assists now first and foremost we need to say that this guy knows how to score bangers we talk about pedro parro vardal is in another world

2,fantasyfootballfixYT,vA87s5k70mI,🔥 FPL ELITE TEAM REVEAL | HAALAND HYPE HALTED | Fantasy Premier League 2024/25 GAMEWEEK 9 Preview,2024-10-23T11:01:08Z,hi everyone and welcome back to the fantasy footballfix.com YouTube channel with me Tom Camel for another Elite 11 team reveal we've got Craig back on the channel for the first time in what seems like forever he's having a great season so I'm looking forward to getting his thoughts we're going to be discussing what to do with earling Harland all of the stats going into gameweek N9 and looking back to gameweek eight so without further Ado guys let's get right into it guys welcome back to the channel I'm Craig great to have you back back on mate it's been ages how's your how's your season working out my friend it's going very well Tom thanks for having me back on it's been a while um it was it was preseason when I was last gone I think it was just before game week one if I recall correctly wow really okay yeah yeah because I seem to recall saying that I was I was looking ahead to Triple captaining Harland in game week two um and and I did it um and everything was going great at that point so um and it's it's going to wee bit downhill since but I mean still pretty decent score I think so I'm really happy with the season so far yeah definitely you can see that Mak swimming a right around that kind of 140 odd k Mark at this stage of the season is is really strong position so looking back in that case G CR because we've not had you on is there anything that's kind of happened in the first eight game we period which has surprised you and has has kind of gone against what you were expecting um how it went obviously the crewing of transfers is new how are you kind of finding how The Season's panning out is it a is it a crapshoot is it going as you expected how would you kind of sum things up right let's start with the last one it's not going as expected um not at all um I don't actually feel like I've got a whole lot right I think I've got two things right since start of the Season which I'm pretty happy with apart from that everything's been a bit of a crapshoot as you call it so I started with I started with Salah and harand at the start and that worked out great for the first three weeks I triple captained Harland in two game um so that works out really well obviously I'm super happy with that um but since then well I haven't done a lot since then because up until last week had accumulated accumulated excuse me four fre transfers wild carded in six but rolled over a few transfers and they were starting to burn a hole in my pocket so last week I spent a few not very wisely as it turns out um and um I've I've been struggling string really to get my head around the new value of a free transfer struggling to get my head around it feels to me I'm not the huge stats guy but it feels to me this year that the stats are know that they're so heavily weighted on last year's performance and this year's performances are quite different it seems particularly from certain individuals so it's um I'm finding I'm stumbling a we bit the score's fine I'm doing okay don't get me wrong but it doesn't feel like I'm completely in control a we bit like a CO right now so um I get it yeah that's it yeah well summed up and I think a lot of managers are find are feeling the same way as well not just the guys who you know have had on with the theark and and and Andrew um Cory Etc but more widely people are still sort of say still working our way through this aren't we we're only eight game weeks in but score wise is looking is looking super uh impressive Craig so that's something to to be holding on to I reckon we should take a look Craig how your game week 8 played out you mentioned you had bunch of free transfers going into game week 8 so let's take a look at how you used them and how many points you manag to pick up okay mate so we're going to do this sort of piece by piece we're going to start with a goalkeeper reveal here which I know the scores cuz preparing for this as a nice way to start isn't it mate Mr saling go there the Nottingham Forest goalkeeper nice cheap option with an 11o Hall got to be super happy with how that's working I'm ridiculously happy I mean I I I was one of those who got I think many did stumbled on that Wild Card Saturday morning with the is rare fit is rare not fit and um oh yeah and I seem to think you and I have talked about this chat before but I was wise enough to bring in Edison again um his name does seem to follow you around ha fantasy asset but there we Go's he's like he's like the the bar of soap in a prison film you know you you know exactly what's going to happen when you bend down and pick it up and yet you keep on doing it you know so at least I do so quite an analogy yeah excuse me so it's um I took the chance to move him out this week um I'm not at all oh wow beautiful not at all blown away by well nobody is by by City this season particularly not defensively they always have always have had uh a goal against in them despite you know incredibly low XGC numbers and um I just had enough it's just such a drag owning him and um and I needed some money from somewhere so um Sals came in for him and delivered I think more points in one week than Edison so that was great yeah it's great and and and you know a shout out for for the forest defense collectively right Craig I mean you and I have talked I've certainly talked to to Mark as well and they they were appearing at sort of posit postively as a team defensive unit at the back end of last season that's continued right into the start start of the season so they look they look viable let's take a look at the rest of the defense and how they're looking up so you got Trent Alexander Arnold there Gabrielle obviously G sort of Premium teams there CRA we can look at the bench there as well mikeno and and gree respectively as they how are you feeling about that defensive contingent ongoing with some some some serious investment there with with Trent and and Gabrielle what's your what's your thoughts thoughts on your defensive setup so far I think Trent I I still feel that he's a gift and that's what I felt at the start of the season I think the price is still too low obviously they've got a few fixes coming up which are a bit funky so maybe he's not going to be getting a clean sheet and an assist and and three bonus points but um but he's had a few of those and I I'm going to do whatever I can to keep him going forwards interesting okay I don't think there were too many premium Defenders who were delivering right now or any Defenders would living right now apart from forest perhaps um so so he's he stays for now I'm really happy with him Gabrielle I suppose we're going to get the transfer plans during the the chat so um he's on thin ice um short term at least Lewis kind of goes back to the point about um Edison I don't feel when I'm watching them all I'm looking at the numbers afterwards that they're a particularly safe bet these days were clean sheet but the attraction of Lewis is one he's he's Dirt Cheap or he was at Le Dirt Cheap when I bought him and secondly he does have that attacking potential on his locker oh yeah um okay this week it was it was gradi who who chipped in but another week it could quite easily be Lewis so I'm for that price I'm happy to go with him over another 4.5 so yeah makes sense I don't really see him as a premium Defender I see him as a 4.5 he's got that added bonus of one of these days City will smash somebody 5 nil and he might be tipping in with a few attacking points so so that's for me he's just I like it and option and and mikeno on the bench there obviously returning from injury in game week eight after that missing out previously and they they've I think I'm beaten in four now as well so it looks like a nice route into um an I guess an improving Everton defense would we go that far or do we still not trust them just yet absolutely yeah no yeah I don't trust them as much as others but I do trust them put this way the the form they had at the start of the season was not representative of what you're GNA get from going forward so uh whether they're the best defense no probably not but um I think at that price we probably all bought him at which was 4.3 well what do you want it's fine he's going to deliver some weeks some weeks not yeah here cool let's look on to the Midfield then mate so we we're looking here at um mumo foden Rogers and seeno who was massively stats padding wasn't in terms of everything other than scoring or assisting or gaining any FPL points but everything else he was lighting things up let's talk around this this this Midfield selection obviously sacka missed out because of the um the injury that kept him out of the squad all together at Bournemouth how you feeling about your Midfield five Craig let's start with foden let's start let's start with Phil yeah okay so so I I brought foden in this week I I Got a Boner for Phil and I really wanted to bring him in for these games last last week against wolves and this week against who was it this week Southampton isn't it this week that's right oh yeah yeah um so that seemed too good to be true and yeah it just didn't Factor pep into the equation so I really really hadn't expected to see him on the bench again this week so that's okay he chipped in with an assist for the JN Stones goal fine uh but it feels a bit of a A Sucker Punch but at the same time um I wasn't considering son um unlike the cartel and what have you um it wasn't an option for me it just it really hadn't I'd looked at Johnson I wasn't really hot on Johnson I'd looked at Madison I was if I was gone for somebody from Spurs it would have been Madison um but I didn't get that far in my process of thought because I much much preferred the idea of fen so Fen came in yeah which makes total sense for Lis Diaz I think it was Diaz Diaz didn't play so yeah that was I mean you would have thought as well Craig with de bruyer continued absence as well and we'll kind of come on and talk at length about Harland and and the seeming lack of creativity that's massively inut impacting on his output that foden would have been as close to a lock in that Guardiola Midfield and attack as certainly High Sly understand it so Ando obviously he's had a cracking start to the season man united haven't been impressive have they so you I guess would have been confident with the game at Old Trafford but um one of the few games where they didn't look so impressive what are your feelings about mumo Ono and brenford as an attacking option yeah but I think it's been a few games now where has at least I haven't only seen really short highlights so it's not an eye test at all but from the numbers side he hasn't really been showing any leg uh there hasn't really been a great deal of um okay of either expected goals or expected assists for the last few and it's got me a little bit worried I mean um as it kind of intimated at the start I'm not trusting all the numbers I'm seeing at least in terms of the algorithms and you know FPL review and yeah yours on the on the fantasy football fix site I mean you know they're based upon historic data and I'm seeing I just feel like there's some anomalies between the historic data and the way players are performing right now bourma is one of those top of my list of I mean going forward he should be an absolute lock and I think most people you know if you haven't got him you really should why not but at the same time I don't know I don't have any confidence about um can't quite tell you why it's just a gut feeling but um um and it's at that price point Craig isn't it where where um there are always going to be compelling options week to week in that kind of I don't know what we'd call it sort of mid to uper mid price bracket there's always someone of interest it seems game week to game week so it's quite easy to get um itchy feet isn't it with with with players like that it is it is but I mean I know I just I made these three moves this this week and that was easy because I had four frees but the ones you really want to be moving around at least the ones I want to be M moving around ideally the big hitting guys okay um I don't mind using transfers on the son well I didn't but you know but the sons the sackers the Salas the fodes um and so on but but I don't I don't see him B in that bracket so I don't really want to use transfers on that a menu or B kind player you want to just pick them and and leave them there but yeah it's only two weeks since I wild carded but I've got to yeah okay to watch itch to be scratched all right well we're going to come on a look at at game week n in a moment so we'll talk around transfer plans then but in terms of your more budget enabling and we'll talk around the sacka plan as well in in the game week N Slide as well Craig so we'll leave him for now but Rogers NE return Villa looked good impressive a away win at Fulham and SE menu as I say sort of lit things up other than from actually returning FPL points pretty comfortable with those two budget options Craig they feel like the popular Duo yeah certainly certainly Rogers I'm struggling to think of anybody who's um better value at that price on on my wild card I there was a there was a few hours there where I was looking at Calo from um from brenford um but I I feel reasonably happy with with that choice of Rogers and I needed I think most people doing I need needed a cheap I call him seventh or eight or fourth or fifth midfielder and he I can't see anybody better I'm not saying he's gonna turn into a 150 Point guy this season none at all but um it it seems it's a gift I like him I like how he plays man it's it's fun to watch him it's s fun to see an attacker dribbling and taking people on and and willing to shoot and stuff it's a bit of a throwback to yester year and he seems like a viable FPL option doesn't he especially at that price so yeah I understand that one let's look at these forwards they make so we're going to come on and talk at length about Harland so I don't think we need to belabor that captaincy blank there but I am interested in your read on Dominic salanki obviously in a lot of people's team Spurs have got a really handsome run of fixtures haven't they and they thrashed a pitiful West Ham which it's always difficult for me to to watch but um he didn't impressed right and seemed to be one of the few attacking options in that game who who who wasn't presenting much of a case what's your read on sank I thought he played okay but just not as an FPL okay um and again I'm seeing the highlights not the full game but from what I saw you know he seem to work well with the team he put others into play which is fantastic just from an FPL point of view it's just like stop passing the bloody ball yeah um so um and he was a little bit like that I mean the week before he was better but there's been a few of those games right that this season where you know he seemed like this foil at the top of of the um yeah of the formation for bringing the others in which is which is fine and maybe I should have given that more thought before I brought him in this week because I'm I'm really already regretting it I mean they have a really nice game week 11 but that's still a few weeks away MH um but that feels that one feels like a mistake um foden foden when on the pitch is always going to be dangerous um s lank I can't quite say the same just after one week of being another so I'm feeling a little bit of buyers regret there yeah know and I should should qualify that thought we played well as well it's was just you know FPL relevant in terms of what what you want to see there in terms of shot volume and and and and metrics like that let's talk around DCL um we mentioned Everton improving um four I think it's four unbeaten now in the league and he remains there there forward doesn't he but what's going on with this guy Craig what's what's what's your take on him he Great Value in in theory is it is it to stay the course with him because of his price what's your what's your take I think I think unless you have transfers to burn I've got I would very much doubt you got transfers to burn with G 12 coming thick and fast um by which I me to say a fixture screen fix SC um then I I'm a little bit sorry to say I'm stuck with the useless bastard um it really doesn't feel like I've made the right choice there I think he felt like the right choice at the time but he really hasn't posted any decent numbers or any really eye-catching performances or he hasn't really looked like um you know it doesn't like Seena where at least you think well you know one of those could maybe have gone in the video is so so little from Calvin lean but it feels a wee bit like I'm stuck with him for a while anyway um but as long as I can restructure that he becomes my first sub and not a player I'm depending on in the first then okay fine move yeah and me that's a good segue actually Craig so I think with that in mind let's take a look at how your bus team is shaping up ahead of game week nine okay so you sort of alluded to it there CRA let's get straight into the the bench here actually so you've decided here we want to talk around what your plans are with sacka injury news pending but the idea to bench calv Leen and moleno for a home game against Fulham sort of stood out to me here Craig because I think they've they've we' just talked around them looking slightly more encouraging um is it just the fact that the rest of your team is is strong enough to Warrant that or do you just say Everton are actually not a team we should be trusting from an FPL perspective at the moment let's look at the defense let's look at the start with the defense um first of all we've got Trent and he's going nowhere course that that for me is a it's got Z zero WR all over it and um and even if it wasn't I would I wouldn't bench Trent there's Lewis home to Southampton assuming he plays and then there's Gabrielle who may or may not be in my team Come Saturday Morning um so it might be let not yeah I'm not sure what we get into plans but who person you got two free trans right yeah so it could well be Saka certainly could be sacka at TOA but I haven't got money um so I need a um I need a I need a make weight um and Gabrielle could be the one will probably be the one it would be ideal if it was calv but I haven't got the money to go to himis from Fulham and Palmer so somebody else has to make way so it's going to be well who' it be there's four candidates it's GNA be Gabrielle SEO solank or U um and I'm tempted to go for G I'll lose a few quid on Gabrielle by selling him but I don't mind um feels like an interesting time sorry so no I think I'll probably go for Gabrielle to probably a NRI okay um who I would bench this week and then put Michel Eno in um and then I NRI comes and starts delivering the points from game week 10 when their fixure round starts going really fantastic I like it I like the player as well like Nori and wolves you know they're hard done by again weren't they depending on how you look at it in the man tit game but um yeah I like him as an FPL option really interesting so interesting that we're talking about moving away from from Arsenal as a as a double move then with these they' got three rough fixtures now right with over the next over the next three and off the back of a defeat against um against Bournemouth do we think actually that strategically is what you'd be recommending like actually Arsenal are a bit of a a swerve for now I mean no I wouldn't recommend it uh in so far as it's just where I'm at right now and um it goes hand inand with some of the other priorities I've got for the next few weeks which I guess we're going to get onto yeah um but but no I mean I still think Arsenal I mean if you look at the numbers and it's all completely skewed because they've had three red cards I still think their hands down the best defense in the league okay um so there's nothing to say that they couldn't get uh three clean sheets or three decent results in the next few games it's just much more unlikely than it's likely um but from game week 12 we're all going to want them back um two probably three uh moving on toward Christmas so um it's just a temporary switching around so sacka will leave this week for Palmer yeah um for the very simple reason that I'm quite terrified of not having pal I'm not going to try and give you some stats or any kind of sophisticated well we'll come on to some in a minute right when we'll see we'll see his name up in light won't we yeahh um and then Gabrielle will come back in 12 along with Saka I say Gabrielle it could also be oh I forgotten his name the Left Bank Italian guy yeah me too um I know who you mean yeah the new signing I know who you mean yeah yeah C well well remembered yeah so an Arsenal defensive becomes viable from 12 yeah I get it yeah yeah yeah so it's just moving things around right now to chase some of the players who've got the really big weeks coming up um so that's um yeah timer could be any week that that's the fear um game week 10 is s and Trent that's their time to shine game week 11 we've got son and drum rolls aany um and then 12 well it's wide open then it's just Arsenal and Chelsea all the to Christmas just City Games thrown in Craig did did you have any thoughts on you mentioned Salah there as well I thought another very impressive performance they just they just take them as red now and salad sort of gives these performances you know it's been for so long from an FPL perspective have you got any designs on on trying to squeeze him back into the team even if it would be a part of a hit or or how does no yes absolutely yeah absolutely what's the plan then let's talk around the mo the mosala plan for you well okay um you can't have them all no you know we've been saying this since start of the Season they've priced it absolutely fantastically uh this season um here I think oh me too um so I'm not moving Trent I want Saka I want Palmer if I want Salah then someone's gonna have to give I see I think we all know who it is so um yeah okay so it's just a question of um and and the only thing I'm trying to make I have really got so far down to planning out on my posted notes like I normally do but I've got a rough idea in my head that who will go and come in in which order and as long as I've got a route like as long as I've got a minus four back to Harland yeah you know I mean if if Salah breaks his knee and then har scores a hatrick he like oh my God as long as I can just with with one move or two moves with a minus four get Harlem back the next week fine I'm happy to take that risk um that that's kind of where I feel right now because City just don't I'm not I'm not seeing it when I'm watching them I don't see a cohesive unit I don't see it's like um what's that cartoon is it what do you call that in English is it find Wally or where's W where W you know it's like yeah it's like the easiest game in the world you know for Manchester City where's Harland like he's just stood there doing nothing waiting for someone to pass him the ball this is a spoiler for us which they can't seem to work out how to do but I mean it's um yeah just final thing on the transer plans ahead of game week n You' got the two were expecting Palmer to come in for for sacka and they're being a make quate Cory in the slack channel was making the point as to Gabrielle having a you know a bit of goal threat there is there any thought you mentioned not being enamored by salanki to actually do something with him to make make funds and if so what would that move double move look like Craig yeah it's funny you mention that because I think in all honesty it's like um uh what is it from PP fixtion that's just Pride with you but you know I've just brought salanki in um and I feel like a bit of a mug if I take him out this the week after but but you're probably right that in all honesty you know looking ahead for where I want to be then it probably saves me um a transfer going forward sometime in the next five weeks if I just sell Salan now if I sell salanki now uh I think there would only be two and again it's not for a direct replacement it's for how muchoney I would need to raise in the weeks ahead so it's only two choices it would be gimenez or it would be kuna if shiao Pedro was fit I would consider him uh but I'm pretty sure he comes in for calv lein as soon as he's fit um so kuna or Jimenez would be my move for solank which would give me plenty of money in the bank to play around with the other moves I have planned you got a um a expectation which way you're leaning which one will be the make weake to to enable Palmer to come in Craig if it was more likely to be Gabrielle or solanky which way are you leaning at the minute well it was Gabrielle one minute ago but what do you think Tom I I just thought when you mentioned about the thought the thought you're going to be bringing an Arsenal defender back in 12 my financial analyst background to me suggests that you might want to retain someone who you've already got money in so I'd probably be leaning more towards salanki as the as the option particularly as I love Ral gimenez and I'm super impressed by him as and that is actually a lovely little segue onto our stats round up for the last four game weeks guys so this is probably my favorite part of the show guys that we've been bringing in for the last few videos actually and this is just a reminder it's looking at the last four game weeks uh stats are you know average per per game and they need to have played uh at least 180 minutes um over the course of the season so this is what we're looking at here and there are some interesting names here aren't they Greg when we were talking off camera and some some stunning revelations in the expected goals conceded from uh Team metric I had to run them twice you asked my boss whether or not I'd gone crazy because West Ham are in there so I like that doesn't feel right but um what's leaping out to you here mate I mean you've talked around Palmer already the stats seem to be backing that up right he's he's looking like a tremendous tremendous FPL asset even with the the good pricing that you mentioned as well yeah I mean the for the goals and assists there's no surprises in the goals that kind of well a little bit with with solanki given the given the narrative had last four only been paying attention for the last two really so that's that's perhaps where it coms on I mean him andz being up and forth him and as you know appears in different places here I mean he seems I mean he's certainly The Purple Patch yeah he is so um it seems to be the right time to to hit on him the other one the other one which really really jumped out um is Kudos yeah um and okay he's suspended now silly boy um but I think most of us would have been looking at West Ham Assets in a few week time um and not right now but but every you know every time I see West Ham mention everyone's always saying oh you know Bow's the only asset not not not decrying Bo as an FP asset quite the opposite you know obviously got a huge long pedigree but k his numbers man I mean they're really really really interesting obviously they're going to go south in a rush now but he's not going to be on the pitch but um but it's worth remembering for when he comes back from suspension it is mate and and when the pictures pick up I mean he's really really interested me with these numbers here yeah and and and he should be right I mean he was he was predicted to to to do well this season as well I think it was either 15 or 16 goal involvements last season as well he's a terrific player I love watching him play and he does it does translate to fpl points and we've we've seen that over a period now but as you say he's gone and got himself sent off that rules him out of the the game against man united in gameweek nine and and out of people's thinking for this period but a nice shout ahead of um fixture change down down the line as well for sure yeah I mean someone who's conspicuous by their absence here um Craig is is is Harland right um yeah expected goals we mentioned I mentioned last video with Andrew that he was not there but he was appearing in the shots and shots in the Box volume so we were kind of bit more relaxed about things it disappeared from there and actually I I took the time to look and he has over the last four game weeks and we'll come on to look at him in a minute but over the last four his expected goals per 90 is that is the equivalent of Leandro Martinez of Man United Center half Fame so that sort of tells you where where he's at right so I mean we're going to get onto Harland in detail in a minute but just outside of that there anybody else that's on this screen here that's you're sort of thinking they present an interesting case um sacka still super high I mean if he was if he was deemed fit for example would you say there's a case to keep him ahead of your Palmer move or is Palmer still just I think I think the fixtures they've got are just too yeah Ry too tight yeah to to not take a chance on SOS son or Palmer in those three weeks and so yeah I mean I haven't really made that much money on him I don't think I was just checking yesterday doesn't like Gabrielle got quite a bit tied up but um for me that that's straight I think that the seeding is so high on the other players at a period where his seeding is going to be relatively lower than what it is then I I feel intensely relaxed about moving him out uh going forwards um understood mate yeah so yeah that's not an issue for me there at all um you've got me really cooking now on this solanky thing I can't get out of my head that's interesting I wasn't expecting to see him in the expected goals there as well so maybe my my enthusiasm to ditch him has sort of being offset by that a little bit so it's a fair point mud the water has let's just to talk real quickly on the expected goals conceded some some funny n team names in there right Spurs Bourn North West Ham Villa and Fulham respectively impressing over the last four from that particular metric teams there in terms of budget friendly options do do do you think they represent a route into freeing up those precious funds Craig any team that you think oh they FPL options I'd be interested in yeah two of them but funnily enough not the first three okay um so Villa and Fulham have been a little bit on my radar in terms of this money finding exercise I'm going through uh in the weeks ahead yeah V I still think con he didn't play this weekend which is a bit cheeky because I think um Emory gave the indication that he would play but whatever I think coner I had him from the start of the season I still think he's the standout Choice from their defense m uh Fulham I had Robinson from the start um and I I seem to think he picked up one return in the second week or something his numbers are actually yeah but his numbers his attacking numbers are really really poor I know his heat map looks like a thing of you know thing of beauty um but his you know his end product is is really really poor so I think um I know Cory's got the hot room um is um Yin Anderson Anderson Fulham who's unless he's gone up in price he was 4.3 uh earlier in the week so that seems if if if um if Robinson is all fart and no poop then I think he may as well just save the money and go for Anderson yeah like um who can also be a set piece to so those two are the ones I would go for from from those two West Ham fixtures nah I'm not going there for now um but more than happy to look at them 13 14 onwards Spurs yeah I was found found that peculiar to find them there as well I mean Pedro is the name that leaps out from when we've talked historically about them but pay a bit more for him what you read on Tottenham as FPL defensive options I mean I'm absolutely Gob smacked to see them at the top of this list absolutely Blown Away um parro I don't find to be anywhere near as interesting an option as he was last season even though I didn't own him that much last season but you know he's offset pieces yeah he's getting forward but not in the same way as he was last season and they look more fragile uh to to my know more fragile but but they they still look fragile they still like they've got a crazy capitulation in them um yeah I didn't see the game but I listened to the Brion game oh that famous second yeah I had that on I was back in the UK for the first time in a while so I had that in five live on a long drive down from Scotland and um and that was quite that was quite entertaining listening to it being described in audio um bad I I think they've it's always my gut feeling and it's not fair it's not statistically based it's emotionally based but I always feel they've got that stupid banana peel slip up in them um so I'm I'm looking at that 1.02 and shaking my head and you know I'm I'm not tempted to go there and if I was it wouldn't be it wouldn't be P would be probably one of the two center backs yeah van some like that Romero yeah so but I'm not I mean it's going back to my my plans if I don't Michel Leno they still have and okay they're not on that table I'm curious if they're six but um they're not on the table but their fixtures are solid going forward and they rotate really well with um with Wolves interesting um so if I brought in I NRI um I can forget all about gaves injured or not um and I'm I'm pretty much covered in defense so if I start with um um you know my um Trent Trent Le and Lewis I've got some cover there I mean and Lewis again it's not to say he'll stay forever but I'm not concerned about it but it doesn't feel like I'm going to go near a Spur Defender anytime soon I understand that I understand that but but but as with you I looked at these numbers it's like that completely defies my expectations from from looking at highlights reading the reports and estimate I thought I'd filtered the in the wrong direction when I was sorting it out that's what I thought the first rdit that's exactly what I was going back to one thing we mentioned before by the way I'm just poting the name I shouldn't do that havit you going back to the who would I I sold havit this week to get Sal and that really was on pain of death I really really didn't feel comfortable selling okay he didn't return um but I think he's he's the magic ingredient um at at Arsenal because okay there'll be a few who don't sell in right now but come game week 12 everybody who plays FPL properly is going to have sack it's completely irrelevant having sacka everyone's going to have him um Gabrielle celba Riya some one of those three people were having defense it's the third player it's the third AR the one who's the differential who's the one who can help you out a wee bit and and when I had him since the wild card then I was amazed how lowly owned he was compared to how good is numbers were um and him I would really like to find a way to get back and that's also why I keep referring to I want to keep some money try and get some lower priced options to leave me money in game week 12 to bring him in for the plan was forani um uh makes sense let's see how that goes but um but no um yeah habits really really appeals um I don't think he's ever going to perform I think he's always going to slightly underperform his numbers but still when his numbers are that high you know what yeah um and he's that regular a starter then yeah I'm fine with that I mean last week or the last time we had a video that um Andrew was on he'd done this amazing analysis on on Kai on Kai havitz and sort of looking before and after the erard injury and it was really interesting to me like he pulled that I'm glad you saw that as well because it wasn't information I've been privy to before and and it was like actually this guy's just a great FPL asset with or without um erard doesn't seem to make make an option make a difference rather so ahead of those fixtures that you mentioned Craig it's worth bearing that in mind guys to to plan to look to accommodate him in your front three speaking of front three let's make move on we finally got around to the earling Harland section of the video so let's take a look at how earling harland's numbers have fallen off a cliff okay so I'm expecting that pretty much everyone watching this video probably everyone watching this video actually owns earling Harland um and everyone is pissed off with what they are seeing from this geiza game weeks one through five couldn't have been more happy right and then game weeks six through eight look at those numbers drop off and look at our at average acing excuse me average attacking radar per 90 minutes on the right hand side it's Dreadful isn't it Craig it's rodri is out kdb is out foden's not being picked this gee is useless isn't he what's the crack here dare we sell him ahead of a home game against Southampton done I I'm not selling him this week um but it isn't to say well let's see um my plan is to sell them in nine um I don't see a home game against Southampton as a particularly useful barometer of how well City you're playing I mean this is the one I have spent a bit of time watching more than the others and I'm just not in the least bit um impressed right now it's not to say it could all click one day and he could score four goals again and of course he could definitely and there we go it's always the risk but but the problem is that these numbers um uh as damning as they are that I I don't find them particularly damning of of Harland I find them damning of the way the city you're playing yeah yeah because the whole team has built around that give him the chances and you put them away but they're just not being in any way shape or form creative or or managing to break down or get the ball through to him in any interesting positions um it's not that he's shanking the all into rosed you know it's um he's just not getting the chances that he was before and and please don't ask me to put my finger one the hous and the wires it doesn't matter right to football brain but it's just to my eye you know it's just not even close to working right now some I'm not saying something's completely wrong in the kind of Manchester United Way of something being rot to the core but it's um something's it's not a question of not clicking it's just not at all working right now and I I can't quite maybe kdb comes back this week and maybe that changes it all together but um possibly just I find other things just Biz like like you were saying yourself that foden didn't come back into a team which is struggling for creativity really um I can't quite get my head around it and he's too expensive to drag yeah um so he's got one week against Southampton um and then and then as a plan goes he's toast and I spread the money around scenario as long as I have that minus for yeah let's do some scenario planning then Craig let's say he he does impress let's say it's a it's a Kevin De bruyne back into the team and it's a brace minimum right for for for Harland you you retain him at that point ahead after game week nine or is he is he going to be your mechanism to get to mosalah irrespective of how this kind of free hit against Southampton at home goes in in game week nine yeah it's a fair question difficult yeah it is I mean I'd be more interested in seeing how did they play but again I mean I I don't know how how Martin's goingon to line them up Southampton against City I'm not expecting a great deal but but if City really were to impress you know how much weight could you really put upon it is is my point it's more the fact the last three games they stank yeah um from a creative point of view and and and working the ball through to him so I feel reasonably comfortable going there not least of which because the fixtures are just better um so 10 I would have Salah as my captain uh he would be the standout captain that week 11 I would have son that would be my standout captain that week 12 it will be Sal Palmer um you know it's a while until alland becomes that kind of two expected points per game stand out more than the other players so I think I can I feel like I feel like I can I can take the chance and spread that money it's a fair point I mean it could easily be I'm you know drenched and sweat on the Saturday morning of game week 10 uh my finger wavering over the the mouse key not quite sure whether to do it but but right now it feels like it's it's the right time to jump off it does right yeah like you say that putting aside the why if you're just looking at the what here is how can you jus this amount of investment on someone with these numbers it it feels like feels like a tough tough ask when the others are performing yeah exactly when there are VI very viable options with prolonged FPL pedigree that you can yeah you know you can rely upon interesting mate cool that's been that's been fascinating I think it's been interesting to look at actually seeing how Stark this drop off is in relation to his performance going me one through five after and and the period That's followed 6 through 6 through 8 all right mate let's um let's just wrap this up we've gone um we've gone over 40 minutes so I do just want to to say though transfer plans gun your head you had to make them tonight what are we doing ahead of game

looking back to gw eight so without further ado guys lets get right into it guys welcome back to the channel im craig great to have you back on mate its been ages hows your hows your season working out my friend its going very well tom thanks for having me back on its been a while it was it was preseason when i was last gone i think it was just before game week one if i recall correctly wow okay because i seem to recall saying that i was i was looking ahead to triple captaining harland in game week two and i did it and everything was going great at that point so and its its going to wee bit downhill since but still pretty decent score i think so im happy with the season so far definitely you can see that mak swimming a right around that 140 odd k mark at this stage of the season is strong position so looking back in that case g cr because weve not had you on is there anything thats happened in the first eight game we period which has surprised you and has gone against what you were expecting how it went the crewing of transfers is new how are you finding how the seasons panning out is it a is it a crapshoot is it going as you expected how would you sum things up right lets start with the last one its not going as expected not at all i dont feel like ive got a whole lot right i think ive got two things right since start of the season which im pretty happy with apart from that everythings been a bit of a crapshoot as you call it so i started with i started with salah and harand at the start and that worked out great for the first three weeks i triple captained harland in two game so that works out well im super happy with that but since then well i havent done a lot since then because up until last week had accumulated excuse me four fre transfers wild carded in six but rolled over a few transfers and they were starting to burn a hole in my pocket so last week i spent a few not very wisely as it turns out and ive ive been struggling string to get my head around the new value of a free transfer struggling to get my head around it feels to me im not the huge stats guy but it feels to me this year that the stats are know that theyre so heavily weighted on last years performance and this years performances are quite different it seems particularly from certain individuals so its im finding im stumbling a we bit the scores fine im doing okay dont get me wrong but it doesnt feel like im completely in control a we bit like a co right now so i get it thats it well summed up and i think a lot of managers are find are feeling the same way as well not just the guys who have had on with the theark and andrew cory etc but more widely people are still say still working our way through this arent were only eight game weeks in but score wise is looking is looking super impressive craig so thats something to be holding on to i reckon we should take a look craig how your game week 8 played out you mentioned you had bunch of free transfers going into game week 8 so lets take a look at how you used them and how many points you manag to pick up okay mate so were going to do this piece by piece were going to start with a goalkeeper reveal here which i know the scores cuz preparing for this as a nice way to start isnt it mate mr saling go there the nottingham forest goalkeeper nice cheap option with an 11o hall got to be super happy with how thats working im ridiculously happy i was one of those who got i think many did stumbled on that wild card saturday morning with the is rare fit is rare not fit and and i seem to think you and i have talked about this chat before but i was wise enough to bring in edison again his name does seem to follow you around ha fantasy asset but there we gos hes like hes like the bar of soap in a prison film you exactly whats going to happen when you bend down and pick it up and yet you keep on doing it so at least i do so quite an analogy excuse me so its i took the chance to move him out this week im not at all wow beautiful not at all blown away by well nobody is by city this season particularly not defensively they always have always have had a goal against in them despite incredibly low xgc numbers and i just had enough its just such a drag owning him and and i needed some money from somewhere so sals came in for him and delivered i think more points in one week than edison so that was great its great and a shout out for the forest defense collectively right craig you and i have talked ive certainly talked to mark as well and they were appearing at posit postively as a team defensive unit at the back end of last season thats continued right into the start of the season so they look they look viable lets take a look at the rest of the defense and how theyre looking up so you got trent alexander arnold there gabrielle g premium teams there cra we can look at the bench there as well mikeno and gree respectively as they how are you feeling about that defensive contingent ongoing with some serious investment there with trent and gabrielle whats your whats your thoughts on your defensive setup so far i think trent i still feel that hes a gift and thats what i felt at the start of the season i think the price is still too low theyve got a few fixes coming up which are a bit funky so maybe hes not going to be getting a clean sheet and an assist and three bonus points but but hes had a few of those and im going to do whatever i can to keep him going forwards interesting okay i dont think there were too many premium defenders who were delivering right now or any defenders would living right now apart from forest perhaps so hes he stays for now im happy with him gabrielle were going to get the transfer plans during the chat so hes on thin ice short term at least lewis goes back to the point about edison i dont feel when im watching them all im looking at the numbers afterwards that theyre a particularly safe bet these days were clean sheet but the attraction of lewis is one hes hes dirt cheap or he was at le dirt cheap when i bought him and secondly he does have that attacking potential on his locker okay this week it was it was gradi who chipped in but another week it could quite easily be lewis so im for that price im happy to go with him over another 45 so makes sense i dont see him as a premium defender i see him as a 45 hes got that added bonus of one of these days city will smash somebody 5 nil and he might be tipping in with a few attacking points so thats for me hes just i like it and option and mikeno on the bench there returning from injury in game week eight after that missing out previously and theyve i think im beaten in four now as well so it looks like a nice route into an an improving everton defense would we go that far or do we still not trust them just yet absolutely no i dont trust them as much as others but i do trust them put this way the form they had at the start of the season was not representative of what youre gna get from going forward so whether theyre the best defense no probably not but i think at that price we probably all bought him at which was 43 well what do you want its fine hes going to deliver some weeks some weeks not here cool lets look on to the midfield then mate so were looking here at mumo foden rogers and seeno who was massively stats padding wasnt in terms of everything other than scoring or assisting or gaining any fpl points but everything else he was lighting things up lets talk around this midfield selection sacka missed out because of the the injury that kept him out of the squad all together at bournemouth how you feeling about your midfield five craig lets start with foden lets start lets start with phil okay so i brought foden in this week i got a boner for phil and i wanted to bring him in for these games last week against wolves and this week against who was it this week southampton isnt it this week thats right so that seemed too good to be true and it just didnt factor pep into the equation so i hadnt expected to see him on the bench again this week so thats okay he chipped in with an assist for the jn stones goal fine but it feels a bit of a sucker punch but at the same time i wasnt considering son unlike the cartel and what have you it wasnt an option for me it just it hadnt id looked at johnson i wasnt hot on johnson id looked at madison i was if i was gone for somebody from spurs it would have been madison but i didnt get that far in my process of thought because i much preferred the idea of fen so fen came in which makes total sense for lis diaz i think it was diaz didnt play so that was you would have thought as well craig with de bruyer continued absence as well and well come on and talk at length about harland and the seeming lack of creativity thats massively inut impacting on his output that foden would have been as close to a lock in that guardiola midfield and attack as certainly high sly understand it so ando hes had a cracking start to the season man united havent been impressive have they so you would have been confident with the game at old trafford but one of the few games where they didnt look so impressive what are your feelings about mumo ono and brenford as an attacking option but i think its been a few games now where has at least i havent only seen short highlights so its not an eye test at all but from the numbers side he hasnt been showing any leg there hasnt been a great deal of okay of either expected goals or expected assists for the last few and its got me a little bit worried as it intimated at the start im not trusting all the numbers im seeing at least in terms of the algorithms and fpl review and yours on the on the fantasy football fix site theyre based upon historic data and im seeing i just feel like theres some anomalies between the historic data and the way players are performing right now bourma is one of those top of my list of going forward he should be an absolute lock and i think most people if you havent got him you should why not but at the same time i dont know i dont have any confidence about cant quite tell you why its just a gut feeling but and its at that price point craig isnt it where there are always going to be compelling options week to week in that i dont know what wed call it mid to uper mid price bracket theres always someone of interest it seems game week to game week so its quite easy to get itchy feet isnt it with players like that it is it is but i know i just i made these three moves this week and that was easy because i had four frees but the ones you want to be moving around at least the ones i want to be m moving around ideally the big hitting guys okay i dont mind using transfers on the son well i didnt but the sons the sackers the salas the fodes and so on but i dont i dont see him b in that bracket so i dont want to use transfers on that a menu or b kind player you want to just pick them and leave them there but its only two weeks since i wild carded but ive got to okay to watch itch to be scratched all right well were going to come on a look at game week n in a moment so well talk around transfer plans then but in terms of your more budget enabling and well talk around the sacka plan as well in the game week n slide as well craig so well leave him for now but rogers ne return villa looked good impressive a away win at fulham and se menu as i say lit things up other than from returning fpl points pretty comfortable with those two budget options craig they feel like the popular duo certainly rogers im struggling to think of anybody whos better value at that price on my wild card i there was a there was a few hours there where i was looking at calo from from brenford but i feel reasonably happy with that choice of rogers and i needed i think most people doing i need needed a cheap i call him seventh or eight or fourth or fifth midfielder and he i cant see anybody better im not saying hes gonna turn into a 150 point guy this season none at all but it seems its a gift i like him i like how he plays man its its fun to watch him its fun to see an attacker dribbling and taking people on and willing to shoot and stuff its a bit of a throwback to yester year and he seems like a viable fpl option doesnt he especially at that price so i understand that one lets look at these forwards they make so were going to come on and talk at length about harland so i dont think we need to belabor that captaincy blank there but i am interested in your read on dominic salanki in a lot of peoples team spurs have got a handsome run of fixtures havent they and they thrashed a pitiful west ham which its always difficult for me to watch but he didnt impressed right and seemed to be one of the few attacking options in that game who wasnt presenting much of a case whats your read on sank i thought he played okay but just not as an fpl okay and again im seeing the highlights not the full game but from what i saw he seem to work well with the team he put others into play which is fantastic just from an fpl point of view its just like stop passing the bloody ball so and he was a little bit like that the week before he was better but theres been a few of those games right that this season where he seemed like this foil at the top of the of the formation for bringing the others in which is which is fine and maybe i should have given that more thought before i brought him in this week because im im already regretting it they have a nice game week 11 but thats still a few weeks away mh but that feels that one feels like a mistake foden when on the pitch is always going to be dangerous s lank i cant quite say the same just after one week of being another so im feeling a little bit of buyers regret there know and i should qualify that thought we played well as well its was just fpl relevant in terms of what you want to see there in terms of shot volume and metrics like that lets talk around dcl we mentioned everton improving four i think its four unbeaten now in the league and he remains there forward doesnt he but whats going on with this guy craig whats whats whats your take on him he great value in theory is it is it to stay the course with him because of his price whats your whats your take i think i think unless you have transfers to burn ive got i would doubt you got transfers to burn with g 12 coming thick and fast by which i me to say a fixture screen fix sc then im a little bit sorry to say im stuck with the useless bastard it doesnt feel like ive made the right choice there i think he felt like the right choice at the time but he hasnt posted any decent numbers or any eyecatching performances or he hasnt looked like it doesnt like seena where at least you think well one of those could maybe have gone in the video is so little from calvin lean but it feels a wee bit like im stuck with him for a while anyway but as long as i can restructure that he becomes my first sub and not a player im depending on in the first then okay fine move and me thats a good segue craig so i think with that in mind lets take a look at how your bus team is shaping up ahead of game week nine okay so you alluded to it there cra lets get straight into the bench here so youve decided here we want to talk around what your plans are with sacka injury news pending but the idea to bench calv leen and moleno for a home game against fulham stood out to me here craig because i think theyve theyve we just talked around them looking slightly more encouraging is it just the fact that the rest of your team is strong enough to warrant that or do you just say everton are not a team we should be trusting from an fpl perspective at the moment lets look at the defense lets look at the start with the defense first of all weve got trent and hes going nowhere course that for me is a its got z zero wr all over it and and even if it wasnt i would i wouldnt bench trent theres lewis home to southampton assuming he plays and then theres gabrielle who may or may not be in my team come saturday morning so it might be let not im not sure what we get into plans but who person you got two free trans right so it could well be saka certainly could be sacka at toa but i havent got money so i need a i need a i need a make weight and gabrielle could be the one will probably be the one it would be ideal if it was calv but i havent got the money to go to himis from fulham and palmer so somebody else has to make way so its going to be well who it be theres four candidates its gna be gabrielle seo solank or u and im tempted to go for g ill lose a few quid on gabrielle by selling him but i dont mind feels like an interesting time sorry so no i think ill probably go for gabrielle to probably a nri okay who i would bench this week and then put michel eno in and then i nri comes and starts delivering the points from game week 10 when their fixure round starts going fantastic i like it i like the player as well like nori and wolves theyre hard done by again werent they depending on how you look at it in the man tit game but i like him as an fpl option interesting so interesting that were talking about moving away from arsenal as a as a double move then with these they got three rough fixtures now right with over the next over the next three and off the back of a defeat against against bournemouth do we think that strategically is what youd be recommending like arsenal are a bit of a swerve for now no i wouldnt recommend it in so far as its just where im at right now and it goes hand inand with some of the other priorities ive got for the next few weeks which were going to get onto but no i still think arsenal if you look at the numbers and its all completely skewed because theyve had three red cards i still think their hands down the best defense in the league okay so theres nothing to say that they couldnt get three clean sheets or three decent results in the next few games its just much more unlikely than its likely but from game week 12 were all going to want them back two probably three moving on toward christmas so its just a temporary switching around so sacka will leave this week for palmer for the very simple reason that im quite terrified of not having pal im not going to try and give you some stats or any sophisticated well well come on to some in a minute right when well see well see his name up in light wont we yeahh and then gabrielle will come back in 12 along with saka i say gabrielle it could also be i forgotten his name the left bank italian guy me too i know who you mean the new signing i know who you mean c well remembered so an arsenal defensive becomes viable from 12 i get it so its just moving things around right now to chase some of the players whove got the big weeks coming up so thats timer could be any week thats the fear game week 10 is s and trent thats their time to shine game week 11 weve got son and drum rolls aany and then 12 well its wide open then its just arsenal and chelsea all the to christmas just city games thrown in craig did you have any thoughts on you mentioned salah there as well i thought another very impressive performance they just they just take them as red now and salad gives these performances its been for so long from an fpl perspective have you got any designs on trying to squeeze him back into the team even if it would be a part of a hit or how does no yes absolutely absolutely whats the plan then lets talk around the mo the mosala plan for you well okay you cant have them all no weve been saying this since start of the season theyve priced it absolutely fantastically this season here i think me too so im not moving trent i want saka i want palmer if i want salah then someones gonna have to give i see i think we all know who it is so okay so its just a question of and the only thing im trying to make i have got so far down to planning out on my posted notes like i normally do but ive got a rough idea in my head that who will go and come in which order and as long as ive got a route like as long as ive got a minus four back to harland if salah breaks his knee and then har scores a hatrick he like my god as long as i can just with one move or two moves with a minus four get harlem back the next week fine im happy to take that risk thats where i feel right now because city just dont im not im not seeing it when im watching them i dont see a cohesive unit i dont see its like whats that cartoon is it what do you call that in english is it find wally or wheres w where w its like its like the easiest game in the world for man city wheres harland like hes just stood there doing nothing waiting for someone to pass him the ball this is a spoiler for us which they cant seem to work out how to do but its just final thing on the transer plans ahead of game week n you got the two were expecting palmer to come in for sacka and theyre being a make quate cory in the slack channel was making the point as to gabrielle having a a bit of goal threat there is there any thought you mentioned not being enamored by salanki to do something with him to make funds and if so what would that move double move look like craig its funny you mention that because i think in all honesty its like what is it from pp fixtion thats just pride with you ive just brought salanki in and i feel like a bit of a mug if i take him out this the week after but youre probably right that in all honesty looking ahead for where i want to be then it probably saves me a transfer going forward sometime in the next five weeks if i just sell salan now if i sell salanki now i think there would only be two and again its not for a direct replacement its for how muchoney i would need to raise in the weeks ahead so its only two choices it would be gimenez or it would be kuna if shiao pedro was fit i would consider him but im pretty sure he comes in for calv lein as soon as hes fit so kuna or jimenez would be my move for solank which would give me plenty of money in the bank to play around with the other moves i have planned you got a a expectation which way youre leaning which one will be the make weake to enable palmer to come in craig if it was more likely to be gabrielle or solanky which way are you leaning at the minute well it was gabrielle one minute ago but what do you think tom i just thought when you mentioned about the thought the thought youre going to be bringing an arsenal defender back in 12 my financial analyst background to me suggests that you might want to retain someone who youve already got money in so id probably be leaning more towards salanki as the as the option particularly as i love ral gimenez and im super impressed by him as and that is a lovely little segue onto our stats round up for the last four game weeks guys so this is probably my favorite part of the show guys that weve been bringing in for the last few videos and this is just a reminder its looking at the last four game weeks stats are average per game and they need to have played at least 180 minutes over the course of the season so this is what were looking at here and there are some interesting names here arent they greg when we were talking off camera and some stunning revelations in the expected goals conceded from team metric i had to run them twice you asked my boss whether or not id gone crazy because west ham are in there so i like that doesnt feel right but whats leaping out to you here mate youve talked around palmer already the stats seem to be backing that up right hes hes looking like a tremendous fpl asset even with the good pricing that you mentioned as well the for the goals and assists theres no surprises in the goals that well a little bit with solanki given the given the narrative had last four only been paying attention for the last two so thats thats perhaps where it coms on him andz being up and forth him and as appears in different places here he seems hes certainly the purple patch he is so it seems to be the right time to hit on him the other one the other one which jumped out is kudos and okay hes suspended now silly boy but i think most of us would have been looking at west ham assets in a few week time and not right now but every every time i see west ham mention everyones always saying bows the only asset not decrying bo as an fp asset quite the opposite got a huge long pedigree but k his numbers man theyre interesting theyre going to go south in a rush now but hes not going to be on the pitch but but its worth remembering for when he comes back from suspension it is mate and when the pictures pick up hes interested me with these numbers here and he should be right he was he was predicted to do well this season as well i think it was either 15 or 16 goal involvements last season as well hes a terrific player i love watching him play and he does it does translate to fpl points and weve weve seen that over a period now but as you say hes gone and got himself sent off that rules him out of the game against man united in gw nine and out of peoples thinking for this period but a nice shout ahead of fixture change down the line as well for sure someone whos conspicuous by their absence here craig is harland right expected goals we mentioned i mentioned last video with andrew that he was not there but he was appearing in the shots and shots in the box volume so we were bit more relaxed about things it disappeared from there and i took the time to look and he has over the last four game weeks and well come on to look at him in a minute but over the last four his expected goals per 90 is that is the equivalent of leandro martinez of man united center half fame so that tells you where hes at right so were going to get onto harland in detail in a minute but just outside of that there anybody else thats on this screen here thats youre thinking they present an interesting case sacka still super high if he was if he was deemed fit for example would you say theres a case to keep him ahead of your palmer move or is palmer still just i think i think the fixtures theyve got are just too ry too tight to not take a chance on sos son or palmer in those three weeks and so i havent made that much money on him i dont think i was just checking yesterday doesnt like gabrielle got quite a bit tied up but for me thats straight i think that the seeding is so high on the other players at a period where his seeding is going to be relatively lower than what it is then i feel intensely relaxed about moving him out going forwards understood mate so thats not an issue for me there at all youve got me cooking now on this solanky thing i cant get out of my head thats interesting i wasnt expecting to see him in the expected goals there as well so maybe my enthusiasm to ditch him has being offset by that a little bit so its a fair point mud the water has lets just to talk real quickly on the expected goals conceded some funny n team names in there right spurs bourn north west ham villa and fulham respectively impressing over the last four from that particular metric teams there in terms of budget friendly options do you think they represent a route into freeing up those precious funds craig any team that you think they fpl options id be interested in two of them but funnily enough not the first three okay so villa and fulham have been a little bit on my radar in terms of this money finding exercise im going through in the weeks ahead v i still think con he didnt play this weekend which is a bit cheeky because i think emory gave the indication that he would play but whatever i think coner i had him from the start of the season i still think hes the standout choice from their defense m fulham i had robinson from the start and i seem to think he picked up one return in the second week his numbers are but his numbers his attacking numbers are poor i know his heat map looks like a thing of thing of beauty but his his end product is poor so i think i know corys got the hot room is yin anderson fulham whos unless hes gone up in price he was 43 earlier in the week so that seems if if robinson is all fart and no poop then i think he may as well just save the money and go for anderson like who can also be a set piece to so those two are the ones i would go for from those two west ham fixtures nah im not going there for now but more than happy to look at them 13 14 onwards spurs i was found that peculiar to find them there as well pedro is the name that leaps out from when weve talked historically about them but pay a bit more for him what you read on tottenham as fpl defensive options im absolutely gob smacked to see them at the top of this list absolutely blown away parro i dont find to be anywhere near as interesting an option as he was last season even though i didnt own him that much last season hes offset pieces hes getting forward but not in the same way as he was last season and they look more fragile to my know more fragile but they still look fragile they still like theyve got a crazy capitulation in them i didnt see the game but i listened to the brion game that famous second i had that on i was back in the uk for the first time in a while so i had that in five live on a long drive down from scotland and and that was quite that was quite entertaining listening to it being described in audio bad i think theyve its always my gut feeling and its not fair its not statistically based its emotionally based but i always feel theyve got that stupid banana peel slip up in them so im im looking at that 102 and shaking my head and im im not tempted to go there and if i was it wouldnt be it wouldnt be p would be probably one of the two center backs van some like that romero so but im not its going back to my plans if i dont michel leno they still have and okay theyre not on that table im curious if theyre six but theyre not on the table but their fixtures are solid going forward and they rotate well with with wolves interesting so if i brought in i nri i can forget all about gaves injured or not and im im pretty much covered in defense so if i start with my trent le and lewis ive got some cover there and lewis again its not to say hell stay forever but im not concerned about it but it doesnt feel like im going to go near a spur defender anytime soon i understand that i understand that but as with you i looked at these numbers its like that completely defies my expectations from looking at highlights reading the reports and estimate i thought id filtered the in the wrong direction when i was sorting it out thats what i thought the first rdit thats exactly what i was going back to one thing we mentioned before by the way im just poting the name i shouldnt do that havit you going back to the who would i sold havit this week to get sal and that was on pain of death i didnt feel comfortable selling okay he didnt return but i think hes hes the magic ingredient at arsenal because okay therell be a few who dont sell in right now but come game week 12 everybody who plays fpl properly is going to have sack its completely irrelevant having sacka everyones going to have him gabrielle celba riya some one of those three people were having defense its the third player its the third ar the one whos the differential whos the one who can help you out a wee bit and when i had him since the wild card then i was amazed how lowly owned he was compared to how good is numbers were and him i would like to find a way to get back and thats also why i keep referring to i want to keep some money try and get some lower priced options to leave me money in game week 12 to bring him in for the plan was forani makes sense lets see how that goes but but no habits appeals i dont think hes ever going to perform i think hes always going to slightly underperform his numbers but still when his numbers are that high what and hes that regular a starter then im fine with that last week or the last time we had a video that andrew was on hed done this amazing analysis on kai on kai havitz and looking before and after the erard injury and it was interesting to me like he pulled that im glad you saw that as well because it wasnt information ive been privy to before and it was like this guys just a great fpl asset with or without erard doesnt seem to make an option make a difference rather so ahead of those fixtures that you mentioned craig its worth bearing that in mind guys to plan to look to accommodate him in your front three speaking of front three lets make move on we finally got around to the earling harland section of the video so lets take a look at how earling harlands numbers have fallen off a cliff okay so im expecting that pretty much everyone watching this video probably everyone watching this video owns earling harland and everyone is pissed off with what they are seeing from this geiza game weeks one through five couldnt have been more happy right and then game weeks six through eight look at those numbers drop off and look at our at average acing excuse me average attacking radar per 90 minutes on the right hand side its dreadful isnt it craig its rodri is out kdb is out fodens not being picked this gee is useless isnt he whats the crack here dare we sell him ahead of a home game against southampton done im not selling him this week but it isnt to say well lets see my plan is to sell them in nine i dont see a home game against southampton as a particularly useful barometer of how well city youre playing this is the one i have spent a bit of time watching more than the others and im just not in the least bit impressed right now its not to say it could all click one day and he could score four goals again and of course he could definitely and there we go its always the risk but the problem is that these numbers as damning as they are that i dont find them particularly damning of harland i find them damning of the way the city youre playing because the whole team has built around that give him the chances and you put them away but theyre just not being in any way shape or form creative or managing to break down or get the ball through to him in any interesting positions its not that hes shanking the all into rosed its hes just not getting the chances that he was before and please dont ask me to put my finger one the hous and the wires it doesnt matter right to football brain but its just to my eye its just not even close to working right now some im not saying somethings completely wrong in the man utd way of something being rot to the core but its somethings its not a question of not clicking its just not at all working right now and i cant quite maybe kdb comes back this week and maybe that changes it all together but possibly just i find other things just biz like you were saying yourself that foden didnt come back into a team which is struggling for creativity i cant quite get my head around it and hes too expensive to drag so hes got one week against southampton and then and then as a plan goes hes toast and i spread the money around scenario as long as i have that minus for lets do some scenario planning then craig lets say he does impress lets say its a its a kevin de bruyne back into the team and its a brace minimum right for harland you retain him at that point ahead after game week nine or is he is he going to be your mechanism to get to mosalah irrespective of how this free hit against southampton at home goes in game week nine its a fair question difficult it is id be more interested in seeing how did they play but again i dont know how martins goingon to line them up southampton against city im not expecting a great deal but if city were to impress how much weight could you put upon it is my point its more the fact the last three games they stank from a creative point of view and working the ball through to him so i feel reasonably comfortable going there not least of which because the fixtures are just better so 10 i would have salah as my captain he would be the standout captain that week 11 i would have son that would be my standout captain that week 12 it will be sal palmer its a while until alland becomes that two expected points per game stand out more than the other players so i think i can i feel like i feel like i can i can take the chance and spread that money its a fair point it could easily be im drenched and sweat on the saturday morning of game week 10 my finger wavering over the mouse key not quite sure whether to do it but right now it feels like its its the right time to jump off it does right like you say that putting aside the why if youre just looking at the what here is how can you jus this amount of investment on someone with these numbers it feels like feels like a tough ask when the others are performing exactly when there are vi very viable options with prolonged fpl pedigree that you can you can rely upon interesting mate cool thats

4,AboveAverageFPL,QkRZCwTdSqs,GW9 Team Selection | TRIPLE CAPTAIN HAALAND? | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-10-24T21:09:47Z,[Music] n [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always joined by Baker evening mate how you doing not too bad mate not too bad not too bad Thursday night Friday deadline not long to go I like Friday deadlines it just feels like you can finish work get your team done and then you can just yeah you're just out you're just out of it sday morning just so irritating and they like like the 12:30 stuff you just feel like you feel like you're just constantly thinking about it from about 9 to about 11:00 what's going on what's going to happen I like it no control deadline's done relax yeah it's weird one though for me actually because on a on a Saturday morning normally I'm taking the little one to to dancing and so then I get half an hour to myself while she's there sitting in the car so I can flick onto a stream I can search Twitter I can jump on Discord chat with the patrons I can do all that stuff um in that half hour and be kind of just ready to go I give her a lift to gymnastics we turn up at about 5 to 11 and then it's like right I got five more minutes she runs off and it's like okay I can get any moves that I need to do done so I don't mind it I don't mind it personally but yeah no I can get the appeal I can get the appeal of a of a Friday deadline for sure there's not even a l lunch time kickoff is it Saturday I have no idea mate I have no idea so Switched Off yeah so it's Lester Forest leester Forest tomorrow night yeah 8:00 and then next game is straight into it 3:00 yeah loads of them well four of them not loads this the time yeah I mean I'm maybe I'm just not paying attention so much because I'm not thinking I'm going to do much this week yeah spoiler spoiler alert yeah I just don't think I just don't think I'm going to be doing doing loads um Spurs are on at the moment yep so we've timed this perfectly as always timed it perfectly brenon Johnson's coming on for the second half just FYI couple of people in the Stream said it was lagging a little bit but uh a few hours have refreshed and it seems like it's okay okay good doesn't look like it's lagging on my side no drop frames nothing like that so hopefully yeah we should be okay so just refresh your stream if you're if it is doing that and hopefully we should be just good um so hello to to everyone in the YouTube chat and uh yeah there is a poll out I mean it is the question of of the week do you want to be triple captain in Harland uh yes no or let us know if you've played it already let us know in the comments um let's see what you're going to be doing and yeah I mean I can imagine so did you see earlier on when when Andy sent out a message sent out a tweet he was like I'm thinking about doing this thinking about doing this and just was talking about transfers and he' already changed his triple Captain was active on on harand just sitting there in the image first 20 comments no one noticed really yeah first 20 comments no one noticed and um and then somebody somebody down bit further down picked it up I said I see that little white chip there I see it there sneaking in so you know if you want a if you want a a yard stick on on whether we're going to be hitting 200% EO like Andy MIRS let's talk FPL if he's got it on it's going to be high yeah it's going to be high I think it's it's going to be uh do I think it'll be 230 240 something like that no I don't think it will be I think it'll be like 210 maybe um and that is quite interesting isn't it because obviously quite a lot of people have played it already Okay quite a lot quite a lot of people are going to play it yeah normally normally you don't really get this kind of like some did it here some did it here some did it there like last season virtually everyone did it in the same place see someone I was chatting I was half chatting to someone um on X last week I can't remember when I played mine I can't remember we played it game we 27 was it hland everyone did that game 27 hland I can't remember genuinely gen I can't remember but everyone did it like we literally remember the end of the season thing we did the sort analysis looked at all the different places to see you know who um when did people play and everyone played in the same place yeah okay yeah that's true that's true a couple more people are saying that they're having problems with the stream um I am not sure why that is to be honest because as I say I've got this little thing that says dropped frames normally when the when the it lags and even crypto block Dan saying it as well and he has the best internet in the world so this is very interesting let's see if I can let's see if I can press a few buttons if you lose you I apologize but uh oh I don't like it when you press a few buttons man I don't know I don't know what else I'm supposed to do mate to be honest um let's see if we can f b justor did you do that did you press the button to make fan of B score no but that's not a bad thing is it there's enough people say work it's fine I think we just I think we just uh we just crack on we just crack on yeah okay well um if you are managing to see the screen and you are enjoying the content that we do make sure you drop a like on on the video um bergell has just missed from two yards and taking the keeper out and uh if you like uh if you want to see more then make sure you subscribe and um yeah thanks to everyone in the chat for joining us and we can I guess we can just go straight into the games let's go straight in the games mate let's get it done straight in the games we got to be short because obviously it's Friday deadline so we're limited time frames here so we are lot let's do it do it get out cool so standard graphic Rob T just showing us the expected goals and percentage probability chances of clean sheets uh no surprises City stick out as the prime fixture in fact uh we we you know we're normally looking as you say before previously teams are looking to score over two goals and it's pretty much you know there are a couple there but it's basically City or bust feels like uh a city or bust week um 3.35 expected goals with a 50% chance of a clean sheet and um and Southampton with the only team that's expected to score less than one goal or not expected to score a goal slam D fixture absolutely it's a slam D picture is is what it is I think you know brenford and Brighton both on 2xg or more you know we ask are we starting to see are we starting to see three or four teams that we can look at every week when we're looking at looking at um picking teams to Target like yeah very much historically it's been it's been big four plus or big six like that's where you that's where you see it you know the big big attacks but well we've seen Brighton up there before we've seen Brighton up there before definitely under desery a few times and uh but Brighton with no Striker really no it's surprising that is a little bit surprising well Beck's definitely not making it and obviously J Pedro not either don't know about Ferguson after um coming off early last week it's I'm surprised I'm surprised about it and I don't think you know it's rare that you'll go into a week where you'll have um a team where that's got virtually no ownership in terms of the attack and they've got an expected goals of 2.15 in a week yeah um georgino 5.5 you know he's is an interesting pick now on on if you were on wild cart this week I think I think he genuinely is quite interesting um probably hard to trust many of the others in in in that but is he interesting enough that you'd pick him say over Rogers continues to liver Villa got 1.85 expected goals you probably have him would you have georginio over mcneel yeah probably not probably not because the like the guarantee of minutes the guarantee of involvement set pieces at space I'd still think I'd like McNeil probably over georgino um yeah I I think I think it's a tough one Brighton looking at this one is it makes you sort of sway towards could I get anything there but just I just don't see they're about to walk into Liverpool and City I mean I I think it's a it's it's a complete non-discussion with Everton who like Fulham Southampton West Ham brenford compared to wolves Leicester sorry wolves Liverpool City I just think I just think those three fixtures those next two fixtures if it was on wild card I would just be I would be swerving Brighton because just unless unless you've unless you've got transfers in the bank like if you got three or four transfers and you're on a wild card then cool yeah go for a punt and use one to get out of it um and you might go you might just go from one team to the other you just go from from a Brighton to a to a wolves maybe although there aren't any real midfielders from wolves that you want to be fair you know a lot of people with at Nori now very popular this week and um and like he's going in as a Defender against a team that were expected two goals against you wouldn't normally play Defenders against a team that's expected two goals against so yeah he's a stash really and he yeah yeah definitely definitely um are you are you looking up because rardon has scored uh I didn't know he scored he's just about to take the penalty but thanks ah that was a penalty was it yeah he just staring down I've got notification I'm not watching it I got notification yeah yeah yeah he's staring it down um yeah JC's brought up an interesting an interesting point and actually we will discuss that later on we have got a we have got a graphic for for um for a free Hit N team because it is you know is an option particularly if you've got you if you're low on Brighton I mean the difficulty is as we've said with Brighton is is that they don't have any Strikers so that you know you could go I guess you could go Boma um georgino and then what 30y at the back I think yeah I think so we'll look at that free hit in a minute but I think I'll put Rogers in in on that free hit team and I think bear in mind giorgino's probably got pens as well this weekend yeah yeah I'll probably go georgino over over Rogers but then again I told you last week to go e over Rogers and and watch the scores so so that's that's the difficulty when it's a it's a relatively good game for them this um I think you know is is people will be looking at Watkins and potentially again still thinking do I sell him do I do you know because of the other Shiny Toys you might want to get the foden the Palmer all those type of players but 1.85 has a massive share of the goals Watkins is still fantastic in my opinion this week um brenford if if you after cheap Striker this week so like Chris Wood we have a chance to talk about Chris Wood cuz he scored Monday night yeah you could obviously look at it and say whis's back good fixtures long good fixtures we don't know we don't know he's back back though right he's at a half hour which is fine but you know we're not talking about a a son Palmer saaka type job where you where you take you take the risk because you know how important they are to the team and you know that they can have an immediate impact because of the individual quality of the player now I'm not saying whis is not a good player I think he's a good player but he's not a great player no that said you know I think say I I use the pun for you I think brenford will Farm big chances they literally will against the old tractor boys and so you know he's going to be he's going to be one that's going to be a huge beneficiary of that obviously bumo as well um it was weird I had a discussion with someone on on X earlier they just sent me a little DM asking me a few like questions which nobody ever does so I was like well okay and he was like would you sell DCL for wha and I actually said no on that one just because I think that I just think that Everton will continue to you know generate good chances over the next three or four weeks and um I just think that transfer might be better used Elsewhere on a pivot and gameweek 12 type Vibe so you know again one week punt maybe well one week punt definitely I mean if you're on free hit yeah I would have him but I don't think I I think I'd be comfortable enough just having bumo in that fixture yeah I just think but just go back to these cheap Strikers I think we've all danced around chriswood most of us have not everyone because more than 10% of the game had him the other night when he scored yeah like it's a long time now I think they pulled up pulled up um like last 38 games or something like that yeah last 38 games like literally a calendar season as it were and only Palmer and Harlem more goals in him yeah which is insane what are we mocking about like why why isn't isn't wood just set and forget leave him there thanks very much I agree is this the right it sounds like it should be the right entry point but is is a is a way Derby the right entry point I don't probably not like we we're all going to keep saying is it worth it but it's probably just just some Reflections for us you know is is is like when it came to Wild Card you went and ker I went DCL we were looking looking looking for stuff when the thing that we continually talk about is Nuno loves him yeah yeah where we've had this bit where we were like we're not sure if we love him and maybe we like Taio better and all this sort of stuff but the fact is the manager absolutely loves him hasn't stopped picking him up for for a year he's just he's just a really good I've been I've been hot on him since 2019 mate and I still can't pick I've don't think I've ever still can't pick him it's really stupid it's it doesn't it doesn't make a huge even when he was at Burnley I was like yeah I'll go Ashley Barnes over him and and things like that it's it's weird like like when the opportunity is there I think is is at some point is we'll make that move um the entry point as I say we talk about entry point like if you don't get this fixture like you want probably four fixtures to be honest you want four or five fixtures out of it and and if you lose the promoted side one it's like well it's just a little bit worse now because instead of the next five to West Ham we just saw what West Ham did I know I'm just thinking like instead of being in instead of being Leicester as the entry point and the next five fixtures ending in IPS your entry point is West Ham and it ends with City and you're like well that's stupid isn't it yeah yeah and then doesn't make sense doesn't make sense it's it's now it's now or it's actually never but what we'll do is we'll go oh yeah we're not going to do it then because then he's got like a way to Arsenal but then he's home to I switch I don't think I can get to him anyway I I don't think I can reasonably get to him without without a hit that's the thing if I could move xia Pedro to him I would just do it we'll always find reasons we'll always find reasons to him um but yeah just some positive positives for him other than that this week obviously Spurs good fixture all looks of things 1.9 um I think it's really interesting how The Bookies have are now seeing Arsenal Liverpool if you looked at last year a Klo game in this one like 2.8 expected goals between the two teams is low you know you you virtually got the same expected goals in Everton Fulham as you do in Arsenal Liverpool yeah that's quite interesting yeah there's only there's literally only Leicester forest and Everton Fulham they have have lower expected goals than arsal Liverpool this weekend yeah I mean yeah I mean that's going to be down to that's as you say like it's not a it's a Klo thing I guess um obviously they're a lot more conser not conservative they a lot more controlled in buildup aren't they Liverpool and they haven't and they haven't been they aren't going to put I mean they're not going to do it to Arsenal but they aren't they don't look like they're going to score three or four goals in a game um well they look like it Liverpool looked like if they went two and0 up they just wouldn't let they just they just shut up shot completely yeah yeah yeah completely yeah I mean I I think I think it's I think it's still a good fixture for the Defenders I really do like it's it's not a disastrous fixture feels Ki I wouldn't be surprised if it walked away a n n you'd also wouldn't be surprised if it finished one all or 21 either so so it's not it's not probably it's not probably a 20o um game for the Defenders either no but you know saying that is Gabrielle got the 15p pointer against Tottenham yeah like those set pieces set pieces could be really big for Tren and gab yeah it's um it's just a just a toughy one um we weren't really planning on talking about Tottenham but uh I'm going to blame that that Dom in the chat said is Will Will Madison play um well he's um looking around now I don't think he's on the pitch now I think he it's very interesting that he started tonight and obviously not saw yeah that that was something I wasn't well I didn't know how much Andrew was going to rotate tonight I know obviously we had the we we obviously know about son I don't think there's any worries about son whatsoever um you know not in plans for the game and sess that doesn't doesn't scream like there's an issue just screams like I'm just managing minutes but it does look like he's been taken off at half time unless um no no Teo went off at half time Madison Madison on the pitch and N other moves made so far 60 Minutes in yeah so yeah I think that's a worry for Madison I think that is a worry you know is is they obviously they quite often will play three in the middle you know and and all that stuff and I just I do Wonder um if from that last game the SAR basuma and uh keski Midfield maybe just thinks it's more solid maybe as an away game yeah definitely be i' definitely be a little anxious if I was a Madison owner yeah I mean I I don't know this is this is a home game and you only 45 minutes maybe he just needs to get more minutes in his legs like would we be bothered would we be bothered about him if he'd have played 85 minutes and then played 30 minutes today I don't think i' be he did get taken off at half time for tactical reasons yeah that's but I said I said at the weekend that's specific specific to the way the game was going now if he thinks that we're going to have the same problem against Palace I don't know it it's it's definitely not good though is it oh no there's no there's no way we spin it in this is a good thing no no no no no that's fine um so yeah it's it's it's definitely definitely a problem and obviously if somehow Madison doesn't play then it's good for parro yeah it's great par other ones on this man united look good Chelsea look good look good good we better just look at the main man I suppose then Man City yeah so so we know there's no doku this weekend yeah we know there's no greish this weekend um I think the one thing is that's definitely it's definitely a bump for har of minutes and it's definitely a bump for photom minut it isn't it what choice they got yeah yeah sounds like F and left well the only thing is is I don't know will play fod and left or play left and then um Bernardo right play Bernardo right obviously yesterday second half he played Monas Nunes on the left yeah there is also that and he was good didn't just play on the left he was good on the left um would so wouldn't surprise me if he played all of those he just said there is is is um and you know foden stays Central I think I think he just I think it just it does feel like end of the last season he was just Bin's now Central player and I think I do think that will continue I think the reason why I bought toinho is and his plan doku and all those things is that he just doesn't see Boden as that as that wide man anymore so I do think I do think he'll still play Central but yeah it could be sininho and Bernardo feels like probably what it is and then what kovic and Bernardo in the middle I don't think they're going to need much defensive no defensive uh defensive work doing at the weekend I can imagine that that past map is going to look very interesting yeah yeah I do yeah yeah good for good for V well I think if Nunes is there I'm not sure it is as good I'm not sure it is as good for vardal but hey maybe he doesn't need to because he bangs him in from 20 yards anyway so if he passes to him because if he always goes out on the outside then maybe not yeah maybe not I mean V I'll just find ways of scoring yeah true it is it is it is what it is you know and they have 50 chance for clean like viio should be a really really good pick the question is you do you do you want to spend six million on vardal if you haven't got him yeah a lot of money is it it's a lot of money I do think um so Trent to vario for example I do think just Liverpool are Miles better defensively they're miles better defensively they're incredible defensively I'm not sure I'm not sure I'd save that million quid would you back would you the fixtures I mean I wouldn't back the fixtures though over the next few I I know they get I back this fixture but post this fixture I'd back Liverpool's fixtures they've got Brighton liw Brighton and then they got they got two home yeah both at home they're both at home but it's still Brighton and Villa I I if you ask me Brighton and Villa at home or bourma from Brighton away from Man City if you ask me to take the bet we'll have that bet all day long mate I'll take you any day any day of the week this is Man City one clean sheet since game week one absolutely diabolical defensively two away games I I don't think they're good cleans Liverpool just went out to lipick and and cleaned like they they're cleaning everybody okay they give one chance up really to Liverpool to Chelsea you know AR Arsenal they're away to Arsenal Arsenal expected 1.5 goals like these are these are a really good defense I I I don't I I wouldn't like a Trent to Valar move that's that's for me I think You' have to I just think you'd have to have not side about five transfers in the bank it depends on what you're going to do with a million quid I don't know I don't know how much how much you can improve your sigh with a million quid though in Midfield or attack and that's the point that's why I don't think it's worth it because I don't think you're getting enough bang for your buck with that extra million quid that's why that's why I think if you're going to get off you just you just jump yeah fair enough hence that's what I've done yeah um um captaincy Triple cap to captaincy Harland do you think that's an absolute no-brainer or could you see yourself going elsewhere do you look at the goal projections yeah let's have a look at the Go protections so harand projected 1.36 um I think for reference when he played it switch it was 1.35 so basically the same um yeah Palmer 65 is next so you know um he's expected to score at least one more goal or dble sorry not at least one more goal he's expected to score double of any other player in the league this this week so captaincy a lock triple captaincy an option yeah yeah it is obviously you know obviously he scores ridiculous goal in the mid last night and yeah I mean if we look at the times so this is the third time this season that he's had expected goals or projected goals we to say of more than one against brenford Grace against ipswitch hatrick it effing suggests you're going to get 13 points minimum if you do triple Captain him yeah and it's 13 points it's a clear 13 point points on the field yes that's huge you know I I I expect models will have him somewhere like nines early nines or something like that as a prediction but either way it's going to be a good clean amount of points against the field it's it's a I couldn't put anyone off it that was trying choosing to do it um I'm just goingon to personally you know is I I'm although it's been pretty much a disaster of season so far I don't I still feel like I'd like to hold on to it that's that's just how how I feel with it I think this season more than any season like bonus points reward the attacker yeah I like that if I can have two games if I can have a Talisman in two games and preferably a Midfield Talisman in two games I just think it's it gives me just a fantastic opportunity um from the bonus perspective realistically I don't value the chip that highly anyway like it it's one time this player isn't it yeah yeah that's what it is how many times how many points do you think that player is gonna get in a week and you get that yeah extra that is that is what it is um but yeah definitely would put it on off it for me I'm I'd I just want to hold on to it and if you didn't have Harland you just kept who if you didn't have Harland because there's people don't have Harland that won't be free hitting to get him in I think I prefer the I think I prefer the boomo pick because I think if you haven't got Holland you've definitely got boomo I mean everyone loads of people have got boomo I think that's the fun that's the fun pick this week yeah I I definitely I like um I would go Boomer over Palmer as C to B yeah yeah cool we're in agreement there we're in agreement I do wonder if those odds just seeing this world back currently projected .58 I think once you know bookies maybe realize that he's definitely not playing I wonder how much whether that does have a big old dent in the in the projected goals for for Brighton on that those data we saw yeah true but other than that look Watkins Jackson wood wood still here ahead of son as well wood is ahead of son wood is ahead of salanki wood is ahead of esack yeah and wood is ahead of the striker that's probably going to be playing against IP witch which is yeah yeah I a bit I feel a bit stupid on the wood thing on the thing it is what it is mate it is what it is um JC saying triple Captain Chris Wood maybe that's the way maybe that is the way do you want look at Team yeah let's go look at it okay so I got move Off the Bench now I for who though G Rogers rers okay fair enough um so you'd have wood over whis in this in this week yes said that I know it just said that but I I you just said I don't know he's but I would I know but I would yeah I know I would still take that free hit you want the Friday night game you're free hit you want the Friday night game I'd still take that punt I I would back myself over The Bookies in that sorry K got double defense oh mate just get van no mate these guys are scoring for fun just go full triple Brighton at the back anyway free hit team uh veran in goal p Collins and dunk at the back bumo foden gundan Palmer uh in Midfield Rogers is on screen not for long uh Watkins wood and Harland up top yes Rogers fabianski mikeno and Justin on the bench it's it's it's a good way if you haven't got Harland I wouldn't break my team up to Har I'd free hit this week it's a fun week to do it I I I I still probably would prefer well Ian maybe I'm talking from a position where I've already triple captained I think i' much now that i' I've locked I've locked a chip away um I would probably be looking to to wait for a double for my free hit and so if you didn't free hit would you would you just take the gamble on bumo as opposed to breaking up the team get harded yeah yeah yeah I just Captain him bumo I just Captain bumo um yeah I can't ging anyway on the Harland thing are CU because you're going to get him into captains it but you're not actually gain on it because it give be 200% anyway no you're not going to gain on it but you're not goingon to you're GNA avoid losing on it right yeah you're going to avoid losing you're going to you're going to avoid losing on it people say like you don't gain anything well yes I do I actually gain Harland that's what I get I get I get the Harland points whereas I would have done before but um yeah we have just looked here and said basically getting 13 points so imagine actually is% owner you don't own you're 26 points down on the field oh when when have you ever looked at FPL optimized and been minus 26 and gone I can recover from this like you don't you're just you're week's dead your weak is dead I I would I would would would would um gondo is won for me he's taking set pieces he just is a bully in these kind of games we've seen him do it internationally we've seen him do it for City he just hang around in the Box he just hang around in the box and he just always scores in these games um and he's % owned yeah you would not be I would genuinely not be surprised if he's SC a hat trick this weekend he' be straight in for me over aario because I think you've got a really good opportunity uh I would I still like pinck and Collins because they setpiece threat is so big IPS which you got no Greaves they got no Twan a yeah you just got to go at it just got to go at it I would I that for me it would those are the players I would definitely go for um you can walk around whether it's wood whether it's wi whether it's Rogers whether it's georgino all of those type of ones but I I think it's I think it's great um I was tempted if a couple of people I was looking at this I was tempted with um gacho over Rogers yeah was definitely one I looked at but again there's nothing wrong with Rogers like I know it's good you're going to look at it but technically still Villa expected to score more goals than man united this week they didn't play Thursday night man united are playing Thursday night you know um yeah I like I do like but just like about probably just realizing the Friday night games leer farest I'll probably go I'll probably go would I like Nao for the next five weeks as well like he's a good pick for the next five weeks he was cheap legitim legitimately I was thinking about him this week yeah yeah I still am to be honest agreed um agreed yeah I mean he he hasn't done anything tonight I assume done absolutely nothing tonight don't know but the good thing is about him is obviously last season he got ridden as a 90minut man and the last four games he's played 90 minutes so as soon as ten hog says you're my boy and you're playing again every minute a play time yeah he's I mean he's still on the pitch he's still on the pitch at the moment one shot he's he's got stamina for days J's asking us where's Bruno couldn't afford it couldn't actually afford it because obviously because the Watkins thing you'd have to lose Watkins lose Watkins get Bruno get v no not going to that am I why would you on a fre Walkins home to Bournemouth you could have you could have Bruno you literally have Bruno at home to Southampton and bner already sent off and I'd still have Watkins bought home to Bournemouth over over Bruno yeah okay I wouldn't I'd have Bruno BR way at West Ham over over no home you said home to Southampton with bner sent off yeah slight go post slight exaggeration but but yeah like when once you start looking at once you put F and pal Watkins and Harland team you ain't got a lot of money yeah yeah that's true that is true okay you money right onto our teams you've made some you you've pushed some buttons mate so yeah I'll push him BS the other night y I got bit Tri trigger happy tell world I put I put .4 in the bank because I actually don't know how much you got in the bank how much do you have in the bank I think .3 .3 in the bank actually um but uh I love it J it you I'm never leaving that can't do it no chance I was supposed to ask you before we started but we got uh we're a bit too late carry on so um so I've just spent the whole thing talking about how good defensively look for art and how you should play them I saw Tren yeah and Absolut absolutely hate it that's that's how it works in it content creators that's what we do is we we tell people not to do something and then we do something else yes that's about yeah yes that's exactly how it works yeah um but uh yeah ultimately d was my problem um and and I want Palmer and I really just want Palmer and Son more than anything just want them in my team want to see them in my team and the only way I could do it um really was to sell Trent so I did that's that's it um there isn't much than that I've sold him I've got AI uh I put a on the bench he on my bench I play meleno I'll play Gabrielle play Lewis and hope for the best again why played 90 minutes yeah I like it yeah so it's Ry Louis meleno Gabrielle and defense Sun Palmer Rogers brumo and then salanki har DCL up top yeah every everyone at home apart from Spurs so I know it's it's good it's good I like it a lot it's good it's good it feels a very weird position as soon as you've got haven't got two transfers again JC says you could have bought Bruno Fernandez I could have and genuinely was tempted genuinely was tempted so if I was to have just saw Diaz it would have been to a man united player um whether it would have been down to garnacho or up to Bruno but Bruno was one I was looking at okay so for the first time Bruno was not banned from the transfers for me I don't think he's a bad buy at all you say you're saying you're evolving as a manager uh I'm saying that that man united look like they were evolving last weekend yeah which is a positive yeah tough place to go fibach here as well so I wouldn't I wouldn't wouldn't lay too much into this plus no Bruno no um this week as well so cool good what what would I do what would I do and what would you do if uh if it turns out sun's not okay uh I'd probably just play eight Nori yeah Fair off I mean I say that while you've got seeno as your first in fact no I'd probably just play seeno I'd play seeno yeah yeah I probably just play seeno cool um I have one free transfer I have3 in the bank myself uh my team currently sits as Martinez porro Gabrielle Lewis and Trent uh Rogers bumo McNeil son and then Harland and salanki up top uh I've got Johnson jeia Pedro Leaf Davis and E the more I look at Leaf Davis the more I can't believe I just didn't save an extra half a million then I wouldn't be get annoy myself that I'm short of money in a number of places so that's a bit annoying I contemplating moving on going like GES rather than leave Davis yeah just what any any 4.0 Defender anyone Vandenberg this week would be lovely wouldn't it like imagine if I just had him just so I could yeah get him in instead of a Trent or a Gabrielle and then I wouldn't have to think about making the transfer I could just park Trent on my bench or Park Gabrielle on my bench and just be happy with it but no no no no I've got Leaf Davis so um I have again we have to keep talking about a like he can't he's just going to sit there F on the bench at the moment uh mate I'm trying to get him out of my team I'm just trying to get him out of my team the further I can put him on the bench the closer he is to going out of my team is he actually first on the bench no no he's not I'm actually considering playing xia Pedro just in case he's fit and that's not even bench wanker that's like I would I would take I quite like it I'd take half hour xia Pedro at home to wolves to avoid probably hedging in that Liverpool Arsenal fixture because I hate hedging and I hate playing team playing things against each other you're not hedging it could be nil nil it could be nil nil that's true that's true it's not really it you're right it's not it's not a true hedge in in that sense no no nil nil a very possible result but yeah so a I mean I've toy with a down to down to nacho and then jaia Pedro up um because down to nacho gives me like seven and then jaia Pedro I can get up to Wood can I get up to Wood I can't think can't still not gonna happen we're never bringing chriswood team I can't I can't remember I was looking at it earlier now I can't now I can't remember what I was going to be doing this is very lson Kona stran Larson was definitely on the radar but um in terms of in terms of this week yeah I don't know JC saying e Barry my boy I mean like Palace are just terrible they're just a terrible team at the moment they're just they're just in a place where they are just bad and I know E's had some chances but he's he just been bad oh whistle was the one I was looking at actually no wher was the one I was so Xiao Pedro to wher I I I think I can actually just do it yeah it's it's it's I mean you know CU is playing Tottenham so if you ever need a team to sort you out when uh when it's not going so well then we'll find a way to help him out so you just know he's scoring um oh yeah I'm Point Too Short that's right yeah I'm Point too short I'm Point too short of wha so I was looking at e to gacho and and then um but then that's for a hit and it's like what's the point in taking a hit when I could just roll and have a perfectly good team and an extra transfer next week they're a big problem Palace they are a big problem like the other night against forest forest would just com in my opinion comfortly the better team and and mainly it was because it was everything was just I think feels really snatchy in the team like like and Keo all his shots were quite snatchy as a the number of times it's like block like shots are blocked all the time like they're taking plenty of shots but the lack of quality is just constant because it feels desperate it feels lack of identity it's it's such a weird world where you've got a a proper number nine Target man we spent all season last season talking about how he is a full matto is a proper bully number nine you you can't go from that style to a style with antia like he's not that he relies on a good build up team around him to create and then he's that kind of fox in the Box type guy um or he's one where he'll drop a little bit and try and bang it with with his left like but he's he's not just haven't they haven't brought they haven't brought anyone in they almost like and Cat's and C's almost replaced e in terms of like het in terms of the head there but he needs almost replaced I sorry Alisa is what I meant but he he's more like IOU isn't he they be like I do you know what I mean than that the it's and ker and isar for Alis and a is like kind of similar profiles but not as good but a long long long way oh Alis is completely different um well smar isn't too disimilar to to Alis in style he's a One V one Winger yeah but he's I I'd say that Alise's yeah okay fair enough I'd say Alis is more more more technical has has definitely much much higher technical ability whereas isar is very much very direct like run past the player yeah yeah rather than rather than actually team the to when when sun's out we play t-o verer yeah who just runs past the player that's L that's what I'm saying is that they they've tried to do similar profile to similar profile but with much much worse players you're like that doesn't work that never works yeah um but they to not play Mata just I don't get it there must be a massive falling out so do you think still still going on from the Olympics when he said like I I want to go to the Olympics so I can't start the season with you guys Bas it's all yeah it's all bad it's all bad it's all bad yeah so I I think I'm probably going to roll I'm almost certainly not going to be playing e and the Spurs thing as well I've got a Spurs Defender there's all sorts of reasons that I can put into my head that won't make me play AA so yeah and if you were to sell a it would be what probably got an AO something like that as it stands yeah I don't think there's anyone better yeah the only way the only way I would improve a is if I sell Trent yeah it's the only way I can really improve him and you better just wait on that for a week but then I won't sell Trent next week that's the thing as you said like the back end and don't and then you won't sell Trent me so but that's okay that's okay not selling him next week is it yeah definitely I'd wait a week yeah so any questions anyone um just drop them in the chat we 46 minutes that's not bad for us it's good that's not bad it's not bad Peter red card yeah yeah we're done pretty much uh D says R yeah gimenez has been he's been excellent excellent and VI is getting better vict is getting better five in five five returns in five Everton brenford Palace wolves tough Victory away at Spurs I would say that home then Arsenal Liverpool so yeah it's good for the next four having Southampton at home after Arsenal and Liverpool and then away to Chelsea after just just stinks of like you're not having him you're not having you're not getting him for Southampton at home well you might I suppose if you bench him the problem is you've got such a good amount of depth in your in in your team I still just look at it and think I just hold hold on to J Pedro and hope that he's back for 12 yeah that's what I'm that's what I'm hoping and and waiting another week gets you closer to knowing that cuz don't get by the time we get to 12 you also got International break in that so you actually got quite a bit of time 12 12 is a 12 is a pivot spot as well and like I said already like I want Jackson and Palmer in 12 I like I want both of those players in 12 yeah so I I will probably make moves that that help me get to that position yeah yeah yeah um I think B surv you know there's a there's a perfectly there's a perfectly reasonable exit point on son in 12 um which is which is fine um so Palmer's relatively straightforward salanki can be you know if if if he continues to flatter to deceive in terms of shot volumes then he'll be easy to move on to be honest and I'd probably rather could you I can move back into the Midfield somewhere if I want more of the Spurs attack because like Dei still like 6.2 as well and he will play other games don't forget on a as well like I don't think you can really lose on a this week because he plays Tottenham either we fix him because we fix everybody and he's back on show and then he's got walls away and Fulham two really good pictures yeah if they get rolled over I see absolutely no way that glas is in a job next week yeah true and then and then we saw what happened well we saw exactly it's exact he he's first on the new manager bounce job like he was literally the second huton G was like new manager bounce I love that stuff yeah so regardless like he's probably a good pick next week yeah um questions who would you play at a meleno in ESR play Oh against each other as well I'll play meleno play meleno probably just yeah you know my throw my uh throw my mikeno bias in there as well I think Spurs are about to get another penalty you know um J asks is is Richie a threat to sanki minutes long term uh possibly but possibly a threat to some minutes too because I I also I'd rather have Richie play come on the left wi you than than Teo at the moment yeah yeah um I don't think I don't think like Richie is a different kind of player to the way sank is playing at the moment as well very I don't I don't think he can feel that that role yeah um would you walk call to bring Salah in next week ch's asked oh what's going to the question and he asked it a second time as well would I wild card to get s in next week I I don't have an issue with it I do still think that game week 12 like you said is there's some good swings in that in that game week 12 it would probably be that weak for me I'd almost be tempted to make the move but I'd be more tempted to take Harland out and bring Salah in next week and then World C potentially go week 12 and and do something else then yeah um would you possibly even later than that would you rather downgrade Watkins or salanki to three up funds for a Midfield upgrade well it's more funds you release if you do sanki but uh Watkins oh sorry yeah yeah if you do Watkins so but you can still get down to you can still get down as you say to to to like Strand lson and whatever else and that that frees you up two million how how high are you going up with your yeah it's it's a difficult it's difficult yeah it's difficult what I do think is you know mallison potentially is a bump to salanki minutes not a detriment to sanky minutes because prior to this week sank had to play every single game yes but now he doesn't have to play every single game yeah so that there might be a world where he's actually beneficial to his minutes and that he starts playing 90 every every League game because he doesn't need to play 0 in midweek yeah um we just don't know that yet so uh I'm concerned about salanki you know the last couple of games of no shot whatsoever and the way it feels like he's doing a load of the good creative work to it um but Palace is a good fixture home to Villa is a good fixture home to ellip switch is a very good fixture yeah uh would you start mikeno or Gabrielle I start meleno I personally so before I made the Trent move I had Gabrielle in over above meleno but I hadn't I hadn't given any consideration um I I'd probably still give I'd probably still play Gabrielle yeah have I tried the fireable whiskey sour yet no I haven't um a whiskey sour apparently we have to love a whiskey sour sorry I love a whiskey sour you need to try the fireable whiskey sour apparently then I I think Jimmy I think Jimmy sent it to me I think Jimmy sent me like a recipe thing on um on on Twitter so see could do do a fire whiskey s on Sunday night uh HGI says just joined are you two triple captaining I am not because I played mine in game week two and got a hattrick nice touche uh from from from Harland so I'm I'm good and I'm not you're not so the big thumbnail triple Captain Harland we are not still think still think it's good still think it's a good week to do it though yeah I do I do I I think it's I think it's a better way and not necessarily because he scored a couple of goals in midweek but more because actually dku is out I think that's just a natural bump is there there's no doku messing it up yeah um but um and therefore I just think you've got guaranteed 90 minutes fair enough uh last couple go down go down to Roberto who's FPL yellow Army so da a first ask free active free hit active would you go son or foden this week free hit oh F him this week yeah okay cool uh bench one of DCL or seeno bench s menu y I am you are yes you literally are uh and then ask would you start Trent or Gabrielle uh oh I would start the home Defender i' real okay cool JC says nice Flex uh yes exactly that was on purpose uh um Good Luck for game week 9 thanks again as always for joining us almost 200

by baker evening mate how you doing not too bad mate not too bad not too bad thursday night friday deadline not long to go i like friday deadlines it just feels like you can finish work get your team done and then you can just youre just out youre just out of it sday morning just so irritating and they like the 1230 stuff you just feel like you feel like youre just constantly thinking about it from about 9 to about 1100 whats going on whats going to happen i like it no control deadlines done relax its weird one though for me because on a on a saturday morning normally im taking the little one to dancing and so then i get half an hour to myself while shes there sitting in the car so i can flick onto a stream i can search twitter i can jump on discord chat with the patrons i can do all that stuff in that half hour and be just ready to go i give her a lift to gymnastics we turn up at about 5 to 11 and then its like right i got five more minutes she runs off and its like okay i can get any moves that i need to do done so i dont mind it i dont mind it personally but no i can get the appeal i can get the appeal of a of a friday deadline for sure theres not even a l lunch time kickoff is it saturday i have no idea mate i have no idea so switched off so its lester forest leester forest tomorrow night 800 and then next game is straight into it 300 loads of them well four of them not loads this the time im maybe im just not paying attention so much because im not thinking im going to do much this week spoiler alert i just dont think i just dont think im going to be doing loads spurs are on at the moment yep so weve timed this perfectly as always timed it perfectly brenon johnsons coming on for the second half just fyi couple of people in the stream said it was lagging a little bit but a few hours have refreshed and it seems like its okay good doesnt look like its lagging on my side no drop frames nothing like that so hopefully we should be okay so just refresh your stream if youre if it is doing that and hopefully we should be just good so hello to everyone in the youtube chat and there is a poll out it is the question of the week do you want to be triple captain in harland yes no or let us know if youve played it already let us know in the comments lets see what youre going to be doing and i can imagine so did you see earlier on when andy sent out a message sent out a tweet he was like im thinking about doing this thinking about doing this and just was talking about transfers and he already changed his triple captain was active on harand just sitting there in the image first 20 comments no one noticed first 20 comments no one noticed and and then somebody down bit further down picked it up i said i see that little white chip there i see it there sneaking in so if you want a if you want a yard stick on whether were going to be hitting 200 eo like andy mirs lets talk fpl if hes got it on its going to be high its going to be high i think its its going to be do i think itll be 230 240 something like that no i dont think it will be i think itll be like 210 maybe and that is quite interesting isnt it because quite a lot of people have played it already okay quite a lot quite a lot of people are going to play it normally you dont get this like some did it here some did it here some did it there like last season virtually everyone did it in the same place see someone i was chatting i was half chatting to someone on x last week i cant remember when i played mine i cant remember we played it game we 27 was it hland everyone did that game 27 hland i cant remember genuinely gen i cant remember but everyone did it like we remember the end of the season thing we did the sort analysis looked at all the different places to see who when did people play and everyone played in the same place okay thats true thats true a couple more people are saying that theyre having problems with the stream i am not sure why that is to be honest because as i say ive got this little thing that says dropped frames normally when the when the it lags and even crypto block dan saying it as well and he has the best internet in the world so this is very interesting lets see if i can lets see if i can press a few buttons if you lose you i apologize but i dont like it when you press a few buttons man i dont know i dont know what else im supposed to do mate to be honest lets see if we can f b justor did you do that did you press the button to make fan of b score no but thats not a bad thing is it theres enough people say work its fine i think we just i think we just we just crack on we just crack on okay well if you are managing to see the screen and you are enjoying the content that we do make sure you drop a like on the video bergell has just missed from two yards and taking the keeper out and if you like if you want to see more then make sure you subscribe and thanks to everyone in the chat for joining us and we can we can just go straight into the games lets go straight in the games mate lets get it done straight in the games we got to be short because its friday deadline so were limited time frames here so we are lot lets do it do it get out cool so standard graphic rob t just showing us the expected goals and percentage probability chances of clean sheets no surprises city stick out as the prime fixture in fact we were normally looking as you say before previously teams are looking to score over two goals and its pretty much there are a couple there but its city or bust feels like a city or bust week 335 expected goals with a 50 chance of a clean sheet and and southampton with the only team thats expected to score less than one goal or not expected to score a goal slam d fixture absolutely its a slam d picture is what it is i think brenford and brighton both on 2xg or more we ask are we starting to see are we starting to see three or four teams that we can look at every week when were looking at looking at picking teams to target like historically its been its been big four plus or big six like thats where you thats where you see it the big attacks but well weve seen brighton up there before weve seen brighton up there before definitely under desery a few times and but brighton with no striker no its surprising that is a little bit surprising well becks definitely not making it and j pedro not either dont know about ferguson after coming off early last week its im surprised im surprised about it and i dont think its rare that youll go into a week where youll have a team where thats got virtually no ownership in terms of the attack and theyve got an expected goals of 215 in a week georgino 55 hes is an interesting pick now on if you were on wild cart this week i think i think he genuinely is quite interesting probably hard to trust many of the others in that but is he interesting enough that youd pick him say over rogers continues to liver villa got 185 expected goals you probably have him would you have georginio over mcneel probably not probably not because the like the guarantee of minutes the guarantee of involvement set pieces at space id still think id like mcneil probably over georgino i think i think its a tough one brighton looking at this one is it makes you sway towards could i get anything there but just i just dont see theyre about to walk into liverpool and city i think its a its its a complete nondiscussion with everton who like fulham southampton west ham brenford compared to wolves leicester sorry wolves liverpool city i just think i just think those three fixtures those next two fixtures if it was on wild card i would just be i would be swerving brighton because just unless youve unless youve got transfers in the bank like if you got three or four transfers and youre on a wild card then cool go for a punt and use one to get out of it and you might go you might just go from one team to the other you just go from a brighton to a to a wolves maybe although there arent any real midfielders from wolves that you want to be fair a lot of people with at nori now very popular this week and and like hes going in as a defender against a team that were expected two goals against you wouldnt normally play defenders against a team thats expected two goals against so hes a stash and he definitely are you are you looking up because rardon has scored i didnt know he scored hes just about to take the penalty but thanks ah that was a penalty was it he just staring down ive got notification im not watching it i got notification hes staring it down jcs brought up an interesting an interesting point and we will discuss that later on we have got a we have got a graphic for for a free hit n team because it is is an option particularly if youve got you if youre low on brighton the difficulty is as weve said with brighton is that they dont have any strikers so that you could go you could go boma georgino and then what 30y at the back i think i think so well look at that free hit in a minute but i think ill put rogers in on that free hit team and i think bear in mind giorginos probably got pens as well this weekend ill probably go georgino over rogers but then again i told you last week to go e over rogers and watch the scores so thats thats the difficulty when its a its a relatively good game for them this i think is people will be looking at watkins and potentially again still thinking do i sell him do i do because of the other shiny toys you might want to get the foden the palmer all those type of players but 185 has a massive share of the goals watkins is still fantastic in my opinion this week brenford if you after cheap striker this week so like chris wood we have a chance to talk about chris wood cuz he scored monday night you could look at it and say whiss back good fixtures long good fixtures we dont know we dont know hes back though right hes at a half hour which is fine were not talking about a son palmer saaka type job where you where you take you take the risk because how important they are to the team and that they can have an immediate impact because of the individual quality of the player now im not saying whis is not a good player i think hes a good player but hes not a great player no that said i think say i use the pun for you i think brenford will farm big chances they will against the old tractor boys and so hes going to be hes going to be one thats going to be a huge beneficiary of that bumo as well it was weird i had a discussion with someone on x earlier they just sent me a little dm asking me a few like questions which nobody ever does so i was like well okay and he was like would you sell dcl for wha and i said no on that one just because i think that i just think that everton will continue to generate good chances over the next three or four weeks and i just think that transfer might be better used elsewhere on a pivot and gw 12 type vibe so again one week punt maybe well one week punt definitely if youre on free hit i would have him but i dont think i think id be comfortable enough just having bumo in that fixture i just think but just go back to these cheap strikers i think weve all danced around chriswood most of us have not everyone because more than 10 of the game had him the other night when he scored like its a long time now i think they pulled up pulled up like last 38 games like that last 38 games like a calendar season as it were and only palmer and harlem more goals in him which is insane what are we mocking about like why isnt isnt wood just set and forget leave him there thanks i agree is this the right it sounds like it should be the right entry point but is a is a way derby the right entry point i dont probably not like were all going to keep saying is it worth it but its probably just some reflections for us is like when it came to wild card you went and ker i went dcl we were looking for stuff when the thing that we continually talk about is nuno loves him where weve had this bit where we were like were not sure if we love him and maybe we like taio better and all this stuff but the fact is the manager absolutely loves him hasnt stopped picking him up for a year hes just hes just a good ive been ive been hot on him since 2019 mate and i still cant pick ive dont think ive ever still cant pick him its stupid its it doesnt it doesnt make a huge even when he was at burnley i was like ill go ashley barnes over him and things like that its its weird like when the opportunity is there i think is at some point is well make that move the entry point as i say we talk about entry point like if you dont get this fixture like you want probably four fixtures to be honest you want four or five fixtures out of it and if you lose the promoted side one its like well its just a little bit worse now because instead of the next five to west ham we just saw what west ham did i know im just thinking like instead of being in instead of being leicester as the entry point and the next five fixtures ending in ips your entry point is west ham and it ends with city and youre like well thats stupid isnt it and then doesnt make sense doesnt make sense its its now its now or its never but what well do is well go were not going to do it then because then hes got like a way to arsenal but then hes home to i switch i dont think i can get to him anyway i dont think i can reasonably get to him without a hit thats the thing if i could move xia pedro to him i would just do it well always find reasons well always find reasons to him but just some positive positives for him other than that this week spurs good fixture all looks of things 19 i think its interesting how the bookies have are now seeing arsenal liverpool if you looked at last year a klo game in this one like 28 expected goals between the two teams is low you virtually got the same expected goals in everton fulham as you do in arsenal liverpool thats quite interesting theres only theres only leicester forest and everton fulham they have lower expected goals than arsal liverpool this weekend thats going to be down to thats as you say like its not a its a klo thing theyre a lot more conser not conservative they a lot more controlled in buildup arent they liverpool and they havent and they havent been they arent going to put theyre not going to do it to arsenal but they arent they dont look like theyre going to score three or four goals in a game well they look like it liverpool looked like if they went two and0 up they just wouldnt let they just they just shut up shot completely completely i think i think its i think its still a good fixture for the defenders i do like its its not a disastrous fixture feels ki i wouldnt be surprised if it walked away a n youd also wouldnt be surprised if it finished one all or 21 either so its not its not probably its not probably a 20o game for the defenders either no saying that is gabrielle got the 15p pointer against tottenham like those set pieces set pieces could be big for tren and gab its its just a just a toughy one we werent planning on talking about tottenham but im going to blame that dom in the chat said is will madison play well hes looking around now i dont think hes on the pitch now i think he its very interesting that he started tonight and not saw that was something i wasnt well i didnt know how much andrew was going to rotate tonight i know we had the we know about son i dont think theres any worries about son whatsoever not in plans for the game and sess that doesnt doesnt scream like theres an issue just screams like im just managing minutes but it does look like hes been taken off at half time unless no teo went off at half time madison on the pitch and n other moves made so far 60 minutes in so i think thats a worry for madison i think that is a worry is they they quite often will play three in the middle and all that stuff and i just i do wonder if from that last game the sar basuma and keski midfield maybe just thinks its more solid maybe as an away game definitely be i definitely be a little anxious if i was a madison owner i dont know this is this is a home game and you only 45 minutes maybe he just needs to get more minutes in his legs like would we be bothered would we be bothered about him if hed have played 85 minutes and then played 30 minutes today i dont think i be he did get taken off at half time for tactical reasons thats but i said i said at the weekend thats specific to the way the game was going now if he thinks that were going to have the same problem against palace i dont know its its definitely not good though is it no theres no theres no way we spin it in this is a good thing no thats fine so its its its definitely a problem and if somehow madison doesnt play then its good for parro its great par other ones on this man united look good chelsea look good look good we better just look at the main man then man city so we know theres no doku this weekend we know theres no greish this weekend i think the one thing is thats definitely its definitely a bump for har of minutes and its definitely a bump for photom minut it isnt it what choice they got sounds like f and left well the only thing is i dont know will play fod and left or play left and then bernardo right play bernardo right yesterday second half he played monas nunes on the left there is also that and he was good didnt just play on the left he was good on the left would so wouldnt surprise me if he played all of those he just said there is and foden stays central i think i think he just i think it just it does feel like end of the last season he was just bins now central player and i think i do think that will continue i think the reason why i bought toinho is and his plan doku and all those things is that he just doesnt see boden as that as that wide man anymore so i do think i do think hell still play central but it could be sininho and bernardo feels like probably what it is and then what kovic and bernardo in the middle i dont think theyre going to need much defensive no defensive defensive work doing at the weekend i can imagine that past map is going to look very interesting i do good for good for v well i think if nunes is there im not sure it is as good im not sure it is as good for vardal but hey maybe he doesnt need to because he bangs him in from 20 yards anyway so if he passes to him because if he always goes out on the outside then maybe not maybe not v ill just find ways of scoring true it is it is it is what it is and they have 50 chance for clean like viio should be a good pick the question is you do you do you want to spend six million on vardal if you havent got him a lot of money is its a lot of money i do think so trent to vario for example i do think just liverpool are miles better defensively theyre miles better defensively theyre incredible defensively im not sure im not sure id save that million quid would you back would you the fixtures i wouldnt back the fixtures though over the next few i know they get i back this fixture but post this fixture id back liverpools fixtures theyve got brighton liw brighton and then they got they got two home both at home theyre both at home but its still brighton and villa i if you ask me brighton and villa at home or bourma from brighton away from man city if you ask me to take the bet well have that bet all day long mate ill take you any day any day of the week this is man city one clean sheet since game week one absolutely diabolical defensively two away games i dont think theyre good cleans liverpool just went out to lipick and cleaned like theyre cleaning everybody okay they give one chance up to liverpool to chelsea ar arsenal theyre away to arsenal expected 15 goals like these are these are a good defense i dont i wouldnt like a trent to valar move thats thats for me i think you have to i just think youd have to have not side about five transfers in the bank it depends on what youre going to do with a million quid i dont know i dont know how much how much you can improve your sigh with a million quid though in midfield or attack and thats the point thats why i dont think its worth it because i dont think youre getting enough bang for your buck with that extra million quid thats why thats why i think if youre going to get off you just you just jump fair enough hence thats what ive done captaincy triple cap to captaincy harland do you think thats an absolute nobrainer or could you see yourself going elsewhere do you look at the goal projections lets have a look at the go protections so harand projected 136 i think for reference when he played it switch it was 135 so the same palmer 65 is next so hes expected to score at least one more goal or dble sorry not at least one more goal hes expected to score double of any other player in the league this week so captaincy a lock triple captaincy an option it is he scores ridiculous goal in the mid last night and if we look at the times so this is the third time this season that hes had expected goals or projected goals we to say of more than one against brenford grace against ipswitch hatrick it effing suggests youre going to get 13 points minimum if you do triple captain him and its 13 points its a clear 13 point points on the field yes thats huge i expect models will have him somewhere like nines early nines like that as a prediction but either way its going to be a good clean amount of points against the field its its a i couldnt put anyone off it that was trying choosing to do it im just goingon to personally is im although its been pretty much a disaster of season so far i dont i still feel like id like to hold on to it thats thats just how i feel with it i think this season more than any season like bonus points reward the attacker i like that if i can have two games if i can have a talisman in two games and preferably a midfield talisman in two games i just think its it gives me just a fantastic opportunity from the bonus perspective realistically i dont value the chip that highly anyway like its one time this player isnt it thats what it is how many times how many points do you think that player is gonna get in a week and you get that extra that is that is what it is but definitely would put it on off it for me im id i just want to hold on to it and if you didnt have harland you just kept who if you didnt have harland because theres people dont have harland that wont be free hitting to get him in i think i prefer the i think i prefer the boomo pick because i think if you havent got holland youve definitely got boomo everyone loads of people have got boomo i think thats the fun thats the fun pick this week i definitely i like i would go boomer over palmer as c to b cool were in agreement there were in agreement i do wonder if those odds just seeing this world back currently projected 58 i think once bookies maybe realize that hes definitely not playing i wonder how much whether that does have a big old dent in the in the projected goals for brighton on that those data we saw true but other than that look watkins jackson wood still here ahead of son as well wood is ahead of son wood is ahead of salanki wood is ahead of esack and wood is ahead of the striker thats probably going to be playing against ip witch which is i a bit i feel a bit stupid on the wood thing on the thing it is what it is mate it is what it is jc saying triple captain chris wood maybe thats the way maybe that is the way do you want look at team lets go look at it okay so i got move off the bench now i for who though g rogers rers okay fair enough so youd have wood over whis in this in this week yes said that i know it just said that but i you just said i dont know hes but i would i know but i would i know i would still take that free hit you want the friday night game youre free hit you want the friday night game id still take that punt i would back myself over the bookies in that sorry k got double defense mate just get van no mate these guys are scoring for fun just go full triple brighton at the back anyway free hit team veran in goal p collins and dunk at the back bumo foden gundan palmer in midfield rogers is on screen not for long watkins wood and harland up top yes rogers fabianski mikeno and justin on the bench its its its a good way if you havent got harland i wouldnt break my team up to har id free hit this week its a fun week to do it i still probably would prefer well ian maybe im talking from a position where ive already triple captained i think i much now that i ive locked ive locked a chip away i would probably be looking to wait for a double for my free hit and so if you didnt free hit would you would you just take the gamble on bumo as opposed to breaking up the team get harded i just captain him bumo i just captain bumo i cant ging anyway on the harland thing are cu because youre going to get him into captains it but youre not gain on it because it give be 200 anyway no youre not going to gain on it but youre not goingon to youre gna avoid losing on it right youre going to avoid losing youre going to youre going to avoid losing on it people say like you dont gain anything well yes i do i gain harland thats what i get i get i get the harland points whereas i would have done before but we have just looked here and said getting 13 points so imagine is owner you dont own youre 26 points down on the field when have you ever looked at fpl optimized and been minus 26 and gone i can recover from this like you dont youre just youre weeks dead your weak is dead i would i would gondo is won for me hes taking set pieces he just is a bully in these games weve seen him do it internationally weve seen him do it for city he just hang around in the box he just hang around in the box and he just always scores in these games and hes owned you would not be i would genuinely not be surprised if hes sc a hat trick this weekend he be straight in for me over aario because i think youve got a good opportunity i would i still like pinck and collins because they setpiece threat is so big ips which you got no greaves they got no twan a you just got to go at it just got to go at it i would i that for me it would those are the players i would definitely go for you can walk around whether its wood whether its wi whether its rogers whether its georgino all of those type of ones but i think its i think its great i was tempted if a couple of people i was looking at this i was tempted with gacho over rogers was definitely one i looked at but again theres nothing wrong with rogers like i know its good youre going to look at it but technically still villa expected to score more goals than man united this week they didnt play thursday night man united are playing thursday night i like i do like but just like about probably just realizing the friday night games leer farest ill probably go ill probably go would i like nao for the next five weeks as well like hes a good pick for the next five weeks he was cheap legitim legitimately i was thinking about him this week i still am to be honest agreed agreed he hasnt done anything tonight i assume done absolutely nothing tonight dont know but the good thing is about him is last season he got ridden as a 90minut man and the last four games hes played 90 minutes so as soon as ten hog says youre my boy and youre playing again every minute a play time hes hes still on the pitch hes still on the pitch at the moment one shot hes hes got stamina for days js asking us wheres bruno couldnt afford it couldnt afford it because because the watkins thing youd have to lose watkins lose watkins get bruno get v no not going to that am i why would you on a fre walkins home to bournemouth you could have you could have bruno you have bruno at home to southampton and bner already sent off and id still have watkins bought home to bournemouth over bruno okay i wouldnt id have bruno br way at west ham over no home you said home to southampton with bner sent off slight go post slight exaggeration but like when once you start looking at once you put f and pal watkins and harland team you aint got a lot of money thats true that is true okay you money right onto our teams youve made some youve pushed some buttons mate so ill push him bs the other night y i got bit tri trigger happy tell world i put i put 4 in the bank because i dont know how much you got in the bank how much do you have in the bank i think 3 3 in the bank but i love it j it you im never leaving that cant do it no chance i was supposed to ask you before we started but we got were a bit too late carry on so so ive just spent the whole thing talking about how good defensively look for art and how you should play them i saw tren and absolut absolutely hate it thats thats how it works in it content creators thats what we do is we tell people not to do something and then we do something else yes thats about yes thats exactly how it works but ultimately d was my problem and i want palmer and i just want palmer and son more than anything just want them in my team want to see them in my team and the only way i could do it was to sell trent so i did thats thats it there isnt much than that ive sold him ive got ai i put a on the bench he on my bench i play meleno ill play gabrielle play lewis and hope for the best again why played 90 minutes i like it so its ry louis meleno gabrielle and defense sun palmer rogers brumo and then salanki har dcl up top every everyone at home apart from spurs so i know its its good its good i like it a lot its good its good it feels a very weird position as soon as youve got havent got two transfers again jc says you could have bought bruno fernandez i could have and genuinely was tempted genuinely was tempted so if i was to have just saw diaz it would have been to a man united player whether it would have been down to garnacho or up to bruno but bruno was one i was looking at okay so for the first time bruno was not banned from the transfers for me i dont think hes a bad buy at all you say youre saying youre evolving as a manager im saying that man united look like they were evolving last weekend which is a positive tough place to go fibach here as well so i wouldnt i wouldnt wouldnt lay too much into this plus no bruno no this week as well so cool good what would i do what would i do and what would you do if if it turns out suns not okay id probably just play eight nori fair off i say that while youve got seeno as your first in fact no id probably just play seeno id play seeno i probably just play seeno cool i have one free transfer i have3 in the bank myself my team currently sits as martinez porro gabrielle lewis and trent rogers bumo mcneil son and then harland and salanki up top ive got johnson jeia pedro leaf davis and e the more i look at leaf davis the more i cant believe i just didnt save an extra half a million then i wouldnt be get annoy myself that im short of money in a number of places so thats a bit annoying i contemplating moving on going like ges rather than leave davis just what any 40 defender anyone vandenberg this week would be lovely wouldnt it like imagine if i just had him just so i could get him in instead of a trent or a gabrielle and then i wouldnt have to think about making the transfer i could just park trent on my bench or park gabrielle on my bench and just be happy with it but no ive got leaf davis so i have again we have to keep talking about a like he cant hes just going to sit there f on the bench at the moment mate im trying to get him out of my team im just trying to get him out of my team the further i can put him on the bench the closer he is to going out of my team is he first on the bench no hes not im considering playing xia pedro just in case hes fit and thats not even bench wanker thats like i would i would take i quite like it id take half hour xia pedro at home to wolves to avoid probably hedging in that liverpool arsenal fixture because i hate hedging and i hate playing team playing things against each other youre not hedging it could be nil it could be nil thats true thats true its not it youre right its not its not a true hedge in that sense no nil a very possible result but so a ive toy with a down to down to nacho and then jaia pedro up because down to nacho gives me like seven and then jaia pedro i can get up to wood can i get up to wood i cant think cant still not gonna happen were never bringing chriswood team i cant i cant remember i was looking at it earlier now i cant now i cant remember what i was going to be doing this is very lson kona stran larson was definitely on the radar but in terms of in terms of this week i dont know jc saying e barry my boy like palace are just terrible theyre just a terrible team at the moment theyre just theyre just in a place where they are just bad and i know es had some chances but hes he just been bad whistle was the one i was looking at no wher was the one i was so xiao pedro to wher i think i can just do it its its its cu is playing tottenham so if you ever need a team to sort you out when when its not going so well then well find a way to help him out so you just know hes scoring im point too short thats right im point too short im point too short of wha so i was looking at e to gacho and then but then thats for a hit and its like whats the point in taking a hit when i could just roll and have a perfectly good team and an extra transfer next week theyre a big problem palace they are a big problem like the other night against forest would just com in my opinion comfortly the better team and mainly it was because it was everything was just i think feels snatchy in the team like and keo all his shots were quite snatchy as a the number of times its like block like shots are blocked all the time like theyre taking plenty of shots but the lack of quality is just constant because it feels desperate it feels lack of identity its its such a weird world where youve got a proper number nine target man we spent all season last season talking about how he is a full matto is a proper bully number nine you cant go from that style to a style with antia like hes not that he relies on a good build up team around him to create and then hes that fox in the box type guy or hes one where hell drop a little bit and try and bang it with his left like but hes hes not just havent they havent brought they havent brought anyone in they almost like and cats and cs almost replaced e in terms of like het in terms of the head there but he needs almost replaced i sorry alisa is what i meant but hes more like iou isnt he they be like i do what than that the its and ker and isar for alis and a is like similar profiles but not as good but a long way alis is completely different well smar isnt too disimilar to alis in style hes a one v one winger but hes id say that alises okay fair enough id say alis is more technical has definitely much higher technical ability whereas isar is very direct like run past the player rather than rather than team the to when suns out we play to verer who just runs past the player thats l thats what im saying is that theyve tried to do similar profile to similar profile but with much worse players youre like that doesnt work that never works but they to not play mata just i dont get it there must be a massive falling out so do you think still going on from the olympics when he said like i want to go to the olympics so i cant start the season with you guys bas its all its all bad its all bad its all bad so i think im probably going to roll im almost certainly not going to be playing e and the spurs thing as well ive got a spurs defender theres all sorts of reasons that i can put into my head that wont make me play aa so and if you were to sell a it would be what probably got an ao something like that as it stands i dont think theres anyone better the only way the only way i would improve a is if i sell trent its the only way i can improve him and you better just wait on that for a week but then i wont sell trent next week thats the thing as you said like the back end and dont and then you wont sell trent me so but thats okay thats okay not selling him next week is it definitely id wait a week so any questions anyone just drop them in the chat we 46 minutes thats not bad for us its good thats not bad its not bad peter red card were done pretty much d says r gimenez has been hes been excellent and vi is getting better vict is getting better five in five returns in five everton brenford palace wolves tough victory away at spurs i would say that home then arsenal liverpool so its good for the next four having southampton at home after arsenal and liverpool and then away to chelsea after just stinks of like youre not having him youre not having youre not getting him for southampton at home well you might if you bench him the problem is youve got such a good amount of depth in your in your team i still just look at it and think i just hold on to j pedro and hope that hes back for 12 thats what im thats what im hoping and waiting another week gets you closer to knowing that cuz dont get by the time we get to 12 you also got international break in that so you got quite a bit of time 12 is a 12 is a pivot spot as well and like i said already like i want jackson and palmer in 12 i like i want both of those players in 12 so i will probably make moves that help me get to that position i think b surv theres a theres a perfectly theres a perfectly reasonable exit point on son in 12 which is which is fine so palmers relatively straightforward salanki can be if he continues to flatter to deceive in terms of shot volumes then hell be easy to move on to be honest and id probably rather could you i can move back into the midfield somewhere if i want more of the spurs attack because like dei still like 62 as well and he will play other games dont forget on a as well like i dont think you can lose on a this week because he plays tottenham either we fix him because we fix everybody and hes back on show and then hes got walls away and fulham two good pictures if they get rolled over i see absolutely no way that glas is in a job next week true and then and then we saw what happened well we saw exactly its exact hes first on the new manager bounce job like he was the second huton g was like new manager bounce i love that stuff so regardless like hes probably a good pick next week questions who would you play at a meleno in esr play against each other as well ill play meleno play meleno probably just my throw my throw my mikeno bias in there as well i think spurs are about to get another penalty j asks is richie a threat to sanki minutes long term possibly but possibly a threat to some minutes too because i also id rather have richie play come on the left wi you than teo at the moment i dont think i dont think like richie is a different player to the way sank is playing at the moment as well very i dont i dont think he can feel that role would you walk call to bring salah in next week chs asked whats going to the question and he asked it a second time as well would i wild card to get s in next week i dont have an issue with it i do still think that game week 12 like you said is theres some good swings in that in that game week 12 it would probably be that weak for me id almost be tempted to make the move but id be more tempted to take harland out and bring salah in next week and then world c potentially go week 12 and do something else then would you possibly even later than that would you rather downgrade watkins or salanki to three up funds for a midfield upgrade well its more funds you release if you do sanki but watkins sorry if you do watkins so but you can still get down to you can still get down as you say to like strand lson and whatever else and that frees you up two million how high are you going up with your its its a difficult its difficult its difficult what i do think is mallison potentially is a bump to salanki minutes not a detriment to sanky minutes because prior to this week sank had to play every single game yes but now he doesnt have to play every single game so that there might be a world where hes beneficial to his minutes and that he starts playing 90 every league game because he doesnt need to play 0 in midweek we just dont know that yet so im concerned about salanki the last couple of games of no shot whatsoever and the way it feels like hes doing a load of the good creative work to it but palace is a good fixture home to villa is a good fixture home to ellip switch is a very good fixture would you start mikeno or gabrielle i start meleno i personally so before i made the trent move i had gabrielle in over above meleno but i hadnt i hadnt given any consideration id probably still give id probably still play gabrielle have i tried the fireable whiskey sour yet no i havent a whiskey sour apparently we have to love a whiskey sour sorry i love a whiskey sour you need to try the fireable whiskey sour apparently then i think jimmy i think jimmy sent it to me i think jimmy sent me like a recipe thing on on twitter so see could do a fire whiskey s on sunday night hgi says just joined are you two triple captaining i am not because i played mine in game week two and got a hattrick nice touche from harland so im im good and im not youre not so the big thumbnail triple captain harland we are not still think still think its good still think its a good week to do it though i do i do i think its i think its a better way and not necessarily because he scored a couple of goals in midweek but more because dku is out i think thats just a natural bump is theres no doku messing it up but and therefore i just think youve got guaranteed 90 minutes fair enough last couple go down go down to roberto whos fpl yellow army so da a first ask free active free hit active would you go son or foden this week free hit f him this week okay cool bench one of dcl or seeno bench s menu y i am you are yes you are and then ask would you start trent or gabrielle i would start the home defender i real okay cool jc says nice flex yes exactly that was on purpose good luck for game week 9 thanks again as always for joining us almost 200

8,fplbanger,FHXo_fhw-UE,"FPL GW9: WE&#39;VE GOT WOOD, SON - FPL 2024/25",2024-10-23T06:28:48Z,as a nonh Highland owner I just I I guess I would just take the hit and have faith that it's a strategy over a long time period and not a game week you know you can't just look at a single game week beir you were always very confident that uh call it confidence call it h I wouldn't say confident after after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit I'm not going to lie but I stuck with the decision and it paid off I pity the people who miss out the Halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks oh this thing hello everyone welcome back to the fbl bangers show my name is Sila I'm joined by Sam game week nine preview Sam but Sam I'm seeing a lot of uh initial content this week uh about how game week eight was worst game week ever disaster I feel I I feel like I'm out of sync with the the rest of the FPL uh you know Community how about you s yeah same SAA same SAA but you know why SAA it's because you have a really good FPL player as your Port mate who convinced you not to make stupid decisions last week like take out Muhammad Salah I I I will readily accept that I I mean had you not told me like what are you doing why do you want Phil for and he never starts but I I almost certainly would have made that move so thank you sir just doing my job SAA just doing my job so good week for both of us I mean especially good week for you we had 52 I had 42 both green arrows 52 with 10 players with my my second most expensive player my team not starting which is Saka and I have all my bench players didn't play um not you know so yeah and and to be fair not your bench wasn't like you know non-playable you had coner gaves you just you got unlucky but didn't matter in the end yeah it didn't matter they would have given me like one point anyway so it's a one point difference and so okay so we we both had good weeks and we we're quite happy and and to be fair I think both our seasons are you know when you look around and shouldn't compared to you know content creators specifically but just in general right A lot of people are struggling down in the millions so we started off okay we're both doing all right um that being said Sam got to keep going um we've kept Salah throughout this entire period And as you can see on the screen now Salah now the top Point scorer what do you think about Salah going into this is it is it even difficult run of fixtures not really right I mean Arsenal is his last hard fixture and is that even fixure right now I think Liverpool can score in any game Salah can score in any game there is there are hard fixtures for the team Yes To Come Away with a win but I think Salah has just proven himself time and time again season after season and like I told you last week he has only blanked twice this entire season in eight games blanked twice and five of those were double digit Halls so come on why why are you even taking him out and I think it's some some alignment of stars has happened for Salah as well he got you know in sense that Chelsea didn't have Kara for far last week uh Arsenal most likely we're recording Wednesday morning I would say califur is probably not going to play he came off with the injury yesterday so no you know Salah against Arsenal against zenchenko is not going to be I mean that's a mismatch zko has barely played all season and then Sal also out sorry just to Sid trck a video see the interview with Z jenko about um his training session with pep I did I did tell tell tell the people what was it he he made one wrong pass pep you know basically scolded him for it and he's like I just made one wrong pass and pep very very pep like very sarcastically just say oh yeah okay okay and then he just ended the training session asked everyone to go in and I'm pretty sure immediately he went up to the B we're selling zenko right now and that's the story of to Arsenal passive aggressive but I mean it's a bit let's let's talk a bit about Arsenal right I mean are you concerned slash are you worried about how things have been going because theyve uh okay so against Lester and Southampton You could argue fluke goals but I was very surprised with how bourou turned out really stupid stupid decision from celba like you don't give the ref a chance to send you off that early in the game um making a tackle like that and so even against shakar last night very leggy just got across the line but coming into Arsenal's Runner fixures doesn't look great I mean we can show you on the screen um the here yeah so Arsenal's next fixtures Liverpool Newcastle Chelsea and then is Forest which I think we all agree now is harder fixture than he used to be so with that in mind I guess sideb barring from Salah to Arsenal assets what do you do with Aral assets going into this week uh I think the only Arsenal asset most people have would be Saka right and harvit U talking about attackers first right let's let's kind of separate it out so I think I was waiting for the Champions League we are recording this on um Wednesday morning so we've only seen the first round of games I was I think if Saka had started I would have kept him in my team but because he didn't start he didn't start last weekend I'm getting a bit worried so I think this is the week you know I sell Saka very begrudgingly though because when you look at how Saka has performed this season he's only blanked once of the seven games he's played right like I I think I said this maybe last week or the week before harand and salah's performance at the start of the Season kind of distorted people's perception of what a good FPL asset is you know what I mean if you're not scoring hat tricks every week then I don't want you but in any other season right you take a player who has only blank once in seven game weeks like that's as good as it gets you know yes it's not sexy it's not double digit halls but yeah very very good still however with the injuries and with the other options coming up I think this is the week I let go of uh Saka harits though would you would you sell harits I think if you have a Cher to spare I would because there are so many options now um further down but let's get into forwards later I think let's um stick with uh Arsenal First Defense though I'm happy to keep the defense I think because I don't really want to make a defensive move I think it's uh tricky I guess let's let's start off with the defense cuz that's the probably the easiest uh sort of sale to make in terms of you know you know in terms of funds it requires and all that I suppose your initial instinct is you look at these pictures and think you got to sell all their Defenders but we've always said this about Arsenal right we said this at the start of season hard fix just kind of where they they they rise to the occasion and they set out to defend I expect arsal to go against lpool and play for a draw and play for nil nil I especially if Sak's out like there's no attacking impetus in the side I would assume the same probably happens at St J spk possibly even at Stafford Bridge against Chelsea so I'm not in a rush to get rid of Defenders I get starting off with DAV ryer L I have David ryer you have David ryer as well so yeah yeah look he's a he's a goalkeeper M like like there will be a lot of uh recency bias because sells got 11 points this week ver Bren got 10 but keepers are not going to have double digit Halls most week so that is a position you don't make a transfer in there unless your keeper has basically got a six-month injury that's it you know otherwise you you you've got your keeper you've committed to him unless you have somebody like arola this really no reason to to make a transfer in that department Defenders Gabriel's still got attacking threat and that's not going to change so not a priority sale but if you're using him to fund moves elsewhere I'm actually okay with that because I think we've got a few budget Defenders who look interesting now and um and so with that in mind yeah yeah let's do that because I think uh you know of course you're not going in the order you expect to but I think that kind of makes sense if you're going to sell an Arsenal Defender who are you going to sell him for okay my number one budget Defender which will be one of my transfer St is Ryan anuri who I already mentioned last week now W fix just really turn this week onwards so yeah and Asa has on the screen Defenders with the most attacking returns Ryan anui at four joined with Nathan Collins very surprisingly Nathan Collins but yeah um so who's fixtures Brighton Palace Southampton wam bonemouth Everton West Ham it Swit Leicester before it starts to turn in game we 18 with United Spurs Forest Newcastle Chelsea so then it gets bad get them out then but you know that's a good uh eight weeks no I can't count yeah it's a good R good number of weeks good number of weeks so and he's really really attacking he basically plays like a Winger right in their formation um didn't do particularly well this week against City but you know it is against City but in every other week he's been underlying stats look good underlying numbers looks good Ryan Ani 4.4 my first choice budget Defender yeah and I should just point out this is a graphic from official FPL so I don't think that Lucas Dean place for Evon still um this [Laughter] is we're too lazy to make our own graphic so this is what happens when you start boring other people's content um yeah I I a very nice pick for me but I'm surprised you didn't mention someone else Sam and I come back here to the fixtures uh this is FDR Tak from Reddit uh as usual and top of the FDR chart is Everton and they have a four point come on yeah but they have a 4.3 million attacking Defender who you I I'm surprised Sam you didn't even mention him R moleno you've got Southampton yeah you love Michael and what Fulham Southampton West Ham brenford United wolves all decent fixtures brande I think brwi being out has always has been the real issue this season but he's I think almost back to full fitness meanwhile Michael Keane has turned into Karen Benzema or something I mean he's if you haven't seen Michael kean's goal this week against IPS which you go and check it out now because that is uh I mean you could have two keepers there they're not stopping that finish and I mean 4.3 million for M Eno obviously after I said jok Merson was a great option last week things happen yeah yeah but surely that that that can't happen again to M Eno I don't know you look at the fixure do you think they're keeping a clean she against Fulham no R himz is just on fire southon maybe West Ham although playing bad they're still scoring every single game Branford you think a clean sheet there United wolves I think it looks nicer on paper when you look closely I don't really see many clean sheets there for Everton I would rather go for brenford Defender Nathan Collins brenford have not kept a clean all season mate but he has attacking trap apparently he's been fluking these assists right I mean you can you look at this and this graphic is like oh wow you know Collins has four assist but let's you know we watch the games and even even like like the most casual person knows i n andan holl very different comparison you're getting Nathan Collins Center back who has been fortunate to get these assists and I I come back to brenford fixes okay yeah sure I switch may be a clean I don't think fulham's a clean game for them I don't think Bond's a clean I guess Sam perhaps what we're doing here you know you don't seem convinced by Mel Eno I'm not convinced by Branford Defenders maybe to your initial point we should probably keep the Arsenal Defenders because they play for a half decent team and decent teams are the ones that tend to keep cleans yeah and unless you really need the money I guess then then okay woles Defender that'll be my number one choice number two a forest Defender actually that will be my second choice who um are decent for fixures and have been keeping some clean sheets so I think they kept their third clean sheet of the season so far which is which is okay um and you can get multiple Defenders at 4.5 you could get Ola AA you could get milenovic so yeah Nia milenovic yeah very tall aial threat sent back from Florentina Yeah Yeah from Floren for me in my Florentina safe in FM oh you must be really sad about you I guess you'll be carrying on that save for another 12 months you must be very annoyed about FM not coming out yeah yeah I know but I I Sid tracking a bit I don't really get FM every year anyway because I'm I don't know to a new FM I have to start a new team but what about my old my current team you know haven't achieved all I wanted with them yet so that's that's a very positive I mean that's that's what they should instead of tweeting every day with their you know half apologies that's what they should say you know now you get to spend another year with your team um okay moving forward forward okay so Nica bankovich I I like he got the assist against Chelsea and he's yeah I think his arrival has definitely you've seen an upturn in Forest defense they don't concede from set pieces as you know nearly as often as they used to lot of improvement there the only thing is Forest fixtures as we have them on the screen here Leicester West Ham decent then it's Newcastle Arsenal City in the next four after that so if you can rotate him maybe uh although you know as we say Defender rotations aren't the best but if you can play somebody else in 12 and 14 and I guess if you're getting two cheap Defenders let's say you get rid of Gabrielle and you get two 4.5s you could have maybe an Everton defender in 12 and 14 or you could have a I don't know maybe you could have a even a walz Defender yeah 12 and 14 that's not too bad but you see if rotation issue I will go for wols Defender because great fixtures and even if the fixes doesn't look like cling [ __ ] Ry and has so much attacking potential you would just play him anyway so that's why they are my one number one pick and I know a lot of people you know they look back at the first eight games and like you know they've considered like a ungodly amount of goals but again if you look at the fixtures they have not played a single team below the top 10 right so every single team they've played has been uh in the top half of they've only played good teams so that their good run starts now let's see where it goes 4.5 is worth a risk I think or 4.4 actually yeah and I I think uh the city performance is very encouraging you know they they really uh reduce City to almost next to no attacking threat so okay I'm down with that shut down we got to talk about okay we'll get to Holland in a sec but just wrapping up Defenders real quick here uh just moving up in budget right cuz if you're selling the likes of Gabrielle I guess you're going down 5 million Defenders for me there's only one guy right it's Kate and you probably don't get konate this week unless you're on wild card but I think next week you get konate and you just park him in your team yeah agreed agreed you do save a lot of money oh I mean it depends from gabri you save about oh one mill exactly 6.3 to 5.3 so that's that's not nothing um and I think Pedro poro Sam you and I have not been convinced never been convinced and we remain UNC unconvinced yeah that pretty much sums it up for federal for and spur defense as a whole I think yeah takes takes a few good shots you'll get your hall eventually but we're not interested um ask about guardal here oh yes yes I was going to come to what do you think so no we've got this on the screen now I did not realize this but it's you know it sounds legit once you start thinking about it since uh the start of last season season no Defender scored more goals it's now six goals I I feel like scoring bangers he had that run like the last 10 games of last season where he just withing every single game he was insane one of those super annoying you know he can't keep this up and then he kept this up and he ruined your season if you didn't have him um I feel like scoring bangers is not sustainable and but some point City have to start keeping clich sheet right I mean this this not keep they do but it always starts at the second half of the season I don't know why people keep forgetting about it and I think it's recency biased because they end the season so strongly keeping clean sheets winning every single game that in the start of the new season people forget that in the first half they they never keep clean sheets before Christmas okay so so you are comfortable not to have gardio against South Apton yeah I mean maybe probably one clean sheet there but I'm you know I just feel with the price and everything I rather just get a budget Defender at this point and then pump it into the mids and forwards yeah I'm because I have Rico Lewis I'm content to sort of just hold on to that I think for the price I'm getting what I expected like yes gav's doing really well with these shots from 30 yards out but logically that just can't continue yeah and to that point Rico Lewis actually is is getting into more attacking positions than guardal so bangers aside you just look at their their heat map and the play style you would expect Rico Lewis to return more you know and he has shown that with assist this season which is which is a good return for a 4.5 Defender when we bought him yeah so I think I'm content you you get what you pay for Rico Lewis I think the value is there so happy to hold and I think Walker's got some injury issues which is also good for Lewis I think uh yeah he seems to have kept his place in the team regardless of what anyone else thinks about whether he is right for that slot um so I think that's defense right there's no nobody else to talk about in defense no I don't think so yeah so let's uh let's I was going to talk about mids but I want to come back to forwards because we're on city right let's talk about harand for a bit okay so you must be thrilled because yeah you have I am call it black black magic call it I don't know what what what kind of powers you're using I've captained this guy three weeks in a row for three blanks I told you not the captain this guy for three weeks in a row for his three blanks by the way see and I'm going to do it for fourth week in a row so at the end of gamei one I was ranked seven Mill for going without harand and thanks to you know his blanks I'm now 700k so my rank is inversely proportional to Holland's performance basically uh it's interesting right because if he blanks against Southampton I think if he does anything less than score two goals I expect people to sell him after Southampton like that is the mood now and we're all human you just We Can't Stop ourselves at this point if he blanks against Southampton like he's gone um gone is that rash don't I don't know he never my theme so now here's the point I'm just going to say for those people who started the season with hland the logic was not that your player would outscore Harland every single week the logic is that over a long enough sample size time period your two players so harand and a versus you know um Salah and a better budget player would outscore them and I think so far has shown to be true although I don't know is 10 games are short enough big enough sample size um we'll see now I do I do expect harand to score big this week traditionally he has always scored very very big when he plays a promoted side at home right so it doesn't get any better than this if I had I might even triple Captain him this week so as a nonland owner I just I guess I would just take the hit and have faith that it's a strategy over a long time period and not a game Weck you know you can't just look at a single game Weck okay so all fair points I guess my question is the fixtures are they I mean he's it's not like as if he's a cell with these fixtures right he's a cell Bas on form if we recognize form as a like a thing but after Southampton it's bnorth Brighton spurs in 12 we don't really think Spurs is a hard defense so maybe 13 right maybe 13 is where you might consider selling um I guess I suppose your point is that he's not a bad option just full stop and he will score goals but you can rebuild him with the funds that you're saving for yeah Money Ball Money Ball and and long enough to the season where you now feel confident well to be fair you were always very confident that uh call it confidence call it h I wouldn't say confident after after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit s I'm not going to lie but I stuck with the decision and it paid off I pity the people who missed out the Halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks so yeah that that's quite funny I mean I also I don't say I pity them I mean I'm laughing at them but sure let's let's go with pity um okay so I think howand easy it's not actually a question to think about so much this week because no one's selling him before Southampton uh and people like you who don't own are just hoping for the best is what I would assume I've seen some chat about using free hit this week for non Holland teams I think that's very shortsighted yeah I mean okay it depends it depends I I guess the the reasoning is that your other premium assets like Salah is playing Arsenal away Saka might not play you know all these other guys don't exactly have the greatest fixture so maybe that's the reasoning however I wouldn't I don't think it's worth a for hit in my personal opinion I wouldn't do it I'll wait for a bigger opportunity down the road yeah I mean like Salah is going to play and could return taka if you just play yeah you sell him you know you've got Alternatives I don't think free hit feels like yes City Southampton very good fixture yes you don't have harand you'll feel bad but use your funds you can get other players who could still do well this week and I think free hit's just too powerful a chip to throw away this early in the season where you don't know what blanks are going to happen you don't know how they will shape out and then you've used a chip for maybe maybe howand gets a brace I don't think a free hit is worth it and for the same reason or something like that yeah so triple capc is less risky because it's it's sort of a it's a it's a you're focusing on harand alone but even then for me Triple Captain is about Vibes and I'm just not feeling the Vibes now yeah so that's the thing there will never be Vibes for Holland because everyone owns him everyone fair but but I'm prepared I I'm prepared to wait for a dou game where there will be possible Vibes you know and at least I'll have a guaranteed four-pointer on my hands times three you know so I I am prepared to wait for that rather than uh throw it away this early in the season and also in the same way that owning chriswood was really nice this week because you got to Monday night and you still had you could see like some extra light at the end of the tunnel or you're in my case like this is just going to get better um I like having a triple Captain C for towards the back end of the season I really don't want to throw it away so early yeah fair enough I think okay emotional reasons but I mean if you want stats and other stuff you can go somewhere else this we all about Vibes here uh so on Saka you mentioned Saka let's talk about other premiums because we've covered harand we've covered Salah let's talk about Palmer and yeah so kmer where you at it probably be my transfer in this week probably you think Newcastle is in good fixture now yeah Newcastle is great fixture they're horrible and I think Palmer can return against anyone right like he has that quality he was close against Liverpool you know and I would say the three toughest fixtures in the season is when you're playing away against Liverpool away Arsenal and Away city right I'm I I fif in Palmer I think he would do really well so yeah Palmer in will probably be my transfer this week okay let's let's sort of jump back again we're sort of flipping through but let's look at his fixtures right he plays Palmer plays Newcastle then it's man united then it's Arsenal so that's his next three yeah but Arsenal home I which I think makes a big difference honestly in um DUIs fair and I'll take your point at pal can probably return against anyone he's got enough Roots he's got set pieces he's got pens uh he's got the ability to shoot it from 30 yards and goes in the only question I guess I have is would you rather have Palmer this week or would you rather have Sun now it's insane that I'm asking the question because I think a few weeks ago if you asked me would I want son anywhere near my team heck no but I think for us you know both of us didn't have Sun last week I think we got away with one like like he on another day he gets that assist right FPL eventually removed the assist for their own goal but on another day they they probably just leave that on another day he gets the goal right because he shot it at goal and then he goes in um he also hit the post after that and that sun on limited minutes just back from injury spur next three fixtures two of the next three look really good they play Palace Villa ipswitch so Palace and ips switch to me seems like a much better combo than Palmer's next three um so whilst I don't think I think sun's not not been in our thoughts because Spurs have been inconsistent but and I think partly also because both of us already have other SP assets like you have Brandon Johnson I have medicine I brought in last week so to double up I'm not so sure I think for us but looking in the perspective of someone who has no spur assets I think sun is a very interesting asset you know um he's I don't know why but it feels like he's always been a differential like even every season he's been in the league he's been a differential um somehow just gets overlooked and I think it's because he tends to return big in one game double digit Hall very high ceiling but then goes missing you know in terms of FPL points he blanks two games three games and then another big Hall two games three games so it becomes really frustrating for owners um so that'll be my warning for anyone who who is thinking about going to Sun you have to be able to weather the blanks if you want his returns uh I'm not strong enough so I'm going to go for Farmer although I'm not going to say sun is a bad asset right it's comparing you know a really good asset with another really good asset person I think fmer outscore Sun more than so I think the difference is price is about 1 mil right Sun's 9.9 Palmer's 10 eight yeah so I think Palmer will outscore him in the long run and I'm I I'm I think fmer is probably a season keeper for me baring any you know injuries or anything like that so that's why I'm going Palmer I take your point that we both have Brandon John well do you have Brandon Johnson I have medison ironically let let me give you my reasoning so I wanted to go Brandon Johnson but I thought you know CA already has Brand Johnson I don't want to get the same play as CA vital FPL um strategies you know very valid I mean medison has been doing really well the entire season good underlying numbers he his one mill more but I thought my thinking ironically was that medicine's minut should be more secure than Brandon Johnson right Brandon Johnson's a Winger Wingers T to come off they're having a bad game Spurs has options on the wings Madison's creative half of the team should be secure ironically he got taken off first because they felt they need more physical presence in the Midfield even more ironically despite being taken on first he still out Scot BR and Johnson and um solanki so and you know he registered really good stats in that 45 minutes he had a XA of .6 0.6 in just you know half a match and he had six key passes so yeah I don't think this kind of thing will happen often him getting taken off at halim so I'm happy going forward with medison I mean let's be real Sam you're not happy you're just relieved that you escaped with it this week and I'm happy once I looked at the underlying numbers and I thought okay you know I I don't think he'll be taken on too taken off too often and he still is the creative half of the team despite you know the fact that the team scor three once he left okay you sound convinced I don't um but but what I will say is that I don't think uh so the next few games right especially Palace let's just take it as a small sample size I don't think Palace Midfield is anything to worry about I don't see uh post goo taking off Madison because he's scared of Will Hughes right so and and this a guy who hasn't scored since you know a few years ago so who cares um I yeah I don't think this is a concern for you short term longterm maybe different brenon Johnson had the most XG of anybody in the spur team 089 so one of those rare days where BR Johnson actually had a lot of chances and didn't convert not concerned very good minutes very good for his priz bringing it back full circle Sam I don't think the fact that we have another Spurs attacker should have any relevance on psychologically sure but it has no relevance on sun being a good asset but there is psychologically right if you're bringing in a Spur asset you could look at it and say h why don't I just bring in Brandon Johnson instead of sun and save that three Mill for wherever else my team needs it okay um could I not then ask you I this comparison doesn't sound as good but maybe after this week if you won Co Palmer could you not just save 3 million and get Nicholas Jackson that's a good point but I think the the gap between niiko Jack and Palmer is way bigger in terms of Point potential however though I will say I'm very impressed by niik Jack um I think he's going to have a good season I'm starting to warm up to the idea of U bring of him as a f asset but that aside we'll discuss that later there's also the fact that they're both midfielders sa so they take up slots niiko Jack forward KOB Midfield so it's a different comparison it's like Saka and Harvard you know whereas this one is like having both jot and Salah okay okay so do you remember a few weeks back when people are saying you know I don't need Salah L Diaz can cover Salah [Laughter] fa Fair okay I guess that's the question it's debatable but I guess Brandon Johnson is a much safer position because his minutes are much better than Diaz or jot versus Salah so um to your point I guess you can theoretically match sun because you have nailed midfielders who are competing with him as opposed to the local situation where you had non- nail midfielders rotation risks competing against Salah yeah okay so roundabout way uh I see how you can get away without Sun although I'm not looking forward to the next two weeks I guess if you have Solan you keep and if you don't own you're very happy and you're not going to go near him right yeah yeah still sort of figuring out his position in this attack I think uh although a bit unlucky I would say because every single week has been doing really well underlying numbers great you know one of I I I would consider consider this a oneoff week for Brandon Johnson for soan that they didn't return okay on a wider question right because we're talking about forwards and midfielders and premiums and so on uh do you think now is the time you mentioned this earlier we've got so many forward options is now the time to shift back to 343 or whatever any formation that gets you three forwards yeah I think if I'm on a wild cut I would strongly consider it if on a free transfer is a bit hard because that means you need to waste a transfer to bring down one of your forwards to like a bench for and then you know bring it up so it's a bit trickier if you're on free transfers if you have a lot of free transfers if you you know youve kept 10 or five then yeah sure go for it U for the rest of us feels like a bit of a waste of a move you know but I am I really like the forwards right now if I could I would do it I'm I'm really upset with wood for scoring because I I really wanted to take him out this week I won R himz in my team I won but I can't justify taking wood out in his scoring every we can he stop scoring uh it's a nice problem to have Sam um I have zero interest in taking out Chris Wood who as we can see now since Nuno arrived third highest goal scorer in the league and I think the best thing about chriswood is it annoys non- chriswood owners so much like the keep I keep seeing these post he can't keep doing this his numbers are trash this is a bad team how does he keep scoring all these FPL accounts all these content creators who who don't have wood who can't get wood and um it's hard for them but I think it's it's easy for us I could say yeah I mean it's a forward where the team play style really suits him and he's on pants and he's cheap and he's lowly owned so you know I'm not going to lie though I am tempted by the Wolves forwards Matthew uh K and Jacob strand lson the the you know what what hland wishes he could be and then I'm also very tempted by R himz so a lot of good F options in that in that um price braet so you can't go wrong unless you picked domate um kavn so to be fair right there are a lot of FPL podcast that were told you that Cal luin good pick you should go for him four weeks ago we were not one of those people so I hope you remember that you know neither of us have owned Calvin Lin do not own him and every week I see posts about Calvin Lin on the other end of the spectrum very good XG the chances will come uh eventually the goals will come but this is a guy who can't finish any of his chances he's underperformed his XG for a very long time and and surely his his next injury not to wish ill will on anybody but I think it's D Cal L so yeah happy to not own uh and not not at all interested but since as you say that right strand lson Kunia gimenez all you're very interested in so that that's my point right you kind of want three attackers now we're also at a stage where the budget mids slim pickings I think especially at the five to six million bracket compared can I just out just to remind you that um we kind of had this conversation last week as well and you know I said but Morgan Rogers is still doing well and you were like oh no you know just terrible player doesn't deserve to be a professional footballer something like that and I pleaded his case as a non Morgan Rogers owner I pleaded his case to a Morgan Rogers owner I hope you thank me S I hope you you know deep down inside your hey uh I raised my hands up of course slight deflection well not slight significant deflection on his goal but a goal a goal uh assist yesterday in Champions League so my man is doing it uh on all stages and his minutes are inexplicably secure like this this guy just plays every single minute he's he's Aston Villa Saka it makes no sense yeah yeah for price that was my my big point last week like for his price don't you want a player like who can perform like that I mean at 6.5 you would be happy with that you know with hiss no I put my hands up and uh that that brief flotation I had of going for faku bonot who who did point out he did score and still has very good fixtures um so remains I okay to be fair Forest I we we need to go update this FDR Forest not a good fixure so for is not R right yeah but let's talk about some other midfielders Sam and one who I got got a B to pick with you Seb I I noticed a lot of content creators this week are telling me that gacho is the best pick in the game at his price so let me talk to United fan the week I sold him now I maintain I maintain that I've always said since the very first gaming of the Season that gacho is a good pick and the best pick in Manchester United if you want a Manchester United attacker he is the guy you get and do not consider anyone else do not consider Bruno Fernandez kacho however I just was not convinced by United as a whole and I remain unconvinced despite one good game one good half I would say you know I remember unconvinced I still think gachu will will take over because he's the main attacking threat right like he you know he he does everything he's the the only guy taking shots and and things like that now the hland in maybe things are changing right um they do seem better but I just feel there are other players who are less risky so that's why I made the move to medison lost me six points I think but it's okay in the long run I expect SP to score more goals than United um let's let's sort of do a direct comparison because you know we were talking about positions right gacha's 6.2 I think and United's fixtures are West Ham Chelsea Leicester iwi Everton these are on paper good fixtures for a good team I don't know if United's a good team um so comparing but comparing gacho right so gacho 6.2 mid versus BR lson 5.5 kuna 6.3 uh Jimenez 5.7 whist back this week 5.9 now know you going to tell me midfielders versus forwards right but for people like me who have two transfers this is actually a quite critical question this week like do you go with gacho over all the budget forwards no my my take is no because the budget forwards have roots and Alternatives and plan BS if you own calv L you're sick of him you have other options if you own gacha and you don't like him like where do you go your options are pretty limited I agree and I think just even as a whole the other especially real himz right he's my number one he's number one on my wish list I just can't find a way to him this week but can we talk about ress a little bit he has scored like every single game that since he started right in gamei four goal goal goal assist goal um underlying numbers are extremely good you know um xdi of 74 against Villa against City 1.24 against Forest the week before 0.94 the week before that against Newcastle .5 those are great underlying numbers and so cheap 5.7 and pretty good fixture R coming up so Everton brenford Palace woles Spurs Brighton before you know he plays Arsenal and Liverpool back to back Rd jenez come on if you're looking for a budget forward he has to be real himz and I think uh we said this last week he's not on pens I think after this week he has to be on F because Andre Pereira man what that's that's a embarrassing as an effort as you'll ever make and yeah I think Marco Silva has to see sense now R Herz has I think like 36 pens scored in out of 38 something ridiculous he has to take the next one yes so ra himz propaganda go for ra himz I would rate him any player below seven M maybe he would be my Top Choice hard to argue right I'm I'm struggling to think of anybody who's under seven well gacho but you've already made your case clear and I'm inclined to agree with you because uh need to see more from United just so inconsistent right yes West Ham's a good fixture but just need to see more from United I think ask any United fan is the easy fixtures that scar us no yeah and I think uh what Jimenez has uh he's kind of unique right theoretically on pens I'm I'm going to go out and say that which Tran lson won't have you have to pay extra to get to Kunia but Kunia plays a little further back so you kind of want Str Lon but at the same time K actually has better underlying numbers than Str Lon okay not this week in particular but in the previous weeks so I I would if I were to get a woles forward I would pay the extra for K yeah okay fair um but just I the fact that we have so many options right and forward just feels like this is why this is a better slot to sort of play around with um and yeah him him menz uh even yeah wood wood I think the the run is shorter like I think if you already own wood is good but would you get wood now hard to say I think yeah yeah it's just he's just not as sexy as Ro himz you know even the name like Chris Christopher Wood versus R himz what's sounds more exotic I mean fromand man that's that's as far as always it gets and man came back scored against Tahiti scored against Malaysia came back still scored like very consistent it's amazing right chriswood him man has all 30 plus really experienced guys uh just just consistent like you know what you get from them I'm interested in Yan WIA but the only issue is that he's just back from injury like this week uh I wish he was back most of us already have um more and although although we should look at assets individually and not you know coverage doesn't you know it doesn't make sense right it's a fallacy but in my mind I can't argue with the way you know my mind thinks and my mind is thinking I don't want to dou up on a Brandford defense uh Brandford attack it's very fascinating that you feel so strongly because I I know I started the season with Solan son poro like I enjoy I don't know maybe this is a bit of like I'm a bit sick in that where I really want to go all in on a fixture and then you on the other hand are very sort of you know I've got one guy from this good team that's good enough for me let me spread it logic to both approaches but yeah and I think I mean if the fixes are really really great then yeah you know double up triple up sounds nice sounds fun but at the moment because there are so many options I I don't know maybe I'm a bit greedy right it's like a Bo and I want a little bit of every team so I see team up doing well so like okay I don't need WIA although he will be a good asset because they do have a good fixture r i really haveo from the brenford tray let me pick a bit from the Fulham tray taste it a bit yeah I I think the nice thing about himz is first of all a lot of people don't have the ability to get to him like you Sam as you tell me now lot people just don't have a forward slot to spare and lot of people just don't Place him as a priority which feels that always feels like a nice transfer to make like we went in on chriswood a few weeks ago because everybody was not like they had better things to do but we felt likeone was going everyone was going for Kev lein my sympathy is to them although Dwight mcneel has been good I've been really impressed even his assist this week like Twinkle Toes he's left right he beats like four guys very nice assist um and should have had more if calv Leen could finish the amount of chances Cal Leen puts wi is he's just so inconsistent yeah agre okay niik ja uh we mentioned him briefly but I I do like I do like him um so similar price point with solank both uh I think he 7.9 San is 8 point something right but uh nich Jackson I think will be a really good asset this year I'm going to put my hat down and um yeah it doesn't feel so controversial to say at this point I would say like I I'm with you like I think the only thing that's stopping me from niik Jack is I read the next three fixtures of being a little harder than you do I think Newcastle were quite unlucky against Brighton I watched the game and yeah they lost but they had the bulk of the chances and Brighton kind of scored from one of their only chances so I think Newcastle play up to Chelsea and I don't see them getting smashed but yeah dco ja could score uh same United yeah yeah partly is that just the the budget forwards are performing so well so why would you pay 7.9 for forward when you can pay you know for real humanz save like two M which you could use in your Midfield and stuff like that true agree I think yeah there just a lot of value in the budget forwards now uh whether perhaps wasn't at the start of the Season nobody was thinking of strand Lon and he but things change quickly um okay so I that's that's basically all we want to talk about let's let's talk about let me humor you all you non-hand teams I guess there must be more now than they were Captain C this week we've got it here check the chance uh you can follow them on Reddit Twitter so on um so Holland teams you Captain Holland Sam but who are you captaining do you think Phil foran starts this week I don't have have a clue and we have we are recording before the champ we're recording before champions league right so will they make a difference I mean if he doesn't start Champions League you will argue with yourself and say oh that's good so p is saving him for the weekend because they could not create chances until he comes on if he starts the Champions League you go yeah that's good P trust him surely he starts this weekend as well confirmation bias so no no one knows no one knows if pH start which is such a shame I want to believe he starts because they really struggled without you know a proper creator with no KB and no forden they were struggling and um you know their their winning goal came from a foren corner right yeah so I want to believe that for starts yeah but but you don't and that that alone is I mean if you own Forin it's one thing but to bring him in and Captain him I think that's uh no it's just too much it's too much risk and also we have a deadline on Friday so you're not going to get leaks that early so with all that if you yes it could it work yes could you get lucky sure but it's just too it's too much for me and I and I have the slot available to make the transfer I'm not going to even consider it so no not foren I think you you need us you want to be sure your captain please is what I would say and yeah so my captain this week will be Palmer who probably will will be my transfer in from Saka Saka to Palmer Captain P I like it okay all right guess Newcastle has not exactly been great um especially away away I think okay that's that's a bold captaincy but I can't question you you Captain Salah last week and I would not have done that I kep last week I kept Saka the week before so you're on a roll a role with my captain I'm going to say I also captain that one week where he HED in chry so been doing well with the differential captains yeah you're not tempted by emba Captain I guess now he's too mainstream for you is it yeah ownership of 30 I mean not not to say Palmer is not mainstream right but uh I don't know I just like Palmer I got a good feeling about it this week if not not Palmer it would have beeno okay fair enough it's interesting right we we talk so much about Vibes and feelings like I would have assumed Sun would be higher on this chart than Palmer given the fixture Sun versus Palace who haven't you know basically relegation threatened Palace versus pal against Newcastle but I would think you know it's a marginal difference that if I 32 and I think it's probably just home and away right Spurs are playing away Chelsea is playing at home but I guess it also speaks to Palmer's I guess talismanic influence you could call it consistency that in a hard fixture he's this high up the chart like Salah against Arsenal also fairly high up considering the opposition uh I guess Palmer Salah harand are seen by bookies and that there's probably some facts to it I mean there's FPL points that show it they're in one level and then everybody else is the next level agree is that Evan Ferguson is that that is that is Evan Ferguson because Brighton have run out of available forwards Pedro still injured Welbeck stretch it off this week I thought well you know post an update and you know saying he'll be fine and stuff yeah but it's Danny Welbeck and injuries like I I I will not trust anything he says true and Ferguson did start to be fair uh so interesting if he was fit right why can no FPL P just bring it in themselves find it in themselves to recommend very well back he's the second highest forward now you know higher than any of the other people we've discussed right and only like 19 points behind Highland despite being like one third of his price but we just can't seem to be in ourselves to recommend people to buy Dan back I feel really bad because like I've got like friends and stuff who are casuals who do have Danny well back all were thinking about it and then when jao Pedro because they would have asked me and I said no man you nobody gets well back everyone you just don't do that yeah I I again you know not s like this is going to like i s like a really bad person but I was half happy when I read that he was injured I was like thank God he's got to stop scoring which is it because I'm a United fan you're an Arsenal fan we both you know our clubs have both owned Danny back at certain points in his career and so we just don't see the quality whereas if we never watched football before and we're coming in this season fresh I guarantee you we would have recommended well back so it's just bias it's true because see we weren't fans of the clubs chriswood played for we weren't fans of the clubs uh JZ played for I mean we knew them but we didn't have that level of you know not even expertise right but this this idea that you know more you know we've seen Danny welck play we know he's made of biscuits he's going to get injured in in two days time and so therefore we never went for him and yeah it's been kind of stupid because he's been that good and if he's fit this week I'm terrified because he's playing wolves no reason why he doesn't score again um yeah uh a really good pick if you have him and for those of us who don't I guess another week of just crying and hoping he doesn't score yeah okay okay I think nothing else to discuss yeah I think we're good for game Weck nine nine yeah game nine I had to check lost track yeah it's coming very fast yeah so we see you and we will see you next week,9892,9111,as a nonh highland owner i just i i would just take the hit and have faith that its a strategy over a long time period and not a game week you cant just look at a single game week beir you were always very confident that call it confidence call it h i wouldnt say confident after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit im not going to lie but i stuck with the decision and it paid off i pity the people who miss out the halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks this thing hello everyone welcome back to the fbl bangers show my name is sila im joined by sam game week nine preview sam but sam im seeing a lot of initial content this week about how game week eight was worst game week ever disaster i feel i feel like im out of sync with the rest of the fpl community how about you s same saa same saa why saa its because you have a good fpl player as your port mate who convinced you not to make stupid decisions last week like take out muhammad salah i will readily accept that i had you not told me like what are you doing why do you want phil for and he never starts but i almost certainly would have made that move so thank you sir just doing my job saa just doing my job so good week for both of us especially good week for you we had 52 i had 42 both green arrows 52 with 10 players with my second most expensive player my team not starting which is saka and i have all my bench players didnt play not so and to be fair not your bench wasnt like nonplayable you had coner gaves you just you got unlucky but didnt matter in the end it didnt matter they would have given me like one point anyway so its a one point difference and so okay so we both had good weeks and were quite happy and to be fair i think both our seasons are when you look around and shouldnt compared to content creators specifically but just in general right a lot of people are struggling down in the millions so we started off okay were both doing all right that being said sam got to keep going weve kept salah throughout this entire period and as you can see on the screen now salah now the top point scorer what do you think about salah going into this is it is it even difficult run of fixtures not right arsenal is his last hard fixture and is that even fixure right now i think liverpool can score in any game salah can score in any game there is there are hard fixtures for the team yes to come away with a win but i think salah has just proven himself time and time again season after season and like i told you last week he has only blanked twice this entire season in eight games blanked twice and five of those were double digit halls so come on why are you even taking him out and i think its some alignment of stars has happened for salah as well he got in sense that chelsea didnt have kara for far last week arsenal most likely were recording wednesday morning i would say califur is probably not going to play he came off with the injury yesterday so no salah against arsenal against zenchenko is not going to be thats a mismatch zko has barely played all season and then sal also out sorry just to sid trck a video see the interview with z jenko about his training session with pep i did i did tell the people what was it he made one wrong pass pep scolded him for it and hes like i just made one wrong pass and pep very pep like very sarcastically just say okay and then he just ended the training session asked everyone to go in and im pretty sure immediately he went up to the b were selling zenko right now and thats the story of to arsenal passive aggressive but its a bit lets lets talk a bit about arsenal right are you concerned slash are you worried about how things have been going because theyve okay so against lester and southampton you could argue fluke goals but i was very surprised with how bourou turned out stupid decision from celba like you dont give the ref a chance to send you off that early in the game making a tackle like that and so even against shakar last night very leggy just got across the line but coming into arsenals runner fixures doesnt look great we can show you on the screen the here so arsenals next fixtures liverpool newcastle chelsea and then is forest which i think we all agree now is harder fixture than he used to be so with that in mind sideb barring from salah to arsenal assets what do you do with aral assets going into this week i think the only arsenal asset most people have would be saka right and harvit u talking about attackers first right lets lets separate it out so i think i was waiting for the champions league we are recording this on wednesday morning so weve only seen the first round of games i was i think if saka had started i would have kept him in my team but because he didnt start he didnt start last weekend im getting a bit worried so i think this is the week i sell saka very begrudgingly though because when you look at how saka has performed this season hes only blanked once of the seven games hes played right like i think i said this maybe last week or the week before harand and salahs performance at the start of the season distorted peoples perception of what a good fpl asset is what if youre not scoring hat tricks every week then i dont want you but in any other season right you take a player who has only blank once in seven game weeks like thats as good as it gets yes its not sexy its not double digit halls but very good still however with the injuries and with the other options coming up i think this is the week i let go of saka harits though would you would you sell harits i think if you have a cher to spare i would because there are so many options now further down but lets get into forwards later i think lets stick with arsenal first defense though im happy to keep the defense i think because i dont want to make a defensive move i think its tricky lets lets start off with the defense cuz thats the probably the easiest sale to make in terms of in terms of funds it requires and all that your initial instinct is you look at these pictures and think you got to sell all their defenders but weve always said this about arsenal right we said this at the start of season hard fix just where they rise to the occasion and they set out to defend i expect arsal to go against lpool and play for a draw and play for nil i especially if saks out like theres no attacking impetus in the side i would assume the same probably happens at st j spk possibly even at stafford bridge against chelsea so im not in a rush to get rid of defenders i get starting off with dav ryer l i have david ryer you have david ryer as well so look hes a hes a goalkeeper m like there will be a lot of recency bias because sells got 11 points this week ver bren got 10 but keepers are not going to have double digit halls most week so that is a position you dont make a transfer in there unless your keeper has got a sixmonth injury thats it otherwise youve got your keeper youve committed to him unless you have somebody like arola this no reason to make a transfer in that department defenders gabriels still got attacking threat and thats not going to change so not a priority sale but if youre using him to fund moves elsewhere im okay with that because i think weve got a few budget defenders who look interesting now and and so with that in mind lets do that because i think of course youre not going in the order you expect to but i think that makes sense if youre going to sell an arsenal defender who are you going to sell him for okay my number one budget defender which will be one of my transfer st is ryan anuri who i already mentioned last week now w fix just turn this week onwards so and asa has on the screen defenders with the most attacking returns ryan anui at four joined with nathan collins very surprisingly nathan collins but so whos fixtures brighton palace southampton wam bonemouth everton west ham it swit leicester before it starts to turn in game we 18 with united spurs forest newcastle chelsea so then it gets bad get them out then thats a good eight weeks no i cant count its a good r good number of weeks good number of weeks so and hes attacking he plays like a winger right in their formation didnt do particularly well this week against city it is against city but in every other week hes been underlying stats look good underlying numbers looks good ryan ani 44 my first choice budget defender and i should just point out this is a graphic from official fpl so i dont think that lucas dean place for evon still this is were too lazy to make our own graphic so this is what happens when you start boring other peoples content i a very nice pick for me but im surprised you didnt mention someone else sam and i come back here to the fixtures this is fdr tak from reddit as usual and top of the fdr chart is everton and they have a four point come on but they have a 43m attacking defender who you im surprised sam you didnt even mention him r moleno youve got southampton you love michael and what fulham southampton west ham brenford united wolves all decent fixtures brande i think brwi being out has always has been the real issue this season but hes i think almost back to full fitness meanwhile michael keane has turned into karen benzema hes if you havent seen michael keans goal this week against ips which you go and check it out now because that is you could have two keepers there theyre not stopping that finish and 43m for m eno after i said jok merson was a great option last week things happen but surely that cant happen again to m eno i dont know you look at the fixure do you think theyre keeping a clean she against fulham no r himz is just on fire southon maybe west ham although playing bad theyre still scoring every single game branford you think a clean sheet there united wolves i think it looks nicer on paper when you look closely i dont see many clean sheets there for everton i would rather go for brenford defender nathan collins brenford have not kept a clean all season mate but he has attacking trap apparently hes been fluking these assists right you can you look at this and this graphic is like wow collins has four assist but lets we watch the games and even like the most casual person knows i n andan holl very different comparison youre getting nathan collins center back who has been fortunate to get these assists and i come back to brenford fixes okay sure i switch may be a clean i dont think fulhams a clean game for them i dont think bonds a clean sam perhaps what were doing here you dont seem convinced by mel eno im not convinced by branford defenders maybe to your initial point we should probably keep the arsenal defenders because they play for a half decent team and decent teams are the ones that tend to keep cleans and unless you need the money then okay woles defender thatll be my number one choice number two a forest defender that will be my second choice who are decent for fixures and have been keeping some clean sheets so i think they kept their third clean sheet of the season so far which is which is okay and you can get multiple defenders at 45 you could get ola aa you could get milenovic so nia milenovic very tall aial threat sent back from florentina from floren for me in my florentina safe in fm you must be sad about you youll be carrying on that save for another 12 months you must be very annoyed about fm not coming out i know but i sid tracking a bit i dont get fm every year anyway because im i dont know to a new fm i have to start a new team but what about my old my current team havent achieved all i wanted with them yet so thats thats a very positive thats thats what they should instead of tweeting every day with their half apologies thats what they should say now you get to spend another year with your team okay moving forward okay so nica bankovich i like he got the assist against chelsea and hes i think his arrival has definitely youve seen an upturn in forest defense they dont concede from set pieces as nearly as often as they used to lot of improvement there the only thing is forest fixtures as we have them on the screen here leicester west ham decent then its newcastle arsenal city in the next four after that so if you can rotate him maybe although as we say defender rotations arent the best but if you can play somebody else in 12 and 14 and if youre getting two cheap defenders lets say you get rid of gabrielle and you get two 45s you could have maybe an everton defender in 12 and 14 or you could have a i dont know maybe you could have a even a walz defender 12 and 14 thats not too bad but you see if rotation issue i will go for wols defender because great fixtures and even if the fixes doesnt look like cling ry and has so much attacking potential you would just play him anyway so thats why they are my one number one pick and i know a lot of people they look back at the first eight games and like theyve considered like a ungodly amount of goals but again if you look at the fixtures they have not played a single team below the top 10 right so every single team theyve played has been in the top half of theyve only played good teams so that their good run starts now lets see where it goes 45 is worth a risk i think or 44 and i think the city performance is very encouraging they reduce city to almost next to no attacking threat so okay im down with that shut down we got to talk about okay well get to holland in a sec but just wrapping up defenders real quick here just moving up in budget right cuz if youre selling the likes of gabrielle youre going down 5m defenders for me theres only one guy right its kate and you probably dont get konate this week unless youre on wild card but i think next week you get konate and you just park him in your team agreed you do save a lot of money it depends from gabri you save about one mill exactly 63 to 53 so thats thats not nothing and i think pedro poro sam you and i have not been convinced never been convinced and we remain unc unconvinced that pretty much sums it up for federal for and spur defense as a whole i think takes a few good shots youll get your hall eventually but were not interested ask about guardal here yes i was going to come to what do you think so no weve got this on the screen now i did not realize this but its it sounds legit once you start thinking about it since the start of last season no defender scored more goals its now six goals i feel like scoring bangers he had that run like the last 10 games of last season where he just withing every single game he was insane one of those super annoying he cant keep this up and then he kept this up and he ruined your season if you didnt have him i feel like scoring bangers is not sustainable and but some point city have to start keeping clich sheet right this not keep they do but it always starts at the second half of the season i dont know why people keep forgetting about it and i think its recency biased because they end the season so strongly keeping clean sheets winning every single game that in the start of the new season people forget that in the first half they never keep clean sheets before christmas okay so you are comfortable not to have gardio against south apton maybe probably one clean sheet there but im i just feel with the price and everything i rather just get a budget defender at this point and then pump it into the mids and forwards im because i have rico lewis im content to just hold on to that i think for the price im getting what i expected like yes gavs doing well with these shots from 30 yards out but logically that just cant continue and to that point rico lewis is getting into more attacking positions than guardal so bangers aside you just look at their heat map and the play style you would expect rico lewis to return more and he has shown that with assist this season which is which is a good return for a 45 defender when we bought him so i think im content you get what you pay for rico lewis i think the value is there so happy to hold and i think walkers got some injury issues which is also good for lewis i think he seems to have kept his place in the team regardless of what anyone else thinks about whether he is right for that slot so i think thats defense right theres no nobody else to talk about in defense no i dont think so so lets lets i was going to talk about mids but i want to come back to forwards because were on city right lets talk about harand for a bit okay so you must be thrilled because you have i am call it black magic call it i dont know what powers youre using ive captained this guy three weeks in a row for three blanks i told you not the captain this guy for three weeks in a row for his three blanks by the way see and im going to do it for fourth week in a row so at the end of gamei one i was ranked seven mill for going without harand and thanks to his blanks im now 700k so my rank is inversely proportional to hollands performance its interesting right because if he blanks against southampton i think if he does anything less than score two goals i expect people to sell him after southampton like that is the mood now and were all human you just we cant stop ourselves at this point if he blanks against southampton like hes gone gone is that rash dont i dont know he never my theme so now heres the point im just going to say for those people who started the season with hland the logic was not that your player would outscore harland every single week the logic is that over a long enough sample size time period your two players so harand and a versus salah and a better budget player would outscore them and i think so far has shown to be true although i dont know is 10 games are short enough big enough sample size well see now i do i do expect harand to score big this week traditionally he has always scored very big when he plays a promoted side at home right so it doesnt get any better than this if i had i might even triple captain him this week so as a nonland owner i just i would just take the hit and have faith that its a strategy over a long time period and not a game weck you cant just look at a single game weck okay so all fair points my question is the fixtures are they hes its not like as if hes a cell with these fixtures right hes a cell bas on form if we recognize form as a like a thing but after southampton its bnorth brighton spurs in 12 we dont think spurs is a hard defense so maybe 13 right maybe 13 is where you might consider selling your point is that hes not a bad option just full stop and he will score goals but you can rebuild him with the funds that youre saving for money ball money ball and long enough to the season where you now feel confident well to be fair you were always very confident that call it confidence call it h i wouldnt say confident after his three hat tricks in a row or whatever it was my confidence was waving a little bit s im not going to lie but i stuck with the decision and it paid off i pity the people who missed out the halls at the start of the season and then chickened out and went in and got the blanks so thats quite funny i also i dont say i pity them im laughing at them but sure lets lets go with pity okay so i think howand easy its not a question to think about so much this week because no ones selling him before southampton and people like you who dont own are just hoping for the best is what i would assume ive seen some chat about using free hit this week for non holland teams i think thats very shortsighted okay it depends it depends i the reasoning is that your other premium assets like salah is playing arsenal away saka might not play all these other guys dont exactly have the greatest fixture so maybe thats the reasoning however i wouldnt i dont think its worth a for hit in my personal opinion i wouldnt do it ill wait for a bigger opportunity down the road like salah is going to play and could return taka if you just play you sell him youve got alternatives i dont think free hit feels like yes city southampton very good fixture yes you dont have harand youll feel bad but use your funds you can get other players who could still do well this week and i think free hits just too powerful a chip to throw away this early in the season where you dont know what blanks are going to happen you dont know how they will shape out and then youve used a chip for maybe howand gets a brace i dont think a free hit is worth it and for the same reason like that so triple capc is less risky because its its a its a its a youre focusing on harand alone but even then for me triple captain is about vibes and im just not feeling the vibes now so thats the thing there will never be vibes for holland because everyone owns him everyone fair but im prepared im prepared to wait for a dou game where there will be possible vibes and at least ill have a guaranteed fourpointer on my hands times three so i am prepared to wait for that rather than throw it away this early in the season and also in the same way that owning chriswood was nice this week because you got to monday night and you still had you could see like some extra light at the end of the tunnel or youre in my case like this is just going to get better i like having a triple captain c for towards the back end of the season i dont want to throw it away so early fair enough i think okay emotional reasons but if you want stats and other stuff you can go somewhere else this we all about vibes here so on saka you mentioned saka lets talk about other premiums because weve covered harand weve covered salah lets talk about palmer and so kmer where you at it probably be my transfer in this week probably you think newcastle is in good fixture now newcastle is great fixture theyre horrible and i think palmer can return against anyone right like he has that quality he was close against liverpool and i would say the three toughest fixtures in the season is when youre playing away against liverpool away arsenal and away city right im i fif in palmer i think he would do well so palmer in will probably be my transfer this week okay lets lets jump back again were flipping through but lets look at his fixtures right he plays palmer plays newcastle then its man united then its arsenal so thats his next three but arsenal home i which i think makes a big difference honestly in duis fair and ill take your point at pal can probably return against anyone hes got enough roots hes got set pieces hes got pens hes got the ability to shoot it from 30 yards and goes in the only question i have is would you rather have palmer this week or would you rather have sun now its insane that im asking the question because i think a few weeks ago if you asked me would i want son anywhere near my team heck no but i think for us both of us didnt have sun last week i think we got away with one like he on another day he gets that assist right fpl eventually removed the assist for their own goal but on another day they probably just leave that on another day he gets the goal right because he shot it at goal and then he goes in he also hit the post after that and that sun on limited minutes just back from injury spur next three fixtures two of the next three look good they play palace villa ipswitch so palace and ips switch to me seems like a much better combo than palmers next three so whilst i dont think i think suns not been in our thoughts because spurs have been inconsistent but and i think partly also because both of us already have other sp assets like you have brandon johnson i have medicine i brought in last week so to double up im not so sure i think for us but looking in the perspective of someone who has no spur assets i think sun is a very interesting asset hes i dont know why but it feels like hes always been a differential like even every season hes been in the league hes been a differential somehow just gets overlooked and i think its because he tends to return big in one game double digit hall very high ceiling but then goes missing in terms of fpl points he blanks two games three games and then another big hall two games three games so it becomes frustrating for owners so thatll be my warning for anyone who is thinking about going to sun you have to be able to weather the blanks if you want his returns im not strong enough so im going to go for farmer although im not going to say sun is a bad asset right its comparing a good asset with another good asset person i think fmer outscore sun more than so i think the difference is price is about 1 mil right suns 99 palmers 10 eight so i think palmer will outscore him in the long run and im im i think fmer is probably a season keeper for me baring any injuries or anything like that so thats why im going palmer i take your point that we both have brandon john well do you have brandon johnson i have medison ironically let me give you my reasoning so i wanted to go brandon johnson but i thought ca already has brand johnson i dont want to get the same play as ca vital fpl strategies very valid medison has been doing well the entire season good underlying numbers he his one mill more but i thought my thinking ironically was that medicines minut should be more secure than brandon johnson right brandon johnsons a winger wingers t to come off theyre having a bad game spurs has options on the wings madisons creative half of the team should be secure ironically he got taken off first because they felt they need more physical presence in the midfield even more ironically despite being taken on first he still out scot br and johnson and solanki so and he registered good stats in that 45 minutes he had a xa of 6 06 in just half a match and he had six key passes so i dont think this thing will happen often him getting taken off at halim so im happy going forward with medison lets be real sam youre not happy youre just relieved that you escaped with it this week and im happy once i looked at the underlying numbers and i thought okay i dont think hell be taken on too taken off too often and he still is the creative half of the team despite the fact that the team scor three once he left okay you sound convinced i dont but what i will say is that i dont think so the next few games right especially palace lets just take it as a small sample size i dont think palace midfield is anything to worry about i dont see post goo taking off madison because hes scared of will hughes right so and this a guy who hasnt scored since a few years ago so who cares i i dont think this is a concern for you short term longterm maybe different brenon johnson had the most xg of anybody in the spur team 089 so one of those rare days where br johnson had a lot of chances and didnt convert not concerned very good minutes very good for his priz bringing it back full circle sam i dont think the fact that we have another spurs attacker should have any relevance on psychologically sure but it has no relevance on sun being a good asset but there is psychologically right if youre bringing in a spur asset you could look at it and say h why dont i just bring in brandon johnson instead of sun and save that three mill for wherever else my team needs it okay could i not then ask you i this comparison doesnt sound as good but maybe after this week if you won co palmer could you not just save 3m and get nicholas jackson thats a good point but i think the gap between niiko jack and palmer is way bigger in terms of point potential however though i will say im very impressed by niik jack i think hes going to have a good season im starting to warm up to the idea of u bring of him as a f asset but that aside well discuss that later theres also the fact that theyre both midfielders sa so they take up slots niiko jack forward kob midfield so its a different comparison its like saka and harvard whereas this one is like having both jot and salah okay so do you remember a few weeks back when people are saying i dont need salah l diaz can cover salah fa fair okay thats the question its debatable but brandon johnson is a much safer position because his minutes are much better than diaz or jot versus salah so to your point you can theoretically match sun because you have nailed midfielders who are competing with him as opposed to the local situation where you had non nail midfielders rotation risks competing against salah okay so roundabout way i see how you can get away without sun although im not looking forward to the next two weeks if you have solan you keep and if you dont own youre very happy and youre not going to go near him right still figuring out his position in this attack i think although a bit unlucky i would say because every single week has been doing well underlying numbers great one of i would consider this a oneoff week for brandon johnson for soan that they didnt return okay on a wider question right because were talking about forwards and midfielders and premiums and so on do you think now is the time you mentioned this earlier weve got so many forward options is now the time to shift back to 343 or whatever any formation that gets you three forwards i think if im on a wild cut i would strongly consider it if on a free transfer is a bit hard because that means you need to waste a transfer to bring down one of your forwards to like a bench for and then bring it up so its a bit trickier if youre on free transfers if you have a lot of free transfers if you youve kept 10 or five then sure go for it u for the rest of us feels like a bit of a waste of a move but i am i like the forwards right now if i could i would do it im im upset with wood for scoring because i wanted to take him out this week i won r himz in my team i won but i cant justify taking wood out in his scoring every we can he stop scoring its a nice problem to have sam i have zero interest in taking out chris wood who as we can see now since nuno arrived third highest goal scorer in the league and i think the best thing about chriswood is it annoys non chriswood owners so much like the keep i keep seeing these post he cant keep doing this his numbers are trash this is a bad team how does he keep scoring all these fpl accounts all these content creators who dont have wood who cant get wood and its hard for them but i think its its easy for us i could say its a forward where the team play style suits him and hes on pants and hes cheap and hes lowly owned so im not going to lie though i am tempted by the wolves forwards matthew k and jacob strand lson the what hland wishes he could be and then im also very tempted by r himz so a lot of good f options in that in that price braet so you cant go wrong unless you picked domate kavn so to be fair right there are a lot of fpl podcast that were told you that cal luin good pick you should go for him four weeks ago we were not one of those people so i hope you remember that neither of us have owned calvin lin do not own him and every week i see posts about calvin lin on the other end of the spectrum very good xg the chances will come eventually the goals will come but this is a guy who cant finish any of his chances hes underperformed his xg for a very long time and surely his next injury not to wish ill will on anybody but i think its d cal l so happy to not own and not at all interested but since as you say that right strand lson kunia gimenez all youre very interested in so thats my point right you want three attackers now were also at a stage where the budget mids slim pickings i think especially at the five to six million bracket compared can i just out just to remind you that we had this conversation last week as well and i said but morgan rogers is still doing well and you were like no just terrible player doesnt deserve to be a professional footballer something like that and i pleaded his case as a non morgan rogers owner i pleaded his case to a morgan rogers owner i hope you thank me s i hope you deep down inside your hey i raised my hands up of course slight deflection well not slight significant deflection on his goal but a goal a goal assist yesterday in champions league so my man is doing it on all stages and his minutes are inexplicably secure like this guy just plays every single minute hes hes aston villa saka it makes no sense for price that was my big point last week like for his price dont you want a player like who can perform like that at 65 you would be happy with that with hiss no i put my hands up and that brief flotation i had of going for faku bonot who did point out he did score and still has very good fixtures so remains i okay to be fair forest i we need to go update this fdr forest not a good fixure so for is not r right but lets talk about some other midfielders sam and one who i got a b to pick with you seb i noticed a lot of content creators this week are telling me that gacho is the best pick in the game at his price so let me talk to united fan the week i sold him now i maintain i maintain that ive always said since the very first gaming of the season that gacho is a good pick and the best pick in man utd if you want a man utd attacker he is the guy you get and do not consider anyone else do not consider bruno fernandez kacho however i just was not convinced by united as a whole and i remain unconvinced despite one good game one good half i would say i remember unconvinced i still think gachu will take over because hes the main attacking threat right like he he does everything hes the only guy taking shots and things like that now the hland in maybe things are changing right they do seem better but i just feel there are other players who are less risky so thats why i made the move to medison lost me six points i think but its okay in the long run i expect sp to score more goals than united lets lets do a direct comparison because we were talking about positions right gachas 62 i think and uniteds fixtures are west ham chelsea leicester iwi everton these are on paper good fixtures for a good team i dont know if uniteds a good team so comparing but comparing gacho right so gacho 62 mid versus br lson 55 kuna 63 jimenez 57 whist back this week 59 now know you going to tell me midfielders versus forwards right but for people like me who have two transfers this is a quite critical question this week like do you go with gacho over all the budget forwards no my take is no because the budget forwards have roots and alternatives and plan bs if you own calv l youre sick of him you have other options if you own gacha and you dont like him like where do you go your options are pretty limited i agree and i think just even as a whole the other especially real himz right hes my number one hes number one on my wish list i just cant find a way to him this week but can we talk about ress a little bit he has scored like every single game that since he started right in gamei four goal assist goal underlying numbers are extremely good xdi of 74 against villa against city 124 against forest the week before 094 the week before that against newcastle 5 those are great underlying numbers and so cheap 57 and pretty good fixture r coming up so everton brenford palace woles spurs brighton before he plays arsenal and liverpool back to back rd jenez come on if youre looking for a budget forward he has to be real himz and i think we said this last week hes not on pens i think after this week he has to be on f because andre pereira man what thats thats a embarrassing as an effort as youll ever make and i think marco silva has to see sense now r herz has i think like 36 pens scored in out of 38 something ridiculous he has to take the next one yes so ra himz propaganda go for ra himz i would rate him any player below seven m maybe he would be my top choice hard to argue right im im struggling to think of anybody whos under seven well gacho but youve already made your case clear and im inclined to agree with you because need to see more from united just so inconsistent right yes west hams a good fixture but just need to see more from united i think ask any united fan is the easy fixtures that scar us no and i think what jimenez has hes unique right theoretically on pens im im going to go out and say that which tran lson wont have you have to pay extra to get to kunia but kunia plays a little further back so you want str lon but at the same time k has better underlying numbers than str lon okay not this week in particular but in the previous weeks so i would if i were to get a woles forward i would pay the extra for k okay fair but just i the fact that we have so many options right and forward just feels like this is why this is a better slot to play around with and him menz even wood i think the run is shorter like i think if you already own wood is good but would you get wood now hard to say i think its just hes just not as sexy as ro himz even the name like chris christopher wood versus r himz whats sounds more exotic fromand man thats thats as far as always it gets and man came back scored against tahiti scored against malaysia came back still scored like very consistent its amazing right chriswood him man has all 30 plus experienced guys just consistent like what you get from them im interested in yan wia but the only issue is that hes just back from injury like this week i wish he was back most of us already have more and although we should look at assets individually and not coverage doesnt it doesnt make sense right its a fallacy but in my mind i cant argue with the way my mind thinks and my mind is thinking i dont want to dou up on a brandford defense brandford attack its very fascinating that you feel so strongly because i know i started the season with solan son poro like i enjoy i dont know maybe this is a bit of like im a bit sick in that where i want to go all in on a fixture and then you on the other hand are very ive got one guy from this good team thats good enough for me let me spread it logic to both approaches but and i think if the fixes are great then double up triple up sounds nice sounds fun but at the moment because there are so many options i dont know maybe im a bit greedy right its like a bo and i want a little bit of every team so i see team up doing well so like okay i dont need wia although he will be a good asset because they do have a good fixture r i haveo from the brenford tray let me pick a bit from the fulham tray taste it a bit i think the nice thing about himz is first of all a lot of people dont have the ability to get to him like you sam as you tell me now lot people just dont have a forward slot to spare and lot of people just dont place him as a priority which feels that always feels like a nice transfer to make like we went in on chriswood a few weeks ago because everybody was not like they had better things to do but we felt likeone was going everyone was going for kev lein my sympathy is to them although dwight mcneel has been good ive been impressed even his assist this week like twinkle toes hes left right he beats like four guys very nice assist and should have had more if calv leen could finish the amount of chances cal leen puts wi is hes just so inconsistent agre okay niik ja we mentioned him briefly but i do like i do like him so similar price point with solank both i think he 79 san is 8 point something right but nich jackson i think will be a good asset this year im going to put my hat down and it doesnt feel so controversial to say at this point i would say like im with you like i think the only thing thats stopping me from niik jack is i read the next three fixtures of being a little harder than you do i think newcastle were quite unlucky against brighton i watched the game and they lost but they had the bulk of the chances and brighton scored from one of their only chances so i think newcastle play up to chelsea and i dont see them getting smashed but dco ja could score same united partly is that just the budget forwards are performing so well so why would you pay 79 for forward when you can pay for real humanz save like two m which you could use in your midfield and stuff like that true agree i think there just a lot of value in the budget forwards now whether perhaps wasnt at the start of the season nobody was thinking of strand lon and he but things change quickly okay so i thats thats all we want to talk about lets lets talk about let me humor you all you nonhand teams there must be more now than they were captain c this week weve got it here check the chance you can follow them on reddit twitter so on so holland teams you captain holland sam but who are you captaining do you think phil foran starts this week i dont have a clue and we have we are recording before the champ were recording before champions league right so will they make a difference if he doesnt start champions league you will argue with yourself and say thats good so p is saving him for the weekend because they could not create chances until he comes on if he starts the champions league you go thats good p trust him surely he starts this weekend as well confirmation bias so no one knows no one knows if ph start which is such a shame i want to believe he starts because they struggled without a proper creator with no kb and no forden they were struggling and their winning goal came from a foren corner right so i want to believe that for starts but you dont and that alone is if you own forin its one thing but to bring him in and captain him i think thats no its just too much its too much risk and also we have a deadline on friday so youre not going to get leaks that early so with all that if you yes it could it work yes could you get lucky sure but its just too its too much for me and i and i have the slot available to make the transfer im not going to even consider it so no not foren i think you need us you want to be sure your captain please is what i would say and so my captain this week will be palmer who probably will be my transfer in from saka to palmer captain p i like it okay all right guess newcastle has not exactly been great especially away i think okay thats thats a bold captaincy but i cant question you captain salah last week and i would not have done that i kep last week i kept saka the week before so youre on a roll a role with my captain im going to say i also captain that one week where he hed in chry so been doing well with the differential captains youre not tempted by emba captain now hes too mainstream for you is it ownership of 30 not to say palmer is not mainstream right but i dont know i just like palmer i got a good feeling about it this week if not palmer it would have beeno okay fair enough its interesting right we talk so much about vibes and feelings like i would have assumed sun would be higher on this chart than palmer given the fixture sun versus palace who havent relegation threatened palace versus pal against newcastle but i would think its a marginal difference that if i 32 and i think its probably just home and away right spurs are playing away chelsea is playing at home but it also speaks to palmers talismanic influence you could call it consistency that in a hard fixture hes this high up the chart like salah against arsenal also fairly high up considering the opposition palmer salah harand are seen by bookies and that theres probably some facts to it theres fpl points that show it theyre in one level and then everybody else is the next level agree is that evan ferguson is that is that is evan ferguson because brighton have run out of available forwards pedro still injured welbeck stretch it off this week i thought well post an update and saying hell be fine and stuff but its danny welbeck and injuries like i will not trust anything he says true and ferguson did start to be fair so interesting if he was fit right why can no fpl p just bring it in themselves find it in themselves to recommend very well back hes the second highest forward now higher than any of the other people weve discussed right and only like 19 points behind highland despite being like one third of his price but we just cant seem to be in ourselves to recommend people to buy dan back i feel bad because like ive got like friends and stuff who are casuals who do have danny well back all were thinking about it and then when jao pedro because they would have asked me and i said no man you nobody gets well back everyone you just dont do that i again not s like this is going to like i s like a bad person but i was half happy when i read that he was injured i was like thank god hes got to stop scoring which is it because im a united fan youre an arsenal fan we both our clubs have both owned danny back at certain points in his career and so we just dont see the quality whereas if we never watched football before and were coming in this season fresh i guarantee you we would have recommended well back so its just bias its true because see we werent fans of the clubs chriswood played for we werent fans of the clubs jz played for we knew them but we didnt have that level of not even expertise right but this idea that more weve seen danny welck play we know hes made of biscuits hes going to get injured in two days time and so therefore we never went for him and its been stupid because hes been that good and if hes fit this week im terrified because hes playing wolves no reason why he doesnt score again a good pick if you have him and for those of us who dont another week of just crying and hoping he doesnt score okay i think nothing else to discuss i think were good for game weck nine game nine i had to check lost track its coming very fast so we see you and we will see you next week

blackbox ahead of gameweek nine take two how are you Mr Andy mode you right I'm not too bad mate yeah is it is still lagging or are we all right no no we're good I think that's it I tried quite an optimistic setting the resolution to 4K and I think that might be the reason why things were as great as they were um but hello to to everyone I'm sorry that Mr Mark sus isn't here but it's great to see you you and if you're your first black boox of the Season isn't it it is indeed it's the first black box of the Season yeah um I've missed it it's been a while I don't know the last time I was on I know obviously my favorite one was when we were roasting your wild car but I think that was a little while back now that was a Friday night mid midseason wasn't it wasn't it you know the exact Before Christmas yeah probably burned into my into my mind luckily my season started a little bit better this time so it's not quite as uh as as bad has it been have you found the season so far you you been enjoying it uh it's not been too bad I I've I've had a little bit of a struggle so far this season usually I'm a little bit higher than this but it's been I I've made a few moves a little too early and that sometimes hurt me and I seem to have avoided the Liverpool midfielder points i' I've owned three of them and seem to have owned them all at the wrong times but it's it's picking up a little bit now got a green arrow this week so hopefully that can carry on and the team's looking all right so fingers crossed yeah it's I think this is the first time I've streamed with you for a while where you've been ahead of me actually which doesn't feel very nice I mean it was heading in the direction of it was going to be my highest rank for about 18 months but red this week after so many uh so like so many people it was a it was a it was a strange game week and we've you know we've got quite a lot to talk about we only have you for about 45 minutes because then you've got a yes a delivery coming which which is a supermarket of choice that's that's the key question is i' love to say like I'd love to say like okado or something like that but it's not no it's it's just tesos Tesco okay I thought you were a sous man but Tesco is is fine um yeah so we got we got lots to cover we're going to talk about um all the different stats marks on some great tables for us even though he's not here here we got our teams uh to cover uh and depending on how long Andy's around for um we've got predictions and everything else if Andy goes I I'll stay around for a bit and yeah answer some question and and things like that uh we do have a sponsor um for this week's episode and this is of course manscaped you are watching two bearded men on the screen right now I have the uh I don't know if you knew that that manscape do beard trimmers do you Andy as well as as well as The Bull Shavers I didn't know that no tell me more there you go well they do they do uh so I I use the manscape beer trimmer which which is great because we go for the more kind of longer longer beard uh look they've actually just bought out a brand new product called the chairman Pro which is for people who basically want an electric beard trimmer but want to go a bit closer to the skin so this is where the Five O'Clock Somewhere comes from you want a five o'clock shadow don't there's a video of it as well where the guy's doing it and it's it's a little bit it's a little bit suspect but it's called the chairman Pro great new product it's got two kind of interchangeable heads that are magnetic so you can go for your stubble look or your clean shaven uh look pair it with your your beard trim if you want to grow it a bit longer you can pair it with your ball shaver if you want to have your Fresh Balls as well you can use it in the shower um and yeah it's it's another great bit of Kit from from manscape so Christmas is coming up if you're looking to treat yourself if you're looking for a gift

and use our code blackbox for 20% off before we get into game weeks and all of that stuff I think we have to cover the big talking point of the week and I know you've briefly spoken about it already um on the scow cast but it is this whole sack content creator cartel there's already comments about the cartel in the chat that I'm I'm seeing I mean what's your take on on sacka gate there was a lot of last minute moves from sacka to son to foden um you know from popular people within the community do you think there was anything untoward going on no we certainly didn't get any bloody news did we no I know and and I said this to you before we streamed is that if you're getting news and not telling me I'm not not going to be very happy so I'm pretty sure there is nothing going on behind the scenes I think it was just a lot of good managers making a good move sacka was not 100% Going to play and a lot of people wanted to move him on the next week anyway and I think that's just what they did they basically jumped on two assets that they thought could do quite well this week and had nice fixtures moving forward which was foden and son I kept sacka myself I moved havs out uh I kept sacka and obviously keeping sacka meant I got minkovich off the bench so actually actually worked okay for me I know jamm a little bit but actually I didn't move sacar out because I knew I had minkovich first on the bench and I think those people that had a good bench or a good person that could in there was less of a risk as those players that maybe didn't I can I can see why they made the move I want to move sacker out this week it was always my plan and if I thought he was definitely going to be out or I thought I need to move him out to get another player in I I see it as a good move personally so I do also think as well people keep forgetting that these managers could have like two three four transfers in the bank at the moment so like moving a player out like that there's less risk I feel doing it when you've got lots of transfers so I don't think there's anything going on personally and if it is I'm not privy to it uh so I'd be very surprised I mean you OB but there's there's nothing going on is there as my God I mean I'm getting I'm getting called out as as part of one of the people that that sold him you know with 20 minutes of the headline um and I you know you know what happened to me I got got by Bloody boer's tweet when he was impersonating that Arsenal and who sent you that list ah and obviously in the Godfather's chat bloody Mark Southerns shares it and he's been caught out before like that and I clicked on it and my normal check is just go over I was thinking of selling him anyway so I was looking for any excuse I click on the link he sends I check the subscriber numbers 20K I look through the previous tweets and they all look legit and that's what boa did really smartly if you could call it that this time is that he kind of created a bit of a pre Loop because normally it's just inject emojis you know and you're like oh okay clearly that's that's bua this time he done the ground workor and yeah it just it completely got me so I looked at that transferred sacker out went back to the group chat and someone said oh that's that's Boer Mark um and it was it was too late and that's normally the kind of thing that that catches you out and then obviously sacka didn't play foden was benched he came off and got the assist it was a real roller coaster Andy I'm not going to lie yeah um but yeah ultimately it was the right decision because I had dibling for a sub but yeah yeah it surprised me how many people had forgotten who bua was because obviously hasn't done anything for a little while and then all of a sudden I had people in chats going who's who's bua who's this bua why why do you all know that this is fake and as soon as there was an extra letter in the Charles wats thing I was like I know this is fake but the fact you actually did the sacka move because of it I thought I was absolutely brilliant and the fact Mark sent it to you as well but you brought foden in so it didn't turn out that badly did it no and obviously the two players that people were bringing in were were son and foden and both of them got some points for the owners and I think that's what kind of sha a bit more of a lens on it because had they both blanks I don't think people will care I just think I I I can I thought all week saaka would would play and it was only when I saw the team arriving at the stadium and he wasn't in any of the pictures and then we had the old Andy Martin thing of him going to the stadium and he's all of that was was just was just brilliant um but you know I was probably going to sell him this week anyway and because it was like 50/50 at that point I just thought you know what I'm gonna do it a week early and and and bring him in and SK says yeah getting buono in is a good cover story I love that as if I'd make that up to make myself look like that much of an idiot yeah what I love someone else in the chat has put um we know you two aren't getting leaks because look at your ranks it's like yeah if we were getting leaks You' really think I'd be 1.7 million at the moment oh I've told this story before I told it to you earlier but the the only the only leak I've ever had genuinely was last season someone messaged me I I spoke to a fair bit on Twitter and said just heard liento playing like today and he was in my team and I had him benched and I was like do you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna risk it I'm gonna play him off the back of that benched was complete rubbish it's the only leak I've I've ever had um yeah it's it is a funny one I mean what I did this poll and I just thought you know there's a lot of like PE there's a lot of people like trigger lips has done videos on it and Al's done videos on it and there's lots of people calling into question like the Integrity of content creators and I just thought out of the general Twitter lot so this is a sample of like 2,800 people if there was this secret WhatsApp group this cartel group that people think there is well some people think there is um you know which gets team leaks you're allowed to be in it but you're not allowed to ever share them and if if you ever share them you you're booted out immediately how many people would join it 76 % said they would join that League I love that so yeah I know it's people give it all the high Mighty and I think that 24% at least half of those would would would still you know would would do it really yeah I know and to be fair I said to you before the stream when you showed me these results the thing is there are some people out there that wouldn't join it because they're already part of it so you got to take that into account as well but but um I if if you offered somebody that opportunity of course they do it but I think as soon as you've got a certain amount of followers and I don't know how many it is specifically as soon as you got a certain amount of followers it's seen as is wrong if you do get leaks and things like that but you look at the biggest guy out there which is let's talk fbl he gets the leaks and he shares them all every single one he gets his shares so I don't really know what people want to be perfectly honest but I think it's F I don't think there really is anything going on that we don't really know most of the time no I think it's a shame with because Andy gets a lot of the brunt of it because kind of the biggest account and you know people say is he doing it for clout on his deadline streams but you know Andy doesn't build his deadline streams as being this is where you're going to get the leagues people turn up because he might get them and he has a list of of people that he trust that sometimes they in those leagues before but he always shares them with with people so I don't really know why he why he gets some of the stick that he does in this regard don't know I think people just attack people that are they've got a big following BAS I think and it's unfortunate but obviously that's where you get the most interaction sometimes so people wouldn't be doing it if they were just shouting into the void they want to make sure people interact back with them and that's obviously what they want half the time I guess um which that's what Twitter is isn't it yeah it's uh not been the best place over the last last week or so um hopefully it starts to pick up a bit and we can start having some nice chats again but yeah it's it's not not being the best place anyway let's talk some FPL uh stuff just quickly cover my team this week uh it was a bit of a disaster 33 points I'm sure a lot of people can sympathize with that Raya Trent Gabrielle Lewis and Davis all blanked in defense foden came in he got the assist from the corner in the 90th minute Four Points uh inom o to Rogers actually came in last minute for dibling who I'd been saying I was going to play all week and then I just suddenly went why am I playing as Southampton player let's just get Rogers back in uh so Rogers got the got the goal uh booked again though it always seems to get booked when he when he scores which is annoying yeah uh Harland with four Watkins did well for me with eight and salanki has been really disappointing with two and I benched Moreno who got six on my bench he would have been quite a nice differential but yeah a bit of a bit of a me game W best we just move on right yeah yeah let's just move on from this one we can move on to Mr Mark Southern's team actually managed to have a o worse worst with he got 26 uh I think fleen was his I know Rogers was his highest scorer but fleen was up there with four uh Trent CBA with minus three Lewis with two Gabrielle with one seeno Rogers and bumo F and harand salanki so a pretty similar team to to mine obviously had had celba with minus what did you make of the celba red card how do you think that's going to affect Arsenal going forward I think it is I I think on scoutcast the other day we did um a little bit of an analysis on Arsenal and it shows that they are already conceding more chances than they were most of last season and they're not putting up as much XG I think the odard injury is a massive difference I think he is such a controller of the ball in their Midfield and I think these have been a massive Miss I do also think they've played a lot of their games with with 10 men which obviously hasn't helped their XGC this season either and their disciplinary record is is shocking compared to the rest of the season it's compared to the rest of the teams I don't know what's happen like they wanted them to be kind of tougher and they're doing that by getting red cards all the time um which obviously isn't great for their assets and cbra celebra managers the people that went celebra and Gabrielle or CRA and Rya and went for that double Aral defense have been punished quite brutally to be perfectly honest and minus three from CBA is is you know that is brutal so yeah I think I think it is going to I think he's only going to miss one game isn't he but I think Arsenal double defense especially with their fixtures moving forward I think I'd be moving off one personally and when you got a player like say 8 Nori or someone like that who could be good you know especially from next week onwards I think I'd probably make the move myself yeah I mean I I it is a one match ban the commentators on the match definitely said it was a three- match ban and I went back and listened to it again and they said three matches but it's not violent play right so it's just a one match match that's how I thought it was yeah just one game yeah fine um so he's back for Newcastle and and Chelsea but obviously misses the the Liverpool game um so yeah not not ideal for Mark he's already made a couple of of transfers I'll talk about those um in a bit your team though absolutely flying 40 points oh coming up trumps mate it it wasn't looking that good uh I obviously I had I had Rogers as well who didn't do too badly I was absolutely gutted salanki got nothing um I was out I was out in town when it was happening I was every goal that went in I was thinking San's got to be involved and every time he wasn't involved so I was absolutely Gutt about that yeah but the big one was that those Forest players on the Monday night and obviously having word who could have had a hat-trick like he looked good again like he hit the post he had a few sitters that he missed and then milinkovic as well um milinkovic who I got in on wild card and I was kind of eyeing up some of these nice fixtures Palace we were talking beforeand and we put cells in our uh Strictly Come captain in um selections Palace honestly that all they do is just pepper goalkeepers from outside the box and they can't finish to say their low so that any keeper against him it looks absolutely brilliant to play him and obviously Sals got an 11 pointer in the end so the people that were waiting on say a SS and a wood for Monday night um got you know help themselves to 18 points but yeah they saved me massively so I was on about a 500K red arrow until Monday night and then I ended up getting a green arrow of about 100K so yeah I will very much take it can you remember the last time a Monday night game actually delivered for people it's been a while it has been a while um it used to quite I swear the one that sticks in my mind I'm pretty sure Hazard played against West H yeah and got um and got a brace or a hat trick or something wasn't it and he absolutely killed it on a Monday night I remember that quite vividly but if that's the last one I remember then that says a lot that's about eight years ago wasn't it eight years normally it's like you've got one or two players left on the Monday night and you you think right they can save my game week they can they can really do something for me and then you watch the clean sheet get wiped out after like 10 minutes and then player gets subed at 65 and you're like get up my whole Monday night for this but that was a good one for forest forest you know owners um it went it went well are you playing linkovich this week against Lisa I'm not he's first on my bench I think uh or second on my bench I can't actually remember now but yeah he's not in my team currently okay I've got Moreno so he is in my in my team at the moment uh this is the Great and the good obviously she've been added to this after um not usurping what's the word beating beating grayhead last year that was the punishment that he he faced you coming into this I'm top of the three of us somehow uh 785k which puts me fourth which is pretty surprising just below pra one point behind prz seven points behind Harry had an awful week again with with 26 prz and Harry both well praz Harry and Mark all with 26 uh pretty pretty remarkable Ben Kellin though 54 points with his son captain thing is we're looking at him as smashing it and he's only 300K like you know there are other people out there that are like already in the top 100K like hibo is obviously around the 100K Mark and I think it's absolutely mad that he's I feel like he's played really well recently Ben but like I said he's only 300K I expected him to be way more than that and that's after a almost 350k Green Arrow so yeah it's been it's been tough so far in this league I would say and I looked at my overall Rank and thought God I'm going to be bottom half of this easily so to be top half I think it says a lot about the kind of start of the season but we got to remember as well that it's very rare that we've had triple Captain be played quite as much as it has been so far obviously that's been played a lot so maybe that's t a little bit to be taken into account because all those that played Highland obviously got um 17 extra points so maybe that's skewing things a little bit but yeah it's been tough 300 KB in the top and most of us over one mil is is yeah not usual yeah I think it's been the Relentless form of as well I think you know quite a few people didn't start with him at the beginning like myself few a lot of people sold him on wild cards in in maybe gameing five or six and he's carried on doing really well you know two two double digit Halles in his last couple of game weeks so yeah if if you had if you had sellah you've been you've been doing well BL says it's the Bad and the worse good name good name for this league um I have to say um yeah Seb is is really struggling he's he's down 4.8 4.8 million obviously not doing the the Scout cast riew this season and just seems to love banking those transfers that's what does it that's what does it see you leave the Scout cast and it all goes to part no he's um I think I saw his his team value is like 99.5 as well like he's really like you said he's kept hold of those transfers and I don't think it's helped him yet but I'm hoping that he kind of has a couple good weeks and he starts storming on up but he's only what just under 50 points behind me and that's three million rank so he he'll make that up hold I thought yeah there's there's there's really not much in it between between a really good rank a respectable Rank and even a poor rank at this stage so yeah don't panic uh Don't Panic too much uh let's take a look at some stats this is team data uh defense and Liverpool are at the top of this they have we I think we all know that they're the best defends given from what we've seen which is obviously one of the major things that slot's bought in uh in his kind of brief tenure Villa a second interestingly not really a team that I trust particularly um but .89 um you know is is good obviously quite tough fixtures uh to come let's talk about Man City though I mean I've got Lewis I every week they just seem to concede it's really frustrating yeah I find with this team data defense stuff that like you've got Liverpool there okay they they seem like the you know the best defense at the moment but is it any other defense that you trust at the moment I mean funly enough forest was one that a lot of us you know kind of put a bit of put a bit of money into because that their data did look good and obviously they got the cheap options Lewis at least is cheap like we're not paying for gardol or something like that although he obviously turned into Prime Roberto Carlos at the weekend but I do think Forest I do think Forest are good Liverpool's an interesting one for me still they do look really good but their fixture run has been the best it could possibly be really up until now so the fact that their fixtures are changing now if they start keeping clean sheets and having this good a Daya against teams like Arsenal Villa City like then we can start really taking them seriously but I there's not a lot I mean I was thinking about this with goalkeepers there's not a lot of goalkeepers I fancy moving forward either but there's an awful lot of fixtures that are changing soon so if you've got those High upside Defenders like anate Nori or something like that I've already mentioned them anyway their fixtures change you dramatically moving forward brentford's are looking really good moving forward Brighton's look good after a while like all of a sudden you're looking at a few different teams and it's just based on fixtures really but I I think forest and Liverpool look the two best defenses I've seen so far Villa's interesting though because I thought Villa might struggle with with their whole you know playing in Europe this year but they've killed it in Europe and they seem to not be having too much of a hangover after after the games either so fair play to them um it's Arsenal's the biggest one for me it has been a bit of a drop off but do you think a lot of that is because of the the red cards or do you think something quite dramatic has changed this year yeah well I think I think it's it it doesn't help does it when you've had three red cards in in eight games um it's it's going to skew the the statistics a bit I mean against Leicester it was just two freak you know worldly goals from from James Justin not much you can do about that um I wonder if and James made this point last week that maybe they they do switch off a little bit against some of the the teams they kind of expect to beat because they've got so much of the ball because they're so in control you know if you're two it up maybe do just take your eye off the prize a little bit and I think we saw that in the first game against wolves wolves should have scored in in that match Villa was a tough game next but again I think Watkins miss an absolute sitter in that game so yeah I don't think it's it's really surprising that maybe they haven't hit the heights that we we thought given given that kind of start but at the same time no clean against Leicester Southampton and Bournemouth I know is is a concern especially when you go into the run that they're going on to now with Liverpool Newcastle and and then Chelsea um are you are you doubled up you doubled up on on Arsenal defense I'm not so I was going to and then we weren't sure whether Ry was going to play so I brought flein in and went with havitz havitz got me two goals in two weeks I was quite happy with that and now I've moved on from hav to salanki so no I wasn't and I think those people that went for double Arsenal defense it was the floor play it was the I'm expecting some clean sheets in this run which was a good decision but it's like I said it's been it's been paid off in the in the worst way really especially with the celba red card kind of yeah really rounding it off for a lot of managers there so I do think we've got to look at the data we're seeing at the moment and think that Arsenal aren't the elite defense we thought they were but Liverpool's the one that's most interesting to me in terms of maybe not a Trent because obviously he's expensive we got to try and get those premium mids but when you've got players like canate who look good good and kellerer who could potentially be in goal until December with reports that are coming out like they're not the worst players to potentially to invest in but I do want to see how they get on against an Arsenal and a villa and a city in the next five yeah I mean I'm I am doubled up on on Arsenal um I've got Gabrielle bench this week because obviously I can't bench bench re haven't got a backup obviously benching Gabrielle is a is a risky move given the given his his threat from from set pieces but I do want if we are going to see people pivoting to a double Liverpool defense because I know obviously there's there's jotter there's Diaz um there's Salah there's Trent there's you know there's there are decent picks there but if you're not going for Salah I can see why people aren't going for one of Josh oraz given the fact that they get benched and there's kind of rotation um around that obviously J's now got this little injury so I wonder if maybe it's it's Trent canate and then you leave the third spot open for for Salah I wonder if we're going to see people doing that when the pictures turn I'd be very surprised I'd be really really surprised if people went double Liverpool I mean I'd be surprised if people are even got one at the moment unless it's Trent and even then the majority of people I know that have Trent are thinking of selling him because he's just that cash cow that you need to move to those premium mids so I'd be very surprised I mean the fixtures I wouldn't say are really there the Brighton game's not too bad but Brighton can attack so I'm looking at those fixtures and thinking I don't think now is the time to be moving to it from 15 onwards yeah there's there's a case for it but I I would be very very surprised I think people are going to be moving off defense quite quickly and they're going to be pumping their money into Midfield because that's where it all is and we're going to get to a time from kind of 12 onwards when we're wanting sacka we're wanting son we're wanting um fod uh Palmer we're wanting you know all that Harland still potentially and I think I just don't see it personally I think we're kind of going back into the old days of make your defense as cheap as possible and pump everything into Midfield and Strikers which it did wouldn't it that's exactly what it used to be 4.5 million Defenders across the board so we'll see do have Trent well that's what I mean do you think Trent's going to be the sacrifice for this yeah I think so I I think it's just too easy a sacrifice to make in terms of you free up like three million by moving down from him and I and I think that's the the biggest thing that people are going to do and when you've got players like I said like eight Nori or I don't know mikeno that you can down to and they got nice fixtures I think people will do it yeah other end of the table the obvious ones I switch a bottom I think no surprises there Southampton and then Leicester all in and around two expected goals conceded every game clearly the teams to to Target Chelsea down in 17th I knew their defense had been bad but it has been really bad according to the stats yeah yeah it's interesting that one I mean the three at the bottom of the three you'd expect and obviously they've got some we've got some players with nice fixtures against them this week in in brenford and we've got um Man City obviously as well chelse is an interesting one and actually I think a lot of people didn't go for Sanchez because they thought he was going to lose his place but I don't hate the idea of Sanchez because they do concede a little bit of XGC if that makes sense but I would love to see how much his what's that stat was it XG prevented or something isn't it XGC prevented for Keepers I'd love to see where he is on that because he always looks he's got a cler in him but oh Andy let me let me let me get that up for you right now there you go at this there you [Laughter] go uh actually it is oh xgp is there uh it's yeah um it's one's four so it's not great yeah yeah well he's he's four for points per 90 um one is one ranks about one of one of the lowest um on on show I think Ray rayer and Leno actually the two lowest oh and pford actually pi at 2.3 Leno at 2.4 yeah no it's an interesting that obviously the two Liverpool boys being top if if we find out Allison is out for a little bit longer kellaher is going to be extremely popular um but yeah Onan is always going to be up there because we can see so many chances as well um but no I I was interested to see where Sanchez was on this but I don't think that it's it's tough with Chelsea because the fixtures aren't there for quite a while are they really you'd be looking to move in maybe 12 or 13 and again if you've got a a keeper that's is doing fine you're not going to be moving for one are you no I mean just just to just to kind of reiterate what this what this chart showing so um expected goal prevented just basically indicates how I think I I think it's the best metric of how well a goalkeeper's been performing um this season uh you can see Hanson is there at the top at 4.6 he's basically prevented nearly five goals with some of the saves that he's made Pope there at 3.1 Anana had a great start to the season uh 3.3 you wouldn't expect to see Rea in the minus so he's actually he's actually let in more goals than than he should have done um you know give what we seen from the Champions League when he's saving penalties and rebounds and and all that kind of thing um you know it's you wouldn't expect to see see it kind of reversed Allison at 2.7 so yeah there there's been some Keepers that have had strong starts the season basically very very very interesting though that fen's bottom one well not bottom but he's bottom of this list and minus 1.70 but he's got more save points than anybody else this season hasn't he yep he's made 42 saves and next best is Pope with oh no next best is Hanson with 40 and then it's Pope with 35 so that's quite interesting but um yeah obviously fen's also got the fixtures coming up you know I switch Bournemouth Leicester at home and he's got two nice away fixtures you'd be hoping for something in that run I would have thought yep uh let's look at some attacking data don't know if you like me I I think I probably trust the attacking data more than I trust the defensive data especially when you see teams like City and Villa at the top when what I see is is teams that can sort of play play quite well against them apart from obviously in the Champions League they're doing really well um Spurs are a topic that we're going to talk about bit more this episode I've got a table on some of their assets and they are top actually non 90 expect to score two goals a game with Chelsea second 1.86 and Man City just off that um 1.85 but Spurs players we've both got slanky how are you feeling about how are you feeling about that uh I mean he's going to be in and around the attack the thing that um is really interesting at the moment and I was listening to the above average pod and they were saying the same thing is that he seems to be doing that firmino role like firmino used to do for Liverpool where he does a lot of the work to make sure that the Wingers obviously get what they need to do and Madison kisi Brennan Johnson son seem to be thriving because they've got that Striker up front and you think they've had te o Vera richison and people like that for a little while since Kane's left and I think is what they've needed they've needed that player that's a bit selfless and will do that not great for FPL nobody ever really picked forino he did have those weeks where he did really well I think sank will still be fine but I think if you've got sank and he's your only attacking Spurs asset I think you probably want to try and get another one especially for you know this little run that they've got as well and the fact they in 11 and 13 they've got two Captain all fixtures my biggest thing is which one do you go for because I think if you were set me up so perfectly I know I know because look at this because son is the one that seems to be the explosive player that we've we've you know had an FPL before and he's the one that can hit those Heights and get you the braces hat tricks whatever it's going to be Brennan Johnson seems to be getting a ridiculous amount of chances inside the box and touches inside the box which it shows here but I've got such a soft spot for koseski like I I think he's creating so well at the moment but is he Captain a ball I I don't think he is so all roads kind of lead to son Madison the big thing this week was that he got taken off at halftime he was playing really well but they needed to change things and he was the one that went so I think all roads lead to on personally unless you need a cheaper option then I think you probably just go Brennan because the value is there interesting I see I think all roads lead to Brennan um with this I mean touch touches in the Box 64 um for for Brenan Johnson um interesting keski isn't isn't far off that with with 62 so you know having like 10 touches in the Box um a match essentially um I haven't fact checked this Mark Southern sent me he did also send me boer's um tweet to take it with a pinch of soul but he told me brenan's touches in the box is identical to harland's in terms of her so you think about parlan's position his average position and where he just stands or Johnson is getting that many touches in the box from from out from out wide yeah I know I I mean Brennan looks looks nailed now doesn't he I think he's going to be playing every game for them moving forward kisi I think is as well son we we've been told by Andre already that he's going to be managed this season he can't be playing every single game 90 minutes he's got to be managed a bit more so you would think that raras and verer are going to be coming on for son and maybe verer coming on for salanki so that koseski role I think I think between koseski and Brennan I think they're fine and they're obviously an awful lot cheaper as well I do have a soft spot for Koski but I just think son is there and he's the one you'd want to captain in 11 and 13 would you Captain Brennan Johnson in 11 and 11 in 11 or 13 against ipswitch will F him no I wouldn't but I'm not looking at I'm not really looking at alternative captains other than other than Harland at the moment I think if I think if Holland wasn't in the picture it would it might be it might be a bit different um who's Holland got in in third who City got in 13 is that the Brighton game city of Liverpool away oh okay yeah so you so you probably do need an extra Captain let's get the um let's get the ticker up hang on uh yeah so in 13 City have Liverpool obviously you've got that great Spurs game against Fulham I'm looking at Chelsea Chelsea with Villa at home that's not too bad either Arsenal with West Ham away I don't know would I rather have son than saaka or Palmer that's the thing that I keep coming back to I I just don't think I would yeah sacka is the one because I think sacka by the time you get to 12 if he's fit again which will most likely happen you're looking at sacka in 12 back because you're going to want to be getting on some of those Arsenal assets again potentially but I mean Palmer if you don't own Palmer now when do you think is the entry point when do you think I need to get him back in for that game you is the Leer one in 12 you have you have to get him in 12 don't you so if you're getting Lester if you're getting him in 12 and you need son for 13 because he looks the best captaincy option or a or Spurs when how are you going to own all these players by by well I I don't I don't think son I don't think son is is needed that I've said this from the start of the season it's it's probably going to come back and bite me when son's ends up to the top scorer in FPL or something like that but if I'm looking at son compared to saaka Palmer Salah Harland he's the fifth one for me out of those he's the one I'm I'm picking last and the Fulham game isn't it's not like Southampton at home or rip switch at home you know he's got him in 11 Harland has has Brighton where he will get chances against us believe me um so do I need to get do I need to get some full at home when when Palmer's got Villa at home I don't mind that for for Palmer and then Palmer's got him switching South Antony for side I think Palmer's got to be a mustone from 12 isn't he yeah I the more you look at it as well he's obviously in 12 he's got Leicester in 14 he's got Southampton the big thing for me with Palmer now is like and I mentioned this on scoutcast about five weeks ago is that he's one of the only players that can go really big anymore like I don't really when you look at other players and you think Harland obviously can Salah still has it in him but he's slowed down a little bit compared to what he used to be sacka doesn't massively go big I know he has what twice but you wouldn't expect it in a game week whereas Palmer against the right oppos position just goes mental and he's not playing in Europe I just think when you're looking at those fixtures it's not like you have to look and say yeah but he's he might play midweek he's not going to so I feel like Palmer from 12 is you know a musthave really so it's just when the rest of them come in but like you just said if you swerve son and you go for a koseski or a Brennan Johnson it means you can get on a sacker and a Palmer quite easily in 12 I guess the alternative is I mean you've got you've got J Johnson compared to um to son there about 3 million saving there you could go Jackson over Palmer there's going to be what a 4 million saving there no let's stop you could do I mean or you go havs over sacka right and that's that's your 1.5 million million saving I mean I was going to ask you which of those you think is actually a decent a decent tradeoff um I'm guessing it's not it's not Jackson it's not it's not either I don't think I don't think I want either over them um oh as as gone hello is it just me what's happened has as disappeared I have no idea whether it's just me hello I'm assuming this is just me I'm waiting for him to come back in rip as just you Andy cartel got him he mentioned too much oh he's back again do you know what this is one good thing though about streamyard is awful is is what I've learned from this this whole experience has been not because of you because we're having to wait we have to pause between each bloody thing so we can we can speak they were just talking to me it was lovely but at least one of us can like leave and come back in it doesn't kill the whole stream yeah true yeah yeah um yeah I was I was just saying uh you know if we are looking to save some money like where where can you go I mean foden to harland's the other one isn't it do you ever think foden is going to be a replacement for him no not at the moment no and I mean we we talked to Luke quite a bit and he's saying like there I we don't see a time at the moment where foden's going to be nailed on because that he's not going to play him on the wings and that Midfield three with gundan is obviously where he wants to go and he seems really scared of teams playing in Counterattack so it it doesn't look like there's going to be a fixture where you can say foden's definitely going to play even this week and I don't think foden's a good buy this week because a lot of people with foden are probably going to be moving off him in a couple of weeks so it's tough and it's a shame because you want them but I don't really feel like there's over a longer period of time I don't feel like you can compromise on sacka Palmer and Harland I just don't think you can whereas son could be one you compromise on um but yeah the others I just don't think they are of course they're all on penalties as well which is such a major factor too yeah I mean I've got I've got foden probably until gameweek 12 and then and then I'm probably going to be losing him for for Palmer in some way losing foden before Spurs at home though doesn't feel amazingly you know amazingly good if he play but that's the thing I mean you think that's going to be a case all season do you think foden's going to be a doubt All Season or you reckon he's eventually going to be straight he's going to be number one it's a shame I think he is I thought kdb being out I thought that kind of nailed him on but I think with rodri being out and gundan coming in and the fact that he's quite scared of that Midfield not really being secure enough against teams he seems to keep picking gundan who I don't think has been great since he's come back either and I I think it just means that foden ends up being the player that doesn't play and uh what Savio is great at the uh last night and so is Matas Nunes as well and I just think foden's being turned into little bit of a scapegoat and kind of not getting the minutes we're expecting and coupled with the fact that he's had a bit of an injury too it's meant that unfortunately one of those kind of explosive players from last year we're now having second outs about and it's not like we haven't got other options like I said you got saaka palas son and that's just naming three of them and then you've also got players like inmo so all of a sudden it just becomes foden is a bit more dispensable this season than he was last season it's got kind of mahrez Vibes hasn't it like when we all kind of thought mahrez was going to be first name on the team sheet when he'd been playing really well literally week after week after week he gets he gets benched I mean Mar has never won play of the Season like like foden did last year and it does seem surprising that he's potentially going that way but he has had history with pet before La last season was the blip for foden really because he he played pretty much every game before they yeah I know I know um and to be honest I thought that was it then but I think things have changed I think the rodri injury did shock it did shake them quite a lot as well you know to lose him for the whole season I think is massive for them um and I just think I've always said obviously with foden last year he was playing every game so it was absolutely fine and when Harland didn't play or De Bron didn't play he was he was another focal point which is awesome as well but I just think this year he's turned into a player that we're having doubts about every week and you don't want to invest in too many players you're having doubts about every week and like I said there's alternative so yeah I'll be getting rid of him for Palmer most likely yeah not this week obviously it'd be 12 yeah we're all saying that because Mark's in in the chat with ar and he's saying he doesn't feel confident about phone and kind of regrets buying him and wants to move elsewhere all three of us have got him and we're all feeling kind of same way but and remember as well we've got fent and Lewis so it's it's every week you're looking thinking if both of those are benched like that's a massive hit to your team and the upside hasn't been there yet so that's the other issue like but you know hopefully when he does play and if he plays this week we could be absolutely loving life and obviously he scored in champ league as well so we'll see what happens but he's not as certain as he was last year that's for sure yeah we've got a little bit sidetracked just to come back to the Spurs assets table I saw a question asking us to kind of rank these in order just to just for the podcast listeners um son comes out top on terms of points per per 90 7.1 and he's mentioned kazi's assist potential he's the highest on show out of Som brell and kvi Madison and sanki uh 3.4 pretty much Brennan's the one who's getting those shots away getting the shots in the Box he's having those touches um all in the area as well um slanky is having the best chances if you look at XG per shot non penalty 0.26 that's the highest so when he is getting an opportunity it's the highest XG um shot and he has had the most big chances as well with eight compared to Brenan six so he so sinki is still there I mean I'm not like you say when I watch him I'm kind of not that impressed but the stats don't make me think think he's an awful option I just think Brennan is probably the one I if you could offer me those if you offer me the swap for free I think I'd probably take you up on it yeah i' it's really interesed that though like salanki I think is fine because he's obviously that Striker position and when you're looking at Strikers I think Harland salanki wood seems to be the ideal three at the moment in terms of fixtures looking forward and form and things like that but that Midfield slot I think is actually quite tough son it's basically I'm fighting in the back of my head with keep it simple and simple as son because I can afford son and that's just keeping it simple he's the goal scorer but I do think Brennan and koseski at that discount you it can't be ignored basically and I do get what you're saying with Brennan Johnson I've just got this thing in my head that Brennan Johnson is g to revert to type soon but as kfy i' I've owned koseski before and he's done well but again he's got his issues where he's not really a goal scorer so I think I'll probably end up with son but Kulu is the one in the back of my head but are you going to Bren this week or are you is this just the one you'd pick if you could no I'm not actually um my my transfer yeah well I be interested to get your your take on on my transfer because I'm I'm doing these match of the day notes on on Twitter and you know the reason for that is I want to give myself a reason to watch match today because I I didn't watch it religiously last year and I had my worst ever season and I think I was watching a lot of live football but I think sometimes it's nice to get a bit more of a broader overview of what's of what's going on and I think match to day is really helpful because obviously they break down the tactics and you see you know players that you might not otherwise have seen or mentioned and I have to say the the player that I've been really impressed with um for a little while and particularly I thought against brenford was your was your mate garnacho oh your boy I thought he was unb I think he had eight shots in in that game uh against brenford I just think he's taken it a bit personally being benched in those first few few matches and there's always question marks around Manchester United and whether tar can get them you know playing any brand of football that doesn't rely on kind of individual Brilliance but he is a hell of a player isn't he gacho and the fixtures I mean again we're going to come back to the fixtures um graphic but the next five for Manchester United West Ham Chelsea Leicester IP switch Everton four of those five games against four of the weakest teams in the league well five if you include Chelsea's defensive you see exact so I there's been so many false dorms with United and it happens every season every season we got oh hang on they've started looking good again I will say that front three of rashford gacho and holand did look really really good and I think holand is the one that we've missed because xerx is not that type of player yeah I do think that looked really really good Bruno that assist was absolutely beautiful by the way and if anybody else did that we'd be talking about it for ages but I do think na would be the one to own especially if he continues to play on the left and I think for the fixtures we've got coming up especially after this week I think West Ham's fine but the fact that we've then got um Leicester at home Everton at home and we got I switch away I think they are investable in but it's who are you buying him instead of and if you're buying him instead of a Spurs asset I don't think I'd do that I think I'd want a piece of that Spurs pie basically and then I think you could probably wait until 11 basically because I don't think you'd invest ahead of Chelsea even though their XGC is so low I don't think you would so I think you'd probably be waiting till 11 but from 11 onwards I think a gun at is not that bad we could even see a rashford Resurgence which you know he was about 80% owned at one point after Co wasn't he so um yeah I've just I'm used to this with United there's been so many false Dawns and you think you're getting in there early and you just end up going at the wrong time so yeah but garache would be the one I think yeah I mean I've already got salanki I mean I could double up on it as a SP I mean that's what Mark's doing he's got slanky he's already moved for for Johnson he's going one step further and buying a player we haven't even mentioned from Spurs which is porro as well bringing in por yeah bringing in por this this week so he's going really hard um on Spurs I think I'm gonna I'm gonna pivot away from it and and have a bit of a punt on gacho I had him last season I kind of feel like he owes me I benched him for for two braces last season yes I remember that yeah which uh he was cheap as chips last year wasn't he he was was he he's five million was I think I got at 49 something like that and again it's really stupid but playing a 49 asset feels rough playing a 6.2 asset feels a bit better even though it's the same player uh it's just kind of how how a feel Works um this is a new graph that um graph chart that that marks put together this is so the this is um game we nine xgi of course game week eight xgi so this is um xgi just for the game week and I think again this this goes quite nicely with like talking about match of the day and highlights and what you see from individual game weeks obviously we we look at the stats we look at like a longterm View and you know last six game weeks is typically what we look at also can we to see who were the kind of the the top um performers in in individual game week um I mentioned gacho's shots he's not in the top 30 that I could see for xgi non- penalty so they weren't exactly great chances but he was having a lot of them Brenan not though I wanted to talk about playing for Leicester he's at the top of this 1.5 I was really impressed with him um this week haven't been since he signed for Leicester he he's looked all right for briyan when I've seen him play he's come with a big reputation I think TZ said he was going to be the next liel Messi which is little bit of hype to to live up to um hasn't really delivered I don't think Brighton ever really knew what his best position was tried to put him on the right hasn't really got the pace for that we had a lot of players who could play in the 10 um but yeah really really delivering at at Leicester um yeah what your thoughts on him yeah I don't hate him at all I think he's he's playing all right I think um Leicester fixtures what they got Forest not great potentially but then ipswitch and then from 13 onwards it looks a little bit Rosier so I don't hate him as a pick I you know I play so rare I've got him in that and he's absolutely killed it in that in the last couple of weeks so I'm very happy there it's just I think we've got other players that are cheap options to say like are you basically going to go with a bonon not or are you going to go with a Rogers I think is the the comparison because you're not going to want more than won midfielder at 5 million um and obviously Rogers has been the absolute bargain so far this season and I think stop it stop it I'm not too I'm not totally sure about that I think that I think can well I mean if you we look at some of the players on this list Midfield is around five million so you've got Buon not okay he's probably not too many people going there but I think he's a he's a decent option um seeno is on here at 56 two rough games fixtures on exactly two rough games but you get through those and then it's it's a decent run um do you think Smith row is now just not not a consideration for us at F I'm I mentioned that so on scoutcast two weeks ago hibbo and um uh nacho were saying oh Smith row is still a good and I was thinking I don't know whether he is anymore I I I I would much rather have a Rogers over him um I'd much rather have a bonon not potentially although like I said the fixtures maybe aren't there enough for me but I I still think Rogers is the one if I was wild card and Rogers would be on it 100% and then you've got Patrick Flor saying no mcneel I think McNeil's an option at 56 with the fixures they've got I love McNeil AB Rutter at Brighton yeah is Welbeck still out well um Herzel has said that he it sounded really painful he said he'd like knocked a nerve in his back or something like that and he was still in quite a lot of pain I'd be very very surprised if he um if he started against walls um Ferguson played 60 minutes I'm not sure he's got a bit of a knock as well but it it could be rter up front if if Ferguson and Welbeck are both out we might see rter up top not sure who'll then play at the 10 maybe gruda comes in at 10 um or they push like a bber up to to that role but yeah I think Rutter's looking like you know we paid 40 billion for him it raised a lot of eyebrows he's looking like a good player for us do you know um the one player I'm going to mention and this is my like my differential I think he's like 3% owned oh is uh is dams guard for brenford he's on set piece is he's looked good he's got three assists in his last two games I think he's someone especially with their fixtures coming up as well what they got IP switch Bournemouth Lester all at home you could you're gonna be wanting to play him potentially I think if you could have a double up with him and aumo and then have those three premiums I I quite like that so damar's my little uh one he's not actually on this is he but he's um he's one that I'm gonna tip moving forward okay okay well um in the sleeper draft the wire have got Dam's guard and I know I know zal was was talking up on on the video they did today so I think they probably agree agree with you on that um two more players I wanted to mention on this list I mean one of them you own already Chris Wood 0.91 seven points um for him gimenez Ral gimenez 5.7 million next 0.74 if we jump ahead and we come to the the forwards um table um both are uh where are they on this list so where wood is 17th I saw them earlier wood is 17th and Jimenez I don't think is Jimenez is eighth on this say .63 for him um and and wood at .39 I mean Wood's expected gold per 90 is pretty low isn't it at .39 that's the first thing I saw I mean 78% accuracy and 31% conversion surely that's not sustainable surely I think he looked good he could have got more on Monday night I I genuinely I think he is he is such a good option if I was wild card in this week I am almost certain I would have Chris Wood in my team if I was wild card in after this week I might move to somebody else maybe like a CA or Al Larson because I think they might start coming into teams with wolves's fixtures obviously changing and I think there's going to be a bit of an uptick there but I think Wood's fine I feel I feel like if you've got wood now he um if you've got wood now you're going to keep him and you're going to be more than happy with the fact that you've got him but if you don't he is going to be the player that you do not move to every week and he's just going to keep it there's always a striker like this always a striker I swear every season that does this and he's just going to be that one where people are like no he won't carry it on and he'll just keep plooding away I reckon it's funny is it because at start of the Season everyone's saying not only is he is he not GNA is he not going to do that well but he's not going to play because alanai is going to come back and you know take his place that I mean that has just been put completely to B Nuno really likes him I think he really likes what he brings the side and he's almost built I mean it's a prettyy exciting attack with Hudson Ado Gibs white and elanga but it's all about yeah I mean Anderson was Unreal yeah absolutely unreal so it's like a like a man City Light you know instead of Harland up top they've got chriswood Christ is this just you trying to bring mark back next week saying all the lovely things about him I wood has been Mark Mark has got it wrong about wood he was pretty pretty anti- him in the start of the season and uh yeah I think he he always thought that Tyra would have eventually come back and and take him but yeah hasn't done so um I we're on borrow time with you now we're we're six minutes past eight you've got a a Tesco delivery arriving any minute it'll be coming any minute mate bit of I know it's like this it's all the track can talk about but it'll be here in a minute I would have thought well before let's um there's still some stuff I can cover obviously I can I can carry on when when you're gone um but let's Jump Ahead quickly just to your team for the week in case you do have to jump out I'm sure people will be desperate to know what your what your plans are al they can watch them on the Scout cast I doubt they've changed uh too much but yeah this is your team read out for the the podcast thiss and tell us what you're what you're thinking yeah so I got flecken in goal IP switch at home uh Gabrielle Pedro porro uh Rico Lewis foden and bumo uh Rogers sacka who is yellow flagged at the moment and then salanki Harland and wood up top with Harland as my captain minkovich first on my bench seeno and Greaves don't know where that injury came from but Greaves is out for about four weeks unfortunately and valdar s's my on the bench um I am pretty happy with this team this week I think this team looks fine this week I've already got that triple up with with City I've got double up with brenford which is in buan fleen but you know it's a pretty good fixture there my main move I'm looking at this week is sacka out um and it will be for a Spurs mid it's just which mid I go for basically I think I'll just end up going son but I am very very tempted to save the money and then move from foden up to Palmer got money in the bank so I've got 1.7 in the bank uh so I can move sacka to anybody I could even go to Palmer now if I wanted to but I think I will go for a Spurs mid it's just which one I go for basically but your voice then I know I don't know what happened SPS mid um but the one thing I will say is I don't really want to move down from sacka and then spread the funds I want to keep those price points because I want those two premiums in Midfield so I don't want to mess it around too much but sacka will most probably be going out I I have no idea whether he's going to play this week and even if he does I don't expect a lot from Arsenal in that fixture I think that is as tough a fixture as it's going to get for them so yeah I'm pretty sure that's what I'm going to do it's between son and koseski I think sorry because you and Mark are both going to be trebled on on Spurs and that just isn't really something that I would would consider I I don't fully trust them I know their attacks been good but they went down against against West Ham they've you know they threw away a two- goal lead against us they were awful in the second half against Leicester in in the first game they seem to have really good spells and they're not so good spells they're not they're not a very reliable team for for a triple up on potentially but then they were top of the XGC they were top of XG on your table and I look at it and just think with those two fixtures coming up in 11 and 13 to have that triple Spurs and potentially the captain one of them as well those are the kind of games where you can get massive games and I just think yeah why not go for a triple up Captain one of them and if it hits you're flying and I think that's the kind of thing I quite like at the moment I've done it with City I went early on foden which actually I'm quite happy I did because otherwise I'd be second guessing whether to go for him now so the fact I've got triple City this week this is the week where I'm hoping to you know hit big with them as well so I think you can do that every now and again and this is what I've wanted to do so I'm pretty sure I'm going to do it okay no man united players for a good run you Faith oh yes maybe maybe a gun out show but I I it's tough moving him in with all those other players I want yeah uh I'll show you my team the the order of this this stream has gone completely out out of the window technical issues stream out the window you're off to do a s a Tesco delivery yeah it's all it's all Carnage uh this is my team uh it's raying goal with Trent Lewis and and Moreno I'm playing him tomorrow uh against against Lester away foden and bumo seeno Rogers Harland Watkins and sanki up top Ward Gabrielle Davis and dibling on the bench yeah I mean I I could do smeno to Johnson I've got the money to do it but I think I'm going to take the punt on garnacho as I said I like it just something a bit different I think he's like eight% owned something like that um I remind you this in two weeks yeah I know I know and all the people on these yeah all these people the on the video as hat United he's never going to bring in United player and all that it's like yeah well that'll shut you up when I have one in my team would it I'm play every are you going to are you going to wait till the last minute and get the lead before you get gacha in or are you yeah I'll see what comes through in the cartel WhatsApp group and you know make make the decision on on that I will be hoping for a leak on Moreno because you know there's always a chance he could miss out for I'm assuming my request to join the cartel is still pending on the pending pending yeah you're not you're not actually a patreon member yet so that's true give us your give us your eight quid a month whatever it is and then you can cool I see what I can do um big question though Andy the big question that we haven't even covered yet and it doesn't show it on this graphic but it is currently active on my actual FPL team triple Captain any any consideration for it no no literally none at all no I I I I just don't think I would ever play it in a single game week just really don't think I would I the fixture is there and obviously the people that did it against dip switch and you got the hattick 17 points times three lovely but double game week you you know you only have to get a goal in each game and Max bonus and and you're beating that so I I will not be doing it this week and I I would be absolutely shocked if I did it in a single game week in any season I don't even know what the double game weeks are going to be but it could be that I don't go with harl it could be I put it on Salah could be I put it on someone else you know Palmer potentially so no I I 100% won't be doing it but little birdie tells me you might be I'm about I'm 6040 in favor of of playing it I'm I'm I'm a bit annoyed with myself I didn't play you know on him against IP switch because obviously Mark and I did the match of day challenge Mark didn't own Harland it would have been fun to have gone into that challenge with him with all triple Captain I did have it on him very briefly and then I took it off and I thought it's a bit too early for that like game week was it game week three um was it game week two was game week two wasn't it against against Z switch I just thought that was a little bit early um my reasoning for thinking about it now is that I've seen Southampton play and I I I I can't remember too many teams who play as badly in defense as as they've done I mean it's it's the perfect blend of you know a manager who isn't changing his um philosophy and in some ways you know fair enough that's how they got promoted he doesn't want to change but do you need to adapt a little bit to to the Premier League well it doesn't look like Martin's done that at all is individual mistakes from The Defenders and it's just an overall real lack of quality in that Southampton team yeah like ramale was a good signing for them you know he he's not a a bottom three goalkeeper obviously but that defense that Midfield the fact they've not really got any like out ball to a to a stri and I know they've got Archer but you almost want them to have a big man up top that they could you know at least a leave bit pressure and win the ball high up and hold it up they don't really seem to have that I just don't know how it can happen that City don't score multiple goals against them at the weekend what's your um expectation on minutes by the way my uh my the door's just gone so I've gotta go that's it you're GNA go pleasure as always thank you guys I had a I had a message lined up for that and he needs to go put his Petty Fu away this is the first time I've ever done a a proper episode of ffi Black Box um on my own and obviously I did the team selections last season but haven't actually done them on my own so yeah I thought I could just carry on for a little bit I've got a couple more charts go through the predictions um can answer some questions and things that that people might have obviously it's just me if you don't like listening to me then probably best you you drop off um because I'm G to watch the the numbers go go down crazily but yeah if you if you want to stick around and you know we can we could do another half an hour or so um then then let's go for it uh I do need another beer though should I grab that now should grab that in a bit not too sure anyway uh let's carry on for for a little bit more uh let's talk about some of the other um tables that we've that we've got so let's go through the main one so this is Defenders over the season you saw on my team earlier that I had Leaf Davis at the uh in the starting 11 he's actually third for exped gold 90 at .24 the question marks are around who's going to score the chances that he's he creating he's very much a creator of chances uh you know shots per 90 when you compare that to to Trent is half you to porro two it's a lot a lot lower than that um but the the Chan he creating is is really high 2.5 is the highest it's now higher than Trent um I think he was second going into into the league obviously Trent had a had a difficult game um but um yeah Davis is is creating chances a reasonable rate there's just no one that can really um has grab the bill we right yeah we'll do okay I do do Defender tables then I'll go grab grab a beer um so yeah I do like Davis I just don't know and Mark said this on the video he did early in the week the let's walk fbl um is it enough you know to be creating chances when there's not really anyone who can who can put them away and I think we've spoken about fors we've spoken about himz and kuna and stran Larson I think dap was big flavor of the month going into the Everton game and now it's it's massively gone down um to to some of the others so yeah we we'll see kind of how we switch bounce back from you know pretty bad losses I mean to lose that heavily to West Ham and then to lose to Everton in that manner um I think McKenna is going to be worried you they come out of a bad run they want to start getting points on the board um and then it's a bit of an issue so yeah he's he's still in my team but I don't think I'm gon to be playing him for the um for theable um I mentioned porro marks bringing him in uh this week you know nine goals conceded is obviously the problem he hasn't really had the attacking returns he got that goalen game week one not anything else yet I thought L really impressive in the West Ham game getting full um a lot I do wonder if Brennan cutting in means porro goes out a bit wider uh means that he's not really getting as close to goal as he maybe was last season um but you know he's still getting chance he's still getting opportun he had that shot near the end which was absolutely awful but it was from kind of the right the right kind of area uh so yeah I think he's he's a decent option I mean this week I I play I played Davis over Moreno and I I do wonder if it is like a clean sheet first policy that we kind of need to adapt with Defenders I think particularly this season when the bonus doesn't really favor attacking Defenders the bonus really does favor the clean sheets um you clean sheet for a Defender you know we sort of I think it was Murillo Sals um did AA get a bonus in that in that Forest game maybe maybe not um but yeah it's the you know it's taking multiple attacking returns almost for Defenders to get something uh from it so yeah a bit of a bit of a concern I'm not I'm not totally sold on on PO I think five5 is a bit too much for him but yeah if you've got him I hold him I don't think I'd be I'll be buying him is there any else on this list that really inspires um I'm not totally sure there is I think minkovich is a good shout if you've got him he's 20th on this list um he has an assist I think he got that the week before last um I think he's he's probably the the stand out in in that in that bracket I don't mind Anor either but those fullbacks don't really seem to be getting forward a lot too much so I think milinkovic would be the one if you're looking to tap into to Forest nor 13 two goals two assists not point2 exra P maybe expecting that to be a little bit higher given the attacking returns that he's got maybe suggest that he's been a little bit lucky uh but I think he's gonna be pretty popular obviously Brighton are gonna thrash him this this week so don't buy him yet but going forward the the fixures are pretty decent um for them couple more that we flagged here we got Manning at Southampton um you know climbing up kind of the thing look at his Chan to created for 90 in the top 10 that's why we're featuring him uh vanderberg in 4 not sure what happens with Rico Henry when he's back but 4 million I think vanderberg is probably the one to go for and you got moleno really popular seven points and from himly Keane got the got the big hole but mikeno didn't do B mikeno didn't do badly 89th on the list though it doesn't really look like you're going to get much from these Everton Defenders so you've really got to hope for those one nil wins that we know D is is capable of um but again if you got him at 4 five he he's probably a bit of a keep so there's some decent option defense there's no one that really kind of I don't think anyone's really a mustone you know Trent and Gabrielle obious got the tough fixtures um Lewis is a hold but isn't really getting the clean clean sheets I think his minutes are pretty safe I think Walker's uh kind of being phased out a little bit um maybe it's a bit of a shame that Stones has made a bit of resurgence because he can obviously play uh kind of in in that kind of inverted role but I'm hoping that Lewis Lewis carries on um vel's 18th going to pay a little bit more for him two goals in the last couple of games he's obviously a good pick as well but no one really you know I think we we said this a lot last season um about Defenders not really having too many standouts I think we're kind of getting that again uh this year so when I've got Trent um who have I got I've got Trent Gabrielle they're okay I've got Lewis I'm reasonably happy with I've got Moreno I mean that could be any not KN Forest Defender I'm pretty happy with those going forward so yeah not not looking to make any defensive moves uh in the in the near future um right I'm going to grab a beer I'm going to stick the stting soon back on um no technical issues I'm hoping at this stage it's a bit annoying with Andy we're a little bit delayed so thanks for for sticking around um a couple of people have left with it just me but still 770 people watching uh again we're caring for about another half an hour or so so I'm going to grab a beer and I will see you all in about five minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] I am back and what is better than one beer sure you know the answer oh it's two beers there we go thanks for sticking around everyone still 700 people watching this which is amazing if you uh I know it's a Thursday night but if you fancy grabbing a alcoholic or a non-alcoholic drink and joining me as we just rattle through the rest of these tables that'd be great Andy is is obviously getting his his Tesco delivery um and then he has got his community thing where he does that kind of educational uh I'd like to think it's like a seminar that he does so yeah if you're if you've enjoyed listening to Andy tonight he's always great to have on on standby for these things um then yeah check out his his community and get involved in that right let's have a look at the mids to cheeky hazy James absolutely I don't like brog as a company you know there's all the kind of problems the owner has had in the past and uh yeah I'm I'm not a big fan of how they how they operate but unfortunately they do make a pretty decent beer and I'm a bit of a sellout so yeah that's where that's where we're at uh right let's look at midfielders Jak's shaking in the background he all right it's fine midfielders then so I mentioned garnacho um he doesn't really feature well um on on the the list for the the last the last we show which was on the the XG for the game week um he's showing up highly though on here he's 13th on the list .57 X non penalty for 90 I always say around 0.6 is your kind of like Elite uh Elite numbers if you if you've got a player who's consistently getting around 0.6x non for 90 I said that that puts him in a pretty good position when you consider the fact he's 6.2 million um as well I think that's really nice inter that is identical to seeno who I would be selling for him the amount of shots seeno has um is is crazy um he does have some from from outside the air I think he's had the most shots of all midfielders which isn't kind of shown on on this on this table but in terms of those shots in the Box for 90 2.97 um ranks him to just below Salah 2.98 look at BR though 3.88 that's the highest of all of all midfielders but yeah garnacho 2.69 decent touches in the Box per 90 7.37 for him that's higher than S think just making some hacking nois in the background that's nice I've Disturbed he was fast asleeping so went and got these um got these beers uh so yeah it maybe feels a little bit sideways doing that doing that seeno toono move it's Villa away next for Simo then it's Man City I think he could get some joy in those I really don't think you know selling is is a if you were going to keep him I wouldn't say it's a terrible move let's put it that way I'm just trying to tap into those slightly better fixures for for and he's a player that I just genuinely really like and I'm not seeing him many teams so there's a few reasons there um to get rid of him um Savio is fifth on this list I think he's an interesting one as well if you are looking to go for someone a bit different in the Man City attack um I thought he played brilliantly in the Champions League uh last night he's looked good in the games that I've I've seen him play obviously he was amazing for Jona last year that's why city of the ball I don't think we've seen that kind of player from him in terms of that kind of output if you look at some of these numbers look at those touches in the Box per 90 uh 9.92 that's kind of in the top five for midfielders the ex 9 is really high as I mentioned .71 um and yeah I wonder when his that that right hand spot of the city team really does feel up for grabs and he's clearly got hell of a lot of talent so I think it's going to be sooner rather than later we see him see him break in the trouble is do you weigh or do you take a punt on it for this Southampton game I think again he's someone that's that's flying under the radar he might even be some I was considering but I'm I'm already tripled up with Lewis foden and and Harland um someone to consider malison SATs a great on in .85 EX on 90 but Andy mentioned his early sub I think that's a bit of a concern when the players going off halftime uh poo KLU said they weren't really controlling the game which is rare for him to to say that I think he's said in the past that he doesn't care about how much they control it as long as they they score goals and get the win but they need to do something to get a handle on that West Ham game and it was definitely that sub that that changed things around um and and KF kind of impact that he had I think after that sub was was made so I think he he's now a bit too risky and obviously we've already talked about the the Spurs players um I still think Johnson is the one to go for um but I don't blame people for for going for son because we know what his pedigree is like it's just that it's just that sanky role we give him a couple of weeks s does but if he's blanked again in the next couple he's going to be someone that we that we look to take out um I don't think it's fair to talk about midfielders though without talking about Morgan Rogers at 5 million at the start of the Season he's not showing up on these stats you know you have to go down to 4 first to find him .38 he's not in the top 10 for touching the Box he's not in the top 10 for chances created his points per 90 is 4.47 it's decent but it's not kind of crazy this is where I think watching games having a bit of you know making sure you're watching different teams not just your team when they're they're on TV um and using the eye test is is really clear because Rogers to me is is looking like he could be one of the if he made team of the season the way he's playing at the moment um I don't think anyone would be would be too surprised he is so key to everything Aston Villa are trying to build whether it's in Europe and he was I think he was man of the match in in the game the other night um every game I've seen him play he's demanding the ball he's making the runs his end product is maybe lacking a little bit and I think if he starts adding those goals to his game what is his potential um you know for five Milli he's never going to be a Palmer we're never going to have a Palmer again I don't think at five million um but if Rogers goes on and could get you know 170 180 points and really kick on from where he is now he's goingon to go down as one of the best value picks of all time and I think that's more likely that trajectory for him um than you know he gets phased out and doesn't really become a an impact for us so if you're listening to this and you haven't got Rogers um you're always going to have kind of other priorities maybe to go for you know the big hitters and the moving around but when it comes to saving money and you want to bring some money out of maybe some of the other other midfielders even if the pictures aren't that good I still would suggest that you you take a look at Rogers um because yeah I I just think he's he's he's an absolutely unreal player and and I wonder how long it's goingon to be to gets caught up for England um I mean surely he's got to be T's got to be looking at that and thinking he's a player that can offer us something a little bit different because if you think about de Bry for City and the way he can get the ball in Midfield and just drive forward um we need more players like that in the in the England squad um from that kind of central role that maybe hunt foden because foden has never delivered for England so yeah Rogers had to had to mention him the other player I wanted to mention here just move on is um Fatu as well of Leicester thought he changed the game when he came on um against Southampton um I know Harry's got madidi he's I saw his his his podcast where he was kind of wondering why he's he's got him I don't think he was a bad pick at all I was tempted to go there kind of at the start of the Season obviously there's now other five five five options who are looking a bit better um but you know with Jamie vardy with madidi and with fatua they've got some real players that can hurt teams um and again he's not one you're gonna buy now but I think he's he's someone to watch because he's got that kind of explosiveness in him where over this run of games Lester have got once we see him naed in that team I do wonder if he could present a bit of an interesting alternative um but yeah we'll have to wait and see a little bit on him uh forwards so this is the interesting position I'm stacked in my my forward spot I've got harand 15 million uh for him 10 goals three consecutive blanks but the stats are just absolutely obscene as they always will be um over the season um it's more of a blip isn't it we we've already seen the Champions League he's gonna um he's he's he's going to revert back to to form pretty soon I've got Watkins who I know you know quite a few people maybe have maybe Bend off in the last few weeks he's been doing well for me there is some concerns that he's getting benched a bit earlier than you'd like 65 70 minutes uh he did um was benched in the Champions League game as well Duran got his sure it's not his first start is it maybe I think it is his first other than other than the cup um but uh yeah we we imagine Watkins is going to come back in good game against Bournemouth then it's away at Spurs as well I don't really hate even those fixures for him then it's probably a case of moving him on to to a Palmer when those fixtures turn around so yeah harand slanky and um and and Watkins I'm pretty stacked up top I do think I'm missing a bit of a trick with some of the the cheaper um forwards we've mentioned quite a few of these already I think Jimenez is the standout for me um four goals and assists for him he's in that kind of Purple Patch era that he was he was in before obviously his awful head injury um he's an incredible player all his day f are playing well um you know eight points per 90 for someone that costs 5.7 million is is just an absolute bargain so I think if you are considering one of these cheaper Strikers he's probably the one to go for I think we rule out Cal lein I know the fix is good he can't score you've got to be able to score and he can't um we look at we look at COA as well given the fixures have turned around for him the importance that he's got in that side I don't mind that I don't mind strand Larson if you want to go down even further and save a bit of money I wonder if the ship sailed a little bit on chriswood um given the fixtures I think he should do all right against against Leicester I would back him to score um in that um it's just from that um the fixtures aren't great I mean if he does score against against Lee he's going to be really popular given his given his price um to be fair it's West Ham and Newcastle it's not a bad Run is it then if switch in 13 I take it back he's I reckon he's probably still a good pick up even after even after Leicester but yeah Leicester West Ham and Newcastle then ni switch in 13 is he better than gimenez know let me think let me let me know would you rather go Jimenez or uh or wood um go M forward probably is actually quite close between them isn't it I think I'd go those two overa for some reason I thought wood had um like really tough games coming up but he's other that Arsenal game they they all look pretty decent so yeah he's uh he's definitely a consideration the stats aren't aren aren't too great um other than that not really a huge amount of options is there isack was someone I thought could end up being in our teams all season obviously that injury was it going to take for him to become a bit of a consideration uh for us probably quite a lot V's back in contention for brenford the fixures aren't bad for him either .77 ex with 90 was obviously very popular before the injury that he had again I think there's probably better options in there and what's happened with Mata I mean I owned Mata earlier in the season I got that brace from him we're all talking about uh you know the the fact that he was it the second most go goal since glasner took over um you know but yeah obviously unceremoniously dropped and and getu is getting the nod so I wonder know how long that's going to go on for I don't think Mata can be too happy when when Palace aren't scoring goals and he's been dropped and he's being such a key man for them trigger lips is in the chat he ask who I'm talking to that's a good question trick I I do often wonder that as well I'm just here talking to myself pretty much as yeah as uh actually the views have gone up to 705 yeah thanks for all uh sticking with me and and cheers I've kind of missed these these solo streams there's something there's something a little bit they're kind of relaxing in the way but also a littleit bit frantic because you kind of you've got to keep talking you can't really have too much time just to kind of sit and and have like a a silence you know when you kind of bring in someone when you're the hosting and you kind of bring someone else in you can have a little bit of a pause have a bit of a drink kind of collect your thoughts you just kind of got to keep talking but

crypto which I feel a bit funny about in nfts he's I mean he's really enjoying that um too fan team is something that I've played um which obviously has the gambling element again it's not something

us so so yeah do check them out if you're if you're interested uh fixures though look we've got a new graphic and again I want to give a shout out to I mean honestly so much of what we do on blackbox comes from the viewers and the people that that watch this I mean the patreon WhatsApp group that we've got is absolutely incredible and the Discord channel is is growing and I love interacting with people on that um Ed's brother um Ed from Scout his brother's has done like the the intro video for us which we love we've had other people do the graphics FB poker playay has done the sound for us and now we've got Le and Liv doing things like the prediction website that we've got which if you're a Godfather team member you can track all the predictions that you're um that you're putting in and see how you kind of compare to others obviously they built us this graphic so Mark and I can track our predictions and enter them in um you know where would we be without the kind of community and it's been a bit of a tough week for me in the community this week um for anyone that's kind of following that um but there's so much of it that I that I you know I still love and still enjoy um so yeah do uh yeah just want to say thanks for anyone who's who's helped out Mark and I because yeah it does it does mean a lot to us um just someone's point out they're not in order which is BR W stop Chris yeah this was something that I learned from James last week that the games that so the three o'clock games for example are in alphabetical order so it would be Aston Villa uh brenford Brighton Man City it's just not something I'd ever thought about but yeah it is weird them not being it's that does this so Lee if if you're watching this from Australia make sure these are now best CL or people are going to start kicking off let's Ratt through these though it's ler Forest tomorrow night I'm playing Moreno I don't feel too good about it I think Forest probably win this game I think Wood's gonna get something out of it as well but I think Leicester scor they scored in every match so far it's a great comeback against Southampton uh too um but I think Forest have just got a bit about them at the moment I think they're defense is is nice I like minkovich and I like Murillo SS is actually looking like a decent goalkeeper uh now too um they've got you know good attacking options they've they've kind of built the team around getting wood service and yeah I think they'll they'll won this one out I do think leer are picking up though um I'd kind of written them off maybe at the start of the season but yeah I think they've got options and I think out of the three promoted teams they're by far the most likely to to stay up uh Man City Southampton this is going to be a blood bath surely I've gone for a 4-0 so as Mark um I have harand trible Captain in my team uh currently I think they they score multiple goals I think southampt are going obviously try and low block but I also don't think they're going to change their philosophy passing around the back I unless they completely change the way um they they play I think they're still going to try and kick it around and try and find a bit of space I don't think they've got a good out ball to get the ball to and I think City going to exploit it with the pressure that they've got and the players they've got I I just think it's going to be a really really tough day for Southampton so 4-0 hopefully some foden and Lewis involved but but harand uh getting all four of those goals would be lovely uh Brighton wolves I think we win this and if you remember mata's uh solo goal he scored last season one of the best goals I think I've ever seen great for a repeat on that um I was really impressed with Brighton um given that we had players come out for international break we had like M injured wck went off injured you know we had we've had Pro we've had like thumpings from from Chelsea we've recovered it's been a really exciting season already for us um I'm really impressed with r I think he's a he's a real differential if you're looking for someone completely different for a onewe punt and I think we'll have a bit too much for for wolves but I like wolves and I want to see them start getting some points that they that they deserve so I've gone for I've gone for two one here and it's it's a 31 for for Mark uh brenford IP switch Greaves is out I think this could be a big win for brenford again again I quite like it switch so maybe I've gone a little bit a little bit lower than maybe I should have done two-nil for them uh Mark's gone for a 3-0 inmo should come out of this with something good obviously got the brace against Southampton and the fellow promoted team um I think he could do very well in this one so if you haven't got inmo I think if I you know harland's obviously the biggest concern if you haven't got him but I think B's got to be up there right I'm expecting him to to come away from this with a with a double digit uh Villa Bournemouth very impressed with Bournemouth so far this season I think that defeat against Leicester was was really surprising but in other games um they they've looked really good um I've gone for two-nil Villa and this one though they're another team I just think they'll they'll get the win in this and looking at those defensive numbers surely at some point um the the clean sheets are are going to come marks given Bournemouth a goal in this a two-nil for Villa with Rogers and Watkins would be lovely as basically the dream result for me last time with with both of them scoring this a shame Rogers seems to get booked every time he he scores or it would have been a a bigger Hall uh Everton fham I've gone for a 2-1 fulam Mark's gone for a 1-1 see there's a bit about Everton at the moment start pick up a couple of wins a couple of clean sheets in the last two games two I just think the form of himz with Smith row supplying is going to be enough to see them through on this I think we might start regretting selling Smith row I know a lot of us have done if youve still got him I think he's still a perfectly fine hold to have in your team um so yeah I'm backing F him in this one uh West Ham man united I think of all the teams I've been least impressed with this season Southampton um probably bottom of my list um and then West Ham close to Second bottom I I just think they're so easy to play against like you look at the space they were allowing Spurs to have in that game why aren't they packing the Midfield why aren't they making attempts to try and stifle like creative players like kazki was just given license just to completely run the show um very strange and it's not the first time we've seen them do that against Chelsea I thought they were really poor as well I think ipswitch really flattered them um the way he switch played and approached that game I just think it's not a great it's not a great time um for them at the moment and I know Man United playing tonight there a bit about them with' hiling back we've gone at you in the fores in um so I'm backing them to to get that to get that one if there was a garden center game and that's what JS says I think it probably is the West Ham Man United game though isn't it I I wouldn't be canceling my plans to uh to you know to watch that one uh Palace Spurs I've gone for two1 Spurs Mar's gone for 3-0 Spurs I think if if Spurs were to win this 3-0 I think glar is going to start fearing for his job which seems unheard of after the end of the season they had last time out 3-0 no slanky no Johnson and no uh no porro involvement I think that would be pretty pretty unlikely I think this is the game we start seeing some some points for Johnson and sanki I think both are good picks going into this um Palace fans might start turning on their players a little bit you just never really know what you're going to get with with spur so if Palace if Palace score I don't think it's going to be too surprising Chelsea Newcastle I'm really really jealous of Palmer uh you know this week um he's someone that I really want in my team I look him every week and and think he's he's got great potential he's getting one assist and getting bonus I thought he played really well against Liverpool um as well I can't see any way he doesn't get something from this game haven't been impress with Newcastle they got the clean sheet against um Everton away but other than that they very very rarely keep away clean sheets um and Chelsea are doing very well on the um the expected goal involvement table for teams so I'm backing Chelsea to win this I wouldn't be surprised if pmer had a a a same both of these goals and comes away with a big ho so definitely consider um yeah definitely consider of bringing him in if if you don't already uh and then Arsenal Liverpool interesting game no celba um for Arsenal Liverpool looking really strong going to be a hell of an atmosphere at the Emirates um for this one I think a draw is probably the most likely given that new team is going to want to lose this one I think we have to consider Liverpool as a title Contender this year along with Arsenal along with Man City it's going to be those three um right at the top um so yeah I think I think Arsenal will take a draw in this given that cba's out um Liverpool will probably be hoping they can they can create a few problems for arsenal when then get something Mark's actually gone for 2-1 uh in this um for Liverpool so yeah we can see kind of how that how that one goes um I mentioned the prediction standings you can get involved in this if you're blackbox uh Patron Mark is currently beating me which is very frustrating with his 55% correct outcomes uh 9% correct scores I'm on 49% so I've gone under my 50% Target but I have I think I've got one more correct score than than Mark has uh so mine's mine's at 10% I'm having to extend this list each time just to keep me on it so I definitely need to start picking up uh hottin is winning this with his total score of 73 uh 59% correct outcome and 16% correct score incred and he's missed six matches and he's still top so congratulations to him Andy who was on earlier he's just ahead of me he's on the 50% Target 10% uh correct score so yeah well done uh well done to him but yeah if you're interested in getting involved in this head over to the blackbox patreon sign up and we can get you involved um in uh in this competition there's a trophy for the for the winner which hottin is currently winning Captain C this is uh I mean it all just points to Har doesn't it mean sck's uh touch in the Box for 90 10.6 his shots in the box is 3.1 those stats are really encouraging um for sacka but he's playing Liverpool and he's a doubt so you can't really consider him harland's next his 10 goals uh we don't need to talk about him he's going to be captured by pretty much everyone other than James from plan FPL who won't own him don't know who he's going to go for I imagine he's going to go for Palmer with Newcastle at home uh I mean he could go for slanky away at Palace given his Spurs connection but I don't think he will I think he's probably going to go for Palmer in that that that's who I go for if I didn't have Harland um foden's on this list as well if you think he's going to start and play centrally I think he's a potential option if you haven't got Harland we mentioned inmo as well home to ipswitch I think he's a good pick with his six goals this season but I think personally the question is do we captain or do we triple Captain um and yeah as I said I think I'm leaning towards the triple Captain uh this week this was my team I showed this earlier with Andy uh the triple Captain chip isn't active on this but it come is in my my main team my move is going to be seeno to garnacho uh this week benching Gabrielle um playing Ry Trent Lewis Moreno foden Ando garnacho Rogers Harland probably triple Captain Watkins and sanki so yeah I'm hoping for a decent uh Green Arrow uh this week that's pretty much all the content I've got uh for this stream more than happy to I got two beers I think it was a bit optimistic and bar even started this one it's hard to drink and talk to be fair um if you want to get any questions in for me uh I'll try and answer as many as I can I've got a couple of super chats to get through too so thank you for sending those in and yeah thanks thanks for sticking around there's 677 people watching live if you could drop a like on the video that would be amazing um if you're watching this kind of post YouTube drop us a comment as well let us know if you enjoyed it and if you're listening on the podcast give us a festar review and drop us a review on that too yeah these things yeah like I I keep saying about the community and how great it is you know being a being a I hate the phrase content creator but I don't know what else to call myself with this because I guess I do create content it just feels like a bit of a wanky term um but yeah it's a funny experience because I love it and I love talking football and I love doing blackbox with Mark and I love interacting with people and stuff but yeah there are times when it gets you down a little bit you know I've I've had quite I think I've probably had more negativity over the last couple of Seasons than I've had um in any other year that I've done it I think a lot of it does relate to to rank and obviously had a poor season last year it's getting a little bit better this this year but obviously it's not great um yeah is it's obviously not begging for compliments and stuff but it's it's nice to know that people enjoy the um the podcast and the streams and things and you know ultimately if people weren't enjoying them and they didn't they didn't like it then you kind of would wouldn't bother the reason why Mark and I stick around is because hopefully we're we're doing something that people like and and we keep enjoying as long as those two things keep happening then then uh then we carry on um yeah it's some sometimes a bit a bit demoralizing sometimes um but yeah going private I think on Twitter is is definitely helping uh right let's take a look at Andrew G thank you very much for the 499 Super Chat evening chats I'm 4.2 million yeah I've been there mate do not worry uh saaka Diaz Gabrielle and calv luin to Palma foden gimenez and at Nori for a minus 12 what I am I losing the plot a minus 12 I have taken a minus 12 twice in my life and both times it has not gone well um I mean I look at the four players you're looking at Palmer foden himz and eight Nory I like all four of those I look at the four you're taking out and think is there massive potential that they go off over the next few weeks saaka Diaz Gabrielle and calv lein I mean saca's a doubt Diaz has got tough fixtures and you know has missed out the last couple of games Gabrielle's got tough fixes K can't score I don't I don't hate it I don't hate it Andrew I mean if you've still got the wild card maybe it's time to think about using that but if you haven't I'm finding it hard to to say no to it um you know you're 4.2 million you've got foden at 6.6% ownership you've got Palmer who's a great pick himene in great form go for it I'm gonna say go for it unbelievable uh yeah I like it Andrew I'm not going to try and talk you a bit uh I know it's for a minus 12 but I think it's it's big big Improvement to the rest of your squad uh Caleb is in the chat uh Caleb is one of our patreon tier uh members uh don't ask him for his opinion on goalkeepers because he's absolutely bloody useless picking them um and he's asking me for a goalkeeper move reyya to Onana oh God just stick with reyya Caleb I mean I know you've kind of broken him and you're you're not really seeing any any Joy from him but I still maintain Arsenal are going to be one of the best defenses in in the league they've had three red cards in eight games um it's been a bit of some freaker kind of occurrences uh I I just think you know I know the fixures aren't great but if if Arsenal do keep a clean sheet in the next couple of games he's GNA have made a couple of saves and be in the bonus and I mean Manchester United defensively I'm I know theyve they've been they've been okay but I don't fully trust them I I would just leave it you you're going to keep chasing goalkeeper Halles you're going to miss out on on ones from your own team Ray is a good goalkeeper uh I would I would just stay with him uh Davies family first play one of Robinson or Davis and one of seeno or Smith row I'd definitely play Smith row against Everton uh so I think that one's quite easy um I'd probably play Robinson as well yeah I think Robinson and Smith row I if if you do I don't hate playing Robinson and seeno um but I would I would think that I mean I've got film to beat um I've got film to beat Everton so I think play your two filam assets there they're a good team this season uh Hing good to see Hing Al some one of our patreon members is it worth a minus four to SW sacka to son hope to pay for your beer as all you're very kind uh is it worth a minus four to swap sacka to S that's a tough one again if if we get a leak the cartel gets a leak sack is out yeah it probably is I mean it depends on your benches isn't it um you might have a decent player on on your Ben you know if you've got seeno on your bench I'd probably just just play him bring him in um minus fours are are tricky to get right depends what your what your plans are for some long term if if you're going to look to get rid of him for Palmer or someone in a few weeks it's probably not worth it if you think you're going to keep him right up to game week 134 um it might be the move to to make I'd be a bit reluctant to take a minus four to to swap sacka out I think sacka is gonna come back into consideration in a few weeks if he lines up against Liverpool you might be wanting him back kind of straight away I'd hold unless you're 50/50 or less that he's not going to play and then you can consider it depending on on who that bench on who that bench option is uh I won't read yours out super duper just because it's I don't want to mention the person that you're talking about uh FBO gold you mark oh it's a it's a nice soy one you Mark Credit to the F Community ignore the likes of a certain someone I'm sure you discussed foden but what's a summary I'm avoiding uh yeah I mean the summary is I've got him I'm happy with him I think he starts I think he plays centrally I can't see him playing on the left or on the right I don't think that's where where pep wants to use him um I spoke to Luke about it Luke thinks foden is at risk when pep wants to make sure he's got control of the Midfield and if he's playing against like a combative side in Midfield then he might be someone who drops out like we saw with with Wolves against Southampton he's not anticipating much of a Midfield battle and normi so he's he's pretty sure that Fen is is going to start um in that I just think you know ranks are pretty low it's game week eight we can take a punt on someone you've got sacka with tough fixtures and and potentially injured um know Salah as well um son is he the best option I don't know I just think there's there's there might not be too many opportunities to go for someone like foden because of of all the other options that we've got and against Southampton I don't think there's there's many better better punts we know what he's capable of he's an absolutely like unbelievable worldclass player on his day and he's playing the worst team in the League I genuinely think they are the worst team in the league um so yeah go for it I think it's it's pretty safe uh Matthew Perry and die for wha or just play it safe with wood just go for wood just go for wood I think that's an easy one I think given what I've learned about the fixtures tonight I'm a bit worried about the oing wood and again I wouldn't don't think I'd be saying that kind of at the start of the Season uh whist is a fine pick but he's been injured we don't know G what we're going to get we know exactly what we're going to get for wood we're going to get an attack who are basing you know their team around around getting service so I think I'm afraid it's a pretty boring answer for me in that and Dr David 1963 agrees there you go uh Sam V says Bri play wolves already this year wasn't easy 31 don't know why everyone's piling on 8 Nory this week no I think you can wait a week on him um I think people are piling on him because they're getting rid of Trent and and Gabrielle or CBA um and it's not really that obvious to nowhere to go if you looking for kind of the medium to to long term um he has got the attacking threat um I mean who else you go for we talk about how there's a bit of a lack of options at kind of four five like a mikeno or something like that you get in a Nory he's probably going to concede against Brian I'd be very surprised if we didn't score in that but I wouldn't be too surprised if he got an attacking return and then I think he is the best four fiveish option Defender so I could I can see why people are kind of going for that uh let's see if there's any more questions before I call it AB says about Edison is killing me now can't keep clean [ __ ] yep you and praz both um I think it's uh he's not someone that I've ever wanted to own but then again I thought Ray would would do the job and he hasn't either so yeah it's it's a bit of a shame uh and I'll take one more question um if the question is just from trigger hard rested for Stones this week I hope not trig considering I'm expecting to play the triple captain on him Mo says good SOL at this yeah bit of a strange one not had to do a the Black Box solo before not sure what's happening next week I think Mark said he might not even be around next week as well which I'm sure will upset quite a few people uh might see if luk or Andy's around Hopey Andy won't have another delivery it was a bit last minute with with Mark because hopefully pip isn't listening but Mark literally forgot until about 7 PM last night and was like oh my God I just realized it's Pip's birthday so I hope I hope he's treated as something nice I've met pip and yeah she uh she puts up a lot with that man bless him I love you mark right I'm going to call it there thank you all for sticking with me it's amazing to know that we've stuck around 700 people watching even though I've been just chatting um on my on my own um sorry for the technical issues at the start hopefully the graphics were okay on this stream um and yeah I'll be back next week with someone not toly sure who it's going to be but I'll definitely be back next week and good luck this game week if you are triple captaining Harland I hope he goes absolutely mad for you uh and same if you've got foden too because they will be the deci side whether I come into next pretty happy or pretty miserable anyway that's it from me thank you and see you next week [Music] [Music]",23028,21087,good evening everyone welcome to fpl blackbox ahead of gw nine take two how are you mr andy mode you right im not too bad mate is it is still lagging or are we all right no were good i think thats it i tried quite an optimistic setting the resolution to 4k and i think that might be the reason why things were as great as they were but hello to everyone im sorry that mr mark sus isnt here but its great to see you and if youre your first black boox of the season isnt it is indeed its the first black box of the season ive missed its been a while i dont know the last time i was on i know my favorite one was when we were roasting your wild car but i think that was a little while back now that was a friday night mid midseason wasnt it wasnt it the exact before christmas probably burned into my into my mind luckily my season started a little bit better this time so its not quite as as bad has it been have you found the season so far you been enjoying it its not been too bad ive ive had a little bit of a struggle so far this season usually im a little bit higher than this but its been ive made a few moves a little too early and that sometimes hurt me and i seem to have avoided the liverpool midfielder points i ive owned three of them and seem to have owned them all at the wrong times but its its picking up a little bit now got a green arrow this week so hopefully that can carry on and the teams looking all right so fingers crossed its i think this is the first time ive streamed with you for a while where youve been ahead of

cover the big talking point of the week and i know youve briefly spoken about it already on the scow cast but it is this whole sack content creator cartel theres already comments about the cartel in the chat that im im seeing whats your take on sacka gate there was a lot of last minute moves from sacka to son to foden from popular people within the community do you think there was anything untoward going on no we certainly didnt get any bloody news did we no i know and i said this to you before we streamed is that if youre getting news and not telling me im not going to be very happy so im pretty sure there is nothing going on behind the scenes i think it was just a lot of good managers making a good move sacka was not 100 going to play and a lot of people wanted to move him on the next week anyway and i think thats just what they did they jumped on two assets that they thought could do quite well this week and had nice fixtures moving forward which was foden and son i kept sacka myself i moved havs out i kept sacka and keeping sacka meant i got minkovich off the bench so worked okay for me i know jamm a little bit but i didnt move sacar out because i knew i had minkovich first on the bench and i think those people that had a good bench or a good person that could in there was less of a risk as those players that maybe didnt i can i can see why they made the move i want to move sacker out this week it was always my plan and if i thought he was definitely going to be out or i thought i need to move him out to get another player in i see it as a good move personally so i do also think as well people keep forgetting that these managers could have like two three four transfers in the bank at the moment so like moving a player out like that theres less risk i feel doing it when youve got lots of transfers so i dont think theres anything going on personally and if it is im not privy to it so id be very surprised you ob but theres theres nothing going on is there as my god im getting im getting called out as part of one of the people that sold him with 20 minutes of the headline and i what happened to me i got by bloody boers tweet when he was impersonating that arsenal and who sent you that list ah and in the godfathers chat bloody mark southerns shares it and hes been caught out before like that and i clicked on it and my normal check is just go over i was thinking of selling him anyway so i was looking for any excuse i click on the link he sends i check the subscriber numbers 20k i look through the previous tweets and they all look legit and thats what boa did smartly if you could call it that this time is that he created a bit of a pre loop because normally its just inject emojis and youre like okay clearly thats thats bua this time he done the ground workor and it just it completely got me so i looked at that transferred sacker out went back to the group chat and someone said thats thats boer mark and it was it was too late and thats normally the thing that catches you out and then sacka didnt play foden was benched he came off and got the assist it was a real roller coaster andy im not going to lie but ultimately it was the right decision because i had dibling for a sub but it surprised me how many people had forgotten who bua was because hasnt done anything for a little while and then all of a sudden i had people in chats going whos whos bua whos this bua why do you all know that this is fake and as soon as there was an extra letter in the charles wats thing i was like i know this is fake but the fact you did the sacka move because of it i thought i was absolutely brilliant and the fact mark sent it to you as well but you brought foden in so it didnt turn out that badly did it no and the two players that people were bringing in were son and foden and both of them got some points for the owners and i think thats what sha a bit more of a lens on it because had they both blanks i dont think people will care i just think i can i thought all week saaka would play and it was only when i saw the team arriving at the stadium and he wasnt in any of the pictures and then we had the old andy martin thing of him going to the stadium and hes all of that was just was just brilliant i was probably going to sell him this week anyway and because it was like 5050 at that point i just thought what im gonna do it a week early and bring him in and sk says getting buono in is a good cover story i love that as if id make that up to make myself look like that much of an idiot what i love someone else in the chat has put we know you two arent getting leaks because look at your ranks its like if we were getting leaks you think id be 17m at the moment ive told this story before i told it to you earlier but the only the only leak ive ever had genuinely was last season someone messaged me i spoke to a fair bit on twitter and said just heard liento playing like today and he was in my team and i had him benched and i was like do what im gonna im gonna risk it im gonna play him off the back of that benched was complete rubbish its the only leak ive ive ever had its it is a funny one what i did this poll and i just thought theres a lot of like pe theres a lot of people like trigger lips has done videos on it and als done videos on it and theres lots of people calling into question like the integrity of content creators and i just thought out of the general twitter lot so this is a sample of like 2800 people if there was this secret whatsapp group this cartel group that people think there is well some people think there is which gets team leaks youre allowed to be in it but youre not allowed to ever share them and if you ever share them youre booted out immediately how many people would join it 76 said they would join that league i love that so i know its people give it all the high mighty and i think that 24 at least half of those would still would do it i know and to be fair i said to you before the stream when you showed me these results the thing is there are some people out there that wouldnt join it because theyre already part of it so you got to take that into account as well but i if you offered somebody that opportunity of course they do it but i think as soon as youve got a certain amount of followers and i dont know how many it is specifically as soon as you got a certain amount of followers its seen as is wrong if you do get leaks and things like that but you look at the biggest guy out there which is lets talk fbl he gets the leaks and he shares them all every single one he gets his shares so i dont know what people want to be perfectly honest but i think its f i dont think there is anything going on that we dont know most of the time no i think its a shame with because andy gets a lot of the brunt of it because the biggest account and people say is he doing it for clout on his deadline streams andy doesnt build his deadline streams as being this is where youre going to get the leagues people turn up because he might get them and he has a list of people that he trust that sometimes they in those leagues before but he always shares them with people so i dont know why he why he gets some of the stick that he does in this regard dont know i think people just attack people that are theyve got a big following bas i think and its unfortunate but thats where you get the most interaction sometimes so people wouldnt be doing it if they were just shouting into the void they want to make sure people interact back with them and thats what they want half the time which thats what twitter is isnt it its not been the best place over the last week or so hopefully it starts to pick up a bit and we can start having some nice chats again but its its not being the best place anyway lets talk some fpl stuff just quickly cover my team this week it was a bit of a disaster 33 points im sure a lot of people can sympathize with that raya trent gabrielle lewis and davis all blanked in defense foden came in he got the assist from the corner in the 90th minute four points inom o to rogers came in last minute for dibling who id been saying i was going to play all week and then i just suddenly went why am i playing as southampton player lets just get rogers back in so rogers got the got the goal booked again though it always seems to get booked when he when he scores which is annoying harland with four watkins did well for me with eight and salanki has been disappointing with two and i benched moreno who got six on my bench he would have been quite a nice differential but a bit of a bit of a me game w best we just move on right lets just move on from this one we can move on to mr mark southerns team managed to have a o worse worst with he got 26 i think fleen was his i know rogers was his highest scorer but fleen was up there with four trent cba with minus three lewis with two gabrielle with one seeno rogers and bumo f and harand salanki so a pretty similar team to mine had celba with minus what did you make of the celba red card how do you think thats going to affect arsenal going forward i think it is i think on scoutcast the other day we did a little bit of an analysis on arsenal and it shows that they are already conceding more chances than they were most of last season and theyre not putting up as much xg i think the odard injury is a massive difference i think he is such a controller of the ball in their midfield and i think these have been a massive miss i do also think theyve played a lot of their games with 10 men which hasnt helped their xgc this season either and their disciplinary record is shocking compared to the rest of the season its compared to the rest of the teams i dont know whats happen like they wanted them to be tougher and theyre doing that by getting red cards all the time which isnt great for their assets and cbra celebra managers the people that went celebra and gabrielle or cra and rya and went for that double aral defense have been punished quite brutally to be perfectly honest and minus three from cba is that is brutal so i think i think it is going to i think hes only going to miss one game isnt he but i think arsenal double defense especially with their fixtures moving forward i think id be moving off one personally and when you got a player like say 8 nori or someone like that who could be good especially from next week onwards i think id probably make the move myself i it is a one match ban the commentators on the match definitely said it was a three match ban and i went back and listened to it again and they said three matches but its not violent play right so its just a one match thats how i thought it was just one game fine so hes back for newcastle and chelsea but misses the liverpool game so not ideal for mark hes already made a couple of transfers ill talk about those in a bit your team though absolutely flying 40 points coming up trumps mate it wasnt looking that good i i had i had rogers as well who didnt do too badly i was absolutely gutted salanki got nothing i was out i was out in town when it was happening i was every goal that went in i was thinking sans got to be involved and every time he wasnt involved so i was absolutely gutt about that but the big one was that those forest players on the monday night and having word who could have had a hattrick like he looked good again like he hit the post he had a few sitters that he missed and then milinkovic as well milinkovic who i got in on wild card and i was eyeing up some of these nice fixtures palace we were talking beforeand and we put cells in our strictly come captain in selections palace honestly that all they do is just pepper goalkeepers from outside the box and they cant finish to say their low so that any keeper against him it looks absolutely brilliant to play him and sals got an 11 pointer in the end so the people that were waiting on say a ss and a wood for monday night got help themselves to 18 points but they saved me massively so i was on about a 500k red arrow until monday night and then i ended up getting a green arrow of about 100k so i will take it can you remember the last time a monday night game delivered for people its been a while it has been a while it used to quite i swear the one that sticks in my mind im pretty sure hazard played against west h and got and got a brace or a hat trick wasnt it and he absolutely killed it on a monday night i remember that quite vividly but if thats the last one i remember then that says a lot thats about eight years ago wasnt it eight years normally its like youve got one or two players left on the monday night and you think right they can save my game week they can they can do something for me and then you watch the clean sheet get wiped out after like 10 minutes and then player gets subed at 65 and youre like get up my whole monday night for this but that was a good one for forest owners it went it went well are you playing linkovich this week against lisa im not hes first on my bench i think or second on my bench i cant remember now but hes not in my team currently okay ive got moreno so he is in my in my team at the moment this is the great and the good sheve been added to this after not usurping whats the word beating grayhead last year that was the punishment that he faced you coming into this im top of the three of us somehow 785k which puts me fourth which is pretty surprising just below pra one point behind prz seven points behind harry had an awful week again with 26 prz and harry both well praz harry and mark all with 26 pretty remarkable ben kellin though 54 points with his son captain thing is were looking at him as smashing it and hes only 300k like there are other people out there that are like already in the top 100k like hibo is around the 100k mark and i think its absolutely mad that hes i feel like hes played well recently ben but like i said hes only 300k i expected him to be way more than that and thats after a almost 350k green arrow so its been its been tough so far in this league i would say and i looked at my overall rank and thought god im going to be bottom half of this easily so to be top half i think it says a lot about the start of the season but we got to remember as well that its very rare that weve had triple captain be played quite as much as it has been so far thats been played a lot so maybe thats t a little bit to be taken into account because all those that played highland got 17 extra points so maybe thats skewing things a little bit but its been tough 300 kb in the top and most of us over one mil is not usual i think its been the relentless form of as well i think quite a few people didnt start with him at the beginning like myself few a lot of people sold him on wild cards in maybe gameing five or six and hes carried on doing well two double digit halles in his last couple of game weeks so if you had if you had sellah youve been youve been doing well bl says its the bad and the worse good name good name for this league i have to say seb is struggling hes hes down 48 48m not doing the scout cast riew this season and just seems to love banking those transfers thats what does it thats what does it see you leave the scout cast and it all goes to part no hes i think i saw his team value is like 995 as well like hes like you said hes kept hold of those transfers and i dont think its helped him yet but im hoping that he has a couple good weeks and he starts storming on up but hes only what just under 50 points behind me and thats three million rank so hell make that up hold i thought theres theres theres not much in it between a good rank a respectable rank and even a poor rank at this stage so dont panic dont panic too much lets take a look at some stats this is team data defense and liverpool are at the top of this they have we i think we all know that theyre the best defends given from what weve seen which is one of the major things that slots bought in in his brief tenure villa a second interestingly not a team that i trust particularly but 89 is good quite tough fixtures to come lets talk about man city though ive got lewis i every week they just seem to concede its frustrating i find with this team data defense stuff that like youve got liverpool there okay they seem like the the best defense at the moment but is it any other defense that you trust at the moment funly enough forest was one that a lot of us put a bit of put a bit of money into because that their data did look good and they got the cheap options lewis at least is cheap like were not paying for gardol like that although he turned into prime roberto carlos at the weekend but i do think forest i do think forest are good liverpools an interesting one for me still they do look good but their fixture run has been the best it could possibly be up until now so the fact that their fixtures are changing now if they start keeping clean sheets and having this good a daya against teams like arsenal villa city like then we can start taking them seriously but i theres not a lot i was thinking about this with goalkeepers theres not a lot of goalkeepers i fancy moving forward either but theres an awful lot of fixtures that are changing soon so if youve got those high upside defenders like anate nori like that ive already mentioned them anyway their fixtures change you dramatically moving forward brentfords are looking good moving forward brightons look good after a while like all of a sudden youre looking at a few different teams and its just based on fixtures but i think forest and liverpool look the two best defenses ive seen so far villas interesting though because i thought villa might struggle with their whole playing in europe this year but theyve killed it in europe and they seem to not be having too much of a hangover after the games either so fair play to them its arsenals the biggest one for me it has been a bit of a drop off but do you think a lot of that is because of the red cards or do you think something quite dramatic has changed this year well i think i think its it doesnt help does it when youve had three red cards in eight games its its going to skew the statistics a bit against leicester it was just two freak worldly goals from james justin not much you can do about that i wonder if and james made this point last week that maybe they do switch off a little bit against some of the teams they expect to beat because theyve got so much of the ball because theyre so in control if youre two it up maybe do just take your eye off the prize a little bit and i think we saw that in the first game against wolves should have scored in that match villa was a tough game next but again i think watkins miss an absolute sitter in that game so i dont think its its surprising that maybe they havent hit the heights that we thought given that start but at the same time no clean against leicester southampton and bournemouth i know is a concern especially when you go into the run that theyre going on to now with liverpool newcastle and then chelsea are you are you doubled up you doubled up on arsenal defense im not so i was going to and then we werent sure whether ry was going to play so i brought flein in and went with havitz got me two goals in two weeks i was quite happy with that and now ive moved on from hav to salanki so no i wasnt and i think those people that went for double arsenal defense it was the floor play it was the im expecting some clean sheets in this run which was a good decision but its like i said its been its been paid off in the in the worst way especially with the celba red card rounding it off for a lot of managers there so i do think weve got to look at the data were seeing at the moment and think that arsenal arent the elite defense we thought they were but liverpools the one thats most interesting to me in terms of maybe not a trent because hes expensive we got to try and get those premium mids but when youve got players like canate who look good and kellerer who could potentially be in goal until december with reports that are coming out like theyre not the worst players to potentially to invest in but i do want to see how they get on against an arsenal and a villa and a city in the next five im i am doubled up on arsenal ive got gabrielle bench this week because i cant bench re havent got a backup benching gabrielle is a is a risky move given the given his threat from set pieces but i do want if we are going to see people pivoting to a double liverpool defense because i know theres theres jotter theres diaz theres salah theres trent theres theres there are decent picks there but if youre not going for salah i can see why people arent going for one of josh oraz given the fact that they get benched and theres rotation around that js now got this little injury so i wonder if maybe its its trent canate and then you leave the third spot open for salah i wonder if were going to see people doing that when the pictures turn id be very surprised id be surprised if people went double liverpool id be surprised if people are even got one at the moment unless its trent and even then the majority of people i know that have trent are thinking of selling him because hes just that cash cow that you need to move to those premium mids so id be very surprised the fixtures i wouldnt say are there the brighton games not too bad but brighton can attack so im looking at those fixtures and thinking i dont think now is the time to be moving to it from 15 onwards theres theres a case for it but i would be very surprised i think people are going to be moving off defense quite quickly and theyre going to be pumping their money into midfield because thats where it all is and were going to get to a time from 12 onwards when were wanting sacka were wanting son were wanting fod palmer were wanting all that harland still potentially and i think i just dont see it personally i think were going back into the old days of make your defense as cheap as possible and pump everything into midfield and strikers which it did wouldnt it thats exactly what it used to be 45m defenders across the board so well see do have trent well thats what do you think trents going to be the sacrifice for this i think so i think its just too easy a sacrifice to make in terms of you free up like three million by moving down from him and i and i think thats the biggest thing that people are going to do and when youve got players like i said like eight nori or i dont know mikeno that you can down to and they got nice fixtures i think people will do it other end of the table the obvious ones i switch a bottom i think no surprises there southampton and then leicester all in and around two expected goals conceded every game clearly the teams to target chelsea down in 17th i knew their defense had been bad but it has been bad according to the stats its interesting that one the three at the bottom of the three youd expect and theyve got some weve got some players with nice fixtures against them this week in brenford and weve got man city as well chelse is an interesting one and i think a lot of people didnt go for sanchez because they thought he was going to lose his place but i dont hate the idea of sanchez because they do concede a little bit of xgc if that makes sense but i would love to see how much his whats that stat was it xg prevented isnt it xgc prevented for keepers id love to see where he is on that because he always looks hes got a cler in him but andy let me let me let me get that up for you right now there you go at this there you go it is xgp is there its its ones four so its not great well hes hes four for points per 90 one is one ranks about one of one of the lowest on show i think ray rayer and leno the two lowest and pford pi at 23 leno at 24 no its an interesting that the two liverpool boys being top if we find out allison is out for a little bit longer kellaher is going to be extremely popular but onan is always going to be up there because we can see so many chances as well but no i was interested to see where sanchez was on this but i dont think that its its tough with chelsea because the fixtures arent there for quite a while are they youd be looking to move in maybe 12 or 13 and again if youve got a keeper thats is doing fine youre not going to be moving for one are you no just to just to reiterate what this what this chart showing so expected goal prevented just indicates how i think i think its the best metric of how well a goalkeepers been performing this season you can see hanson is there at the top at 46 hes prevented nearly five goals with some of the saves that hes made pope there at 31 anana had a great start to the season 33 you wouldnt expect to see rea in the minus so hes hes let in more goals than he should have done give what we seen from the champions league when hes saving penalties and rebounds and all that thing its you wouldnt expect to see it reversed allison at 27 so theres been some keepers that have had strong starts the season very interesting though that fens bottom one well not bottom but hes bottom of this list and minus 170 but hes got more save points than anybody else this season hasnt he yep hes made 42 saves and next best is pope with no next best is hanson with 40 and then its pope with 35 so thats quite interesting but fens also got the fixtures coming up i switch bournemouth leicester at home and hes got two nice away fixtures youd be hoping for something in that run i would have thought yep lets look at some attacking data dont know if you like me i think i probably trust the attacking data more than i trust the defensive data especially when you see teams like city and villa at the top when what i see is teams that can play quite well against them apart from in the champions league theyre doing well spurs are a topic that were going to talk about bit more this episode ive got a table on some of their assets and they are top non 90 expect to score two goals a game with chelsea second 186 and man city just off that 185 but spurs players weve both got slanky how are you feeling about how are you feeling about that hes going to be in and around the attack the thing that is interesting at the moment and i was listening to the above average pod and they were saying the same thing is that he seems to be doing that firmino role like firmino used to do for liverpool where he does a lot of the work to make sure that the wingers get what they need to do and madison kisi brennan johnson son seem to be thriving because theyve got that striker up front and you think theyve had te o vera richison and people like that for a little while since kanes left and i think is what theyve needed theyve needed that player thats a bit selfless and will do that not great for fpl nobody ever picked forino he did have those weeks where he did well i think sank will still be fine but i think if youve got sank and hes your only attacking spurs asset i think you probably want to try and get another one especially for this little run that theyve got as well and the fact they in 11 and 13 theyve got two captain all fixtures my biggest thing is which one do you go for because i think if you were set me up so perfectly i know i know because look at this because son is the one that seems to be the explosive player that weve weve had an fpl before and hes the one that can hit those heights and get you the braces hat tricks whatever its going to be brennan johnson seems to be getting a ridiculous amount of chances inside the box and touches inside the box which it shows here but ive got such a soft spot for koseski like i think hes creating so well at the moment but is he captain a ball i dont think he is so all roads lead to son madison the big thing this week was that he got taken off at halftime he was playing well but they needed to change things and he was the one that went so i think all roads lead to on personally unless you need a cheaper option then i think you probably just go brennan because the value is there interesting i see i think all roads lead to brennan with this touch touches in the box 64 for brenan johnson interesting keski isnt isnt far off that with 62 so having like 10 touches in the box a match essentially i havent fact checked this mark southern sent me he did also send me boers tweet to take it with a pinch of soul but he told me brenans touches in the box is identical to harlands in terms of her so you think about parlans position his average position and where he just stands or johnson is getting that many touches in the box from out from out wide i know i brennan looks nailed now doesnt he i think hes going to be playing every game for them moving forward kisi i think is as well son weve been told by andre already that hes going to be managed this season he cant be playing every single game 90 minutes hes got to be managed a bit more so you would think that raras and verer are going to be coming on for son and maybe verer coming on for salanki so that koseski role i think i think between koseski and brennan i think theyre fine and theyre an awful lot cheaper as well i do have a soft spot for koski but i just think son is there and hes the one youd want to captain in 11 and 13 would you captain brennan johnson in 11 and 11 in 11 or 13 against ipswitch will f him no i wouldnt but im not looking at im not looking at alternative captains other than other than harland at the moment i think if i think if holland wasnt in the picture it would it might be it might be a bit different whos holland got in third who city got in 13 is that the brighton game city of liverpool away okay so you so you probably do need an extra captain lets get the lets get the ticker up hang on so in 13 city have liverpool youve got that great spurs game against fulham im looking at chelsea with villa at home thats not too bad either arsenal with west ham away i dont know would i rather have son than saaka or palmer thats the thing that i keep coming back to i just dont think i would sacka is the one because i think sacka by the time you get to 12 if hes fit again which will most likely happen youre looking at sacka in 12 back because youre going to want to be getting on some of those arsenal assets again potentially but palmer if you dont own palmer now when do you think is the entry point when do you think i need to get him back in for that game you is the leer one in 12 you have you have to get him in 12 dont you so if youre getting lester if youre getting him in 12 and you need son for 13 because he looks the best captaincy option or a or spurs when how are you going to own all these players by well i dont i dont think son i dont think son is needed that ive said this from the start of the season its its probably going to come back and bite me when sons ends up to the top scorer in fpl like that but if im looking at son compared to saaka palmer salah harland hes the fifth one for me out of those hes the one im im picking last and the fulham game isnt its not like southampton at home or rip switch at home hes got him in 11 harland has brighton where he will get chances against us believe me so do i need to get do i need to get some full at home when palmers got villa at home i dont mind that for palmer and then palmers got him switching south antony for side i think palmers got to be a mustone from 12 isnt he i the more you look at it as well hes in 12 hes got leicester in 14 hes got southampton the big thing for me with palmer now is like and i mentioned this on scoutcast about five weeks ago is that hes one of the only players that can go big anymore like i dont when you look at other players and you think harland can salah still has it in him but hes slowed down a little bit compared to what he used to be sacka doesnt massively go big i know he has what twice but you wouldnt expect it in a game week whereas palmer against the right oppos position just goes mental and hes not playing in europe i just think when youre looking at those fixtures its not like you have to look and say but hes he might play midweek hes not going to so i feel like palmer from 12 is a musthave so its just when the rest of them come in but like you just said if you swerve son and you go for a koseski or a brennan johnson it means you can get on a sacker and a palmer quite easily in 12 the alternative is youve got youve got j johnson compared to to son there about 3m saving there you could go jackson over palmer theres going to be what a 4m saving there no lets stop you could do or you go havs over sacka right and thats thats your 15m saving i was going to ask you which of those you think is a decent a decent tradeoff im guessing its not its not jackson its not its not either i dont think i dont think i want either over them as gone hello is it just me whats happened has as disappeared i have no idea whether its just me hello im assuming this is just me im waiting for him to come back in rip as just you andy cartel got him he mentioned too much hes back again do what this is one good thing though about streamyard is awful is what ive learned from this whole experience has been not because of you because were having to wait we have to pause between each bloody thing so we can we can speak they were just talking to me it was lovely but at least one of us can like leave and come back in it doesnt kill the whole stream true i was i was just saying if we are looking to save some money like where can you go foden to harlands the other one isnt it do you ever think foden is going to be a replacement for him no not at the moment no and we talked to luke quite a bit and hes saying like there i we dont see a time at the moment where fodens going to be nailed on because that hes not going to play him on the wings and that midfield three with gundan is where he wants to go and he seems scared of teams playing in counterattack so it doesnt look like theres going to be a fixture where you can say fodens definitely going to play even this week and i dont think fodens a good buy this week because a lot of people with foden are probably going to be moving off him in a couple of weeks so its tough and its a shame because you want them but i dont feel like theres over a longer period of time i dont feel like you can compromise on sacka palmer and harland i just dont think you can whereas son could be one you compromise on but the others i just dont think they are of course theyre all on penalties as well which is such a major factor too ive got ive got foden probably until gw 12 and then and then im probably going to be losing him for palmer in some way losing foden before spurs at home though doesnt feel amazingly amazingly good if he play but thats the thing you think thats going to be a case all season do you think fodens going to be a doubt all season or you reckon hes eventually going to be straight hes going to be number one its a shame i think he is i thought kdb being out i thought that nailed him on but i think with rodri being out and gundan coming in and the fact that hes quite scared of that midfield not being secure enough against teams he seems to keep picking gundan who i dont think has been great since hes come back either and i think it just means that foden ends up being the player that doesnt play and what savio is great at the last night and so is matas nunes as well and i just think fodens being turned into little bit of a scapegoat and not getting the minutes were expecting and coupled with the fact that hes had a bit of an injury too its meant that unfortunately one of those explosive players from last year were now having second outs about and its not like we havent got other options like i said you got saaka palas son and thats just naming three of them and then youve also got players like inmo so all of a sudden it just becomes foden is a bit more dispensable this season than he was last season its got mahrez vibes hasnt it like when we all thought mahrez was going to be first name on the team sheet when hed been playing well week after week after week he gets he gets benched mar has never won play of the season like foden did last year and it does seem surprising that hes potentially going that way but he has had history with pet before la last season was the blip for foden because he played pretty much every game before they i know i know and to be honest i thought that was it then but i think things have changed i think the rodri injury did shock it did shake them quite a lot as well to lose him for the whole season i think is massive for them and i just think ive always said with foden last year he was playing every game so it was absolutely fine and when harland didnt play or de bron didnt play he was he was another focal point which is awesome as well but i just think this year hes turned into a player that were having doubts about every week and you dont want to invest in too many players youre having doubts about every week and like i said theres alternative so ill be getting rid of him for palmer most likely not this week itd be 12 were all saying that because marks in the chat with ar and hes saying he doesnt feel confident about phone and regrets buying him and wants to move elsewhere all three of us have got him and were all feeling same way but and remember as well weve got fent and lewis so its its every week youre looking thinking if both of those are benched like thats a massive hit to your team and the upside hasnt been there yet so thats the other issue like hopefully when he does play and if he plays this week we could be absolutely loving life and he scored in champ league as well so well see what happens but hes not as certain as he was last year thats for sure weve got a little bit sidetracked just to come back to the spurs assets table i saw a question asking us to rank these in order just to just for the podcast listeners son comes out top on terms of points per 90 71 and hes mentioned kazis assist potential hes the highest on show out of som brell and kvi madison and sanki 34 pretty much brennans the one whos getting those shots away getting the shots in the box hes having those touches all in the area as well slanky is having the best chances if you look at xg per shot non penalty 026 thats the highest so when he is getting an opportunity its the highest xg shot and he has had the most big chances as well with eight compared to brenan six so he so sinki is still there im not like you say when i watch him im not that impressed but the stats dont make me think hes an awful option i just think brennan is probably the one i if you could offer me those if you offer me the swap for free i think id probably take you up on it i its interesed that though like salanki i think is fine because hes that striker position and when youre looking at strikers i think harland salanki wood seems to be the ideal three at the moment in terms of fixtures looking forward and form and things like that but that midfield slot i think is quite tough son its im fighting in the back of my head with keep it simple and simple as son because i can afford son and thats just keeping it simple hes the goal scorer but i do think brennan and koseski at that discount you it cant be ignored and i do get what youre saying with brennan johnson ive just got this thing in my head that brennan johnson is g to revert to type soon but as kfy i ive owned koseski before and hes done well but again hes got his issues where hes not a goal scorer so i think ill probably end up with son but kulu is the one in the back of my head but are you going to bren this week or are you is this just the one youd pick if you could no im not my transfer well i be interested to get your take on my transfer because im im doing these match of the day notes on twitter and the reason for that is i want to give myself a reason to watch match today because i didnt watch it religiously last year and i had my worst ever season and i think i was watching a lot of live football but i think sometimes its nice to get a bit more of a broader overview of whats of whats going on and i think match to day is helpful because they break down the tactics and you see players that you might not otherwise have seen or mentioned and i have to say the player that ive been impressed with for a little while and particularly i thought against brenford was your was your mate garnacho your boy i thought he was unb i think he had eight shots in that game against brenford i just think hes taken it a bit personally being benched in those first few matches and theres always question marks around man utd and whether tar can get them playing any brand of football that doesnt rely on individual brilliance but he is a hell of a player isnt he gacho and the fixtures again were going to come back to the fixtures graphic but the next five for man utd west ham chelsea leicester ip switch everton four of those five games against four of the weakest teams in the league well five if you include chelseas defensive you see exact so i theres been so many false dorms with united and it happens every season every season we got hang on theyve started looking good again i will say that front three of rashford gacho and holand did look good and i think holand is the one that weve missed because xerx is not that type of player i do think that looked good bruno that assist was absolutely beautiful by the way and if anybody else did that wed be talking about it for ages but i do think na would be the one to own especially if he continues to play on the left and i think for the fixtures weve got coming up especially after this week i think west hams fine but the fact that weve then got leicester at home everton at home and we got i switch away i think they are investable in but its who are you buying him instead of and if youre buying him instead of a spurs asset i dont think id do that i think id want a piece of that spurs pie and then i think you could probably wait until 11 because i dont think youd invest ahead of chelsea even though their xgc is so low i dont think you would so i think youd probably be waiting till 11 but from 11 onwards i think a gun at is not that bad we could even see a rashford resurgence which he was about 80 owned at one point after co wasnt he so ive just im used to this with united theres been so many false dawns and you think youre getting in there early and you just end up going at the wrong time so but garache would be the one i think ive already got salanki i could double up on it as a sp thats what marks doing hes got slanky hes already moved for johnson hes going one step further and buying a player we havent even mentioned from spurs which is porro as well bringing in por bringing in por this week so hes going hard on spurs i think im gonna im gonna pivot away from it and have a bit of a punt on gacho i had him last season i feel like he owes me i benched him for two braces last season yes i remember that which he was cheap as chips last year wasnt he was hes five million was i think i got at 49 something like that and again its stupid but playing a 49 asset feels rough playing a 62 asset feels a bit better even though its the same player its just how a feel works this is a new graph that graph chart that marks put together this is so the this is game we nine xgi of course game week eight xgi so this is xgi just for the game week and i think again this goes quite nicely with like talking about match of the day and highlights and what you see from individual game weeks we look at the stats we look at like a longterm view and last six game weeks is typically what we look at also can we to see who were the the top performers in individual game week i mentioned gachos shots hes not in the top 30 that i could see for xgi non penalty so they werent exactly great chances but he was having a lot of them brenan not though i wanted to talk about playing for leicester hes at the top of this 15 i was impressed with him this week havent been since he signed for leicester hes looked all right for briyan when ive seen him play hes come with a big reputation i think tz said he was going to be the next liel messi which is little bit of hype to live up to hasnt delivered i dont think brighton ever knew what his best position was tried to put him on the right hasnt got the pace for that we had a lot of players who could play in the 10 but delivering at leicester what your thoughts on him i dont hate him at all i think hes hes playing all right i think leicester fixtures what they got forest not great potentially but then ipswitch and then from 13 onwards it looks a little bit rosier so i dont hate him as a pick i i play so rare ive got him in that and hes absolutely killed it in that in the last couple of weeks so im very happy there its just i think weve got other players that are cheap options to say like are you going to go with a bonon not or are you going to go with a rogers i think is the comparison because youre not going to want more than won midfielder at 5m and rogers has been the absolute bargain so far this season and i think stop it stop it im not too im not totally sure about that i think that i think can well if you we look at some of the players on this list midfield is around five million so youve got buon not okay hes probably not too many people going there but i think hes a hes a decent option seeno is on here at 56 two rough games fixtures on exactly two rough games but you get through those and then its its a decent run do you think smith row is now just not a consideration for us at f im i mentioned that so on scoutcast two weeks ago hibbo and nacho were saying smith row is still a good and i was thinking i dont know whether he is anymore i would much rather have a rogers over him id much rather have a bonon not potentially although like i said the fixtures maybe arent there enough for me but i still think rogers is the one if i was wild card and rogers would be on it 100 and then youve got patrick flor saying no mcneel i think mcneils an option at 56 with the fixures theyve got i love mcneil ab rutter at brighton is welbeck still out well herzel has said that he it sounded painful he said hed like knocked a nerve in his back like that and he was still in quite a lot of pain id be very surprised if he if he started against walls ferguson played 60 minutes im not sure hes got a bit of a knock as well but it could be rter up front if ferguson and welbeck are both out we might see rter up top not sure wholl then play at the 10 maybe gruda comes in at 10 or they push like a bber up to that role but i think rutters looking like we paid 40 billion for him it raised a lot of eyebrows hes looking like a good player for us do the one player im going to mention and this is my like my differential i think hes like 3 owned is is dams guard for brenford hes on set piece is hes looked good hes got three assists in his last two games i think hes someone especially with their fixtures coming up as well what they got ip switch bournemouth lester all at home you could youre gonna be wanting to play him potentially i think if you could have a double up with him and aumo and then have those three premiums i quite like that so damars my little one hes not on this is he but hes hes one that im gonna tip moving forward okay well in the sleeper draft the wire have got dams guard and i know i know zal was talking up on the video they did today so i think they probably agree with you on that two more players i wanted to mention on this list one of them you own already chris wood 091 seven points for him gimenez ral gimenez 57m next 074 if we jump ahead and we come to the forwards table both are where are they on this list so where wood is 17th i saw them earlier wood is 17th and jimenez i dont think is jimenez is eighth on this say 63 for him and wood at 39 woods expected gold per 90 is pretty low isnt it at 39 thats the first thing i saw 78 accuracy and 31 conversion surely thats not sustainable surely i think he looked good he could have got more on monday night i genuinely i think he is he is such a good option if i was wild card in this week i am almost certain i would have chris wood in my team if i was wild card in after this week i might move to somebody else maybe like a ca or al larson because i think they might start coming into teams with wolvess fixtures changing and i think theres going to be a bit of an uptick there but i think woods fine i feel i feel like if youve got wood now he if youve got wood now youre going to keep him and youre going to be more than happy with the fact that youve got him but if you dont he is going to be the player that you do not move to every week and hes just going to keep it theres always a striker like this always a striker i swear every season that does this and hes just going to be that one where people are like no he wont carry it on and hell just keep plooding away i reckon its funny is it because at start of the season everyones saying not only is he is he not gna is he not going to do that well but hes not going to play because alanai is going to come back and take his place that that has just been put completely to b nuno likes him i think he likes what he brings the side and hes almost built its a prettyy exciting attack with hudson ado gibs white and elanga but its all about anderson was unreal absolutely unreal so its like a like a man city light instead of harland up top theyve got chriswood christ is this just you trying to bring mark back next week saying all the lovely things about him i wood has been mark has got it wrong about wood he was pretty anti him in the start of the season and i think he always thought that tyra would have eventually come back and take him but hasnt done so i were on borrow time with you now were were six minutes past eight youve got a tesco delivery arriving any minute itll be coming any minute mate bit of i know its like this its all the track can talk about but itll be here in a minute i would have thought well before lets theres still some stuff i can cover i can i can carry on when youre gone but lets jump ahead quickly just to your team for the week in case you do have to jump out im sure people will be desperate to know what your what your plans are al they can watch them on the scout cast i doubt theyve changed too much but this is your team read out for the podcast thiss and tell us what youre what youre thinking so i got flecken in goal ip switch at home gabrielle pedro porro rico lewis foden and bumo rogers sacka who is yellow flagged at the moment and then salanki harland and wood up top with harland as my captain minkovich first on my bench seeno and greaves dont know where that injury came from but greaves is out for about four weeks unfortunately and valdar ss my on the bench i am pretty happy with this team this week i think this team looks fine this week ive already got that triple up with city ive got double up with brenford which is in buan fleen its a pretty good fixture there my main move im looking at this week is sacka out and it will be for a spurs mid its just which mid i go for i think ill just end up going son but i am very tempted to save the money and then move from foden up to palmer got money in the bank so ive got 17 in the bank so i can move sacka to anybody i could even go to palmer now if i wanted to but i think i will go for a spurs mid its just which one i go for but your voice then i know i dont know what happened sps mid but the one thing i will say is i dont want to move down from sacka and then spread the funds i want to keep those price points because i want those two premiums in midfield so i dont want to mess it around too much but sacka will most probably be going out i have no idea whether hes going to play this week and even if he does i dont expect a lot from arsenal in that fixture i think that is as tough a fixture as its going to get for them so im pretty sure thats what im going to do its between son and koseski i think sorry because you and mark are both going to be trebled on spurs and that just isnt something that i would consider i dont fully trust them i know their attacks been good but they went down against west ham theyve they threw away a two goal lead against us they were awful in the second half against leicester in the first game they seem to have good spells and theyre not so good spells theyre not theyre not a very reliable team for a triple up on potentially but then they were top of the xgc they were top of xg on your table and i look at it and just think with those two fixtures coming up in 11 and 13 to have that triple spurs and potentially the captain one of them as well those are the games where you can get massive games and i just think why not go for a triple up captain one of them and if it hits youre flying and i think thats the thing i quite like at the moment ive done it with city i went early on foden which im quite happy i did because otherwise id be second guessing whether to go for him now so the fact ive got triple city this week this is the week where im hoping to hit big with them as well so i think you can do that every now and again and this is what ive wanted to do so im pretty sure im going to do it okay no man united players for a good run you faith yes maybe a gun out show but i its tough moving him in with all those other players i want ill show you my team the order of this stream has gone completely out of the window technical issues stream out the window youre off to do a s a tesco delivery its all its all carnage this is my team its raying goal with trent lewis and moreno im playing him tomorrow against lester away foden and bumo seeno rogers harland watkins and sanki up top ward gabrielle davis and dibling on the bench i could do smeno to johnson ive got the money to do it but i think im going to take the punt on garnacho as i said i like it just something a bit different i think hes like eight owned something like that i remind you this in two weeks i know i know and all the people on these all these people the on the video as hat united hes never going to bring in united player and all that its like well thatll shut you up when i have one in my team would it im play every are you going to are you going to wait till the last minute and get the lead before you get gacha in or are you ill see what comes through in the cartel whatsapp group and make the decision on that i will be hoping for a leak on moreno because theres always a chance he could miss out for im assuming my request to join the cartel is still pending on the pending youre not youre not a patreon member yet so thats true give us your give us your eight quid a month whatever it is and then you can cool i see what i can do big question though andy the big question that we havent even covered yet and it doesnt show it on this graphic but it is currently active on my actual fpl team triple captain any consideration for it no none at all no i just dont think i would ever play it in a single game week just dont think i would i the fixture is there and the people that did it against dip switch and you got the hattick 17 points times three lovely but double game week you you only have to get a goal in each game and max bonus and youre beating that so i will not be doing it this week and i would be absolutely shocked if i did it in a single game week in any season i dont even know what the double game weeks are going to be but it could be that i dont go with harl it could be i put it on salah could be i put it on someone else palmer potentially so no i 100 wont be doing it but little birdie tells me you might be im about im 6040 in favor of playing it im im im a bit annoyed with myself i didnt play on him against ip switch because mark and i did the match of day challenge mark didnt own harland it would have been fun to have gone into that challenge with him with all triple captain i did have it on him very briefly and then i took it off and i thought its a bit too early for that like game week was it game week three was it game week two was game week two wasnt it against z switch i just thought that was a little bit early my reasoning for thinking about it now is that ive seen southampton play and i cant remember too many teams who play as badly in defense as theyve done its its the perfect blend of a manager who isnt changing his philosophy and in some ways fair enough thats how they got promoted he doesnt want to change but do you need to adapt a little bit to the premier league well it doesnt look like martins done that at all is individual mistakes from the defenders and its just an overall real lack of quality in that southampton team like ramale was a good signing for them hes not a bottom three goalkeeper but that defense that midfield the fact theyve not got any like out ball to a to a stri and i know theyve got archer but you almost want them to have a big man up top that they could at least a leave bit pressure and win the ball high up and hold it up they dont seem to have that i just dont know how it can happen that city dont score multiple goals against them at the weekend whats your expectation on minutes by the way my my the doors just gone so ive gotta go thats it youre gna go pleasure as always thank you guys i had a i had a message lined up for that and he needs to go put his petty fu away this is the first time ive ever done a proper episode of ffi black box on my own and i did the team selections last season but havent done them on my own so i thought i could just carry on for a little bit ive got a couple more charts go through the predictions can answer some questions and things that people might have its just me if you dont like listening to me then probably best you drop off because im g to watch the numbers go down crazily but if you if you want to stick around and we can we could do another half an hour or so then lets go for it i do need another beer though should i grab that now should grab that in a bit not too sure anyway lets carry on for a little bit more lets talk about some of the other tables that weve that weve got so lets go through the main one so this is defenders over the season you saw on my team earlier that i had leaf davis at the in the starting 11 hes third for exped gold 90 at 24 the question marks are around whos going to score the chances that hes he creating hes a creator of chances shots per 90 when you compare that to trent is half you to porro two its a lot a lot lower than that but the chan he creating is high 25 is the highest its now higher than trent i think he was second going into the league trent had a had a difficult game but davis is creating chances a reasonable rate theres just no one that can has grab the bill we right well do okay i do defender tables then ill go grab a beer so i do like davis i just dont know and mark said this on the video he did early in the week the lets walk fbl is it enough to be creating chances when theres not anyone who can who can put them away and i think weve spoken about fors weve spoken about himz and kuna and stran larson i think dap was big flavor of the month going into the everton game and now its its massively gone down to some of the others so well see how we switch bounce back from pretty bad losses to lose that heavily to west ham and then to lose to everton in that manner i think mckenna is going to be worried you they come out of a bad run they want to start getting points on the board and then its a bit of an issue so hes hes still in my team but i dont think im gon to be playing him for the for theable i mentioned porro marks bringing him in this week nine goals conceded is the problem he hasnt had the attacking returns he got that goalen game week one not anything else yet i thought l impressive in the west ham game getting full a lot i do wonder if brennan cutting in means porro goes out a bit wider means that hes not getting as close to goal as he maybe was last season hes still getting chance hes still getting opportun he had that shot near the end which was absolutely awful but it was from the right the right area so i think hes hes a decent option this week i play i played davis over moreno and i do wonder if it is like a clean sheet first policy that we need to adapt with defenders i think particularly this season when the bonus doesnt favor attacking defenders the bonus does favor the clean sheets you clean sheet for a defender we i think it was murillo sals did aa get a bonus in that in that forest game maybe not but its the its taking multiple attacking returns almost for defenders to get something from it so a bit of a bit of a concern im not im not totally sold on po i think five5 is a bit too much for him but if youve got him i hold him i dont think id be ill be buying him is there any else on this list that inspires im not totally sure there is i think minkovich is a good shout if youve got him hes 20th on this list he has an assist i think he got that the week before last i think hes hes probably the stand out in that in that bracket i dont mind anor either but those fullbacks dont seem to be getting forward a lot too much so i think milinkovic would be the one if youre looking to tap into to forest nor 13 two goals two assists not point2 exra p maybe expecting that to be a little bit higher given the attacking returns that hes got maybe suggest that hes been a little bit lucky but i think hes gonna be pretty popular brighton are gonna thrash him this week so dont buy him yet but going forward the fixures are pretty decent for them couple more that we flagged here we got manning at southampton climbing up the thing look at his chan to created for 90 in the top 10 thats why were featuring him vanderberg in 4 not sure what happens with rico henry when hes back but 4m i think vanderberg is probably the one to go for and you got moleno popular seven points and from himly keane got the got the big hole but mikeno didnt do b mikeno didnt do badly 89th on the list though it doesnt look like youre going to get much from these everton defenders so youve got to hope for those one nil wins that we know d is capable of but again if you got him at 4 five hes probably a bit of a keep so theres some decent option defense theres no one that i dont think anyones a mustone trent and gabrielle obious got the tough fixtures lewis is a hold but isnt getting the clean sheets i think his minutes are pretty safe i think walkers being phased out a little bit maybe its a bit of a shame that stones has made a bit of resurgence because he can play in that inverted role but im hoping that lewis carries on vels 18th going to pay a little bit more for him two goals in the last couple of games hes a good pick as well but no one i think we said this a lot last season about defenders not having too many standouts i think were getting that again this year so when ive got trent who have i got ive got trent gabrielle theyre okay ive got lewis im reasonably happy with ive got moreno that could be any not kn forest defender im pretty happy with those going forward so not looking to make any defensive moves in the in the near future right im going to grab a beer im going to stick the stting soon back on no technical issues im hoping at this stage its a bit annoying with andy were a little bit delayed so thanks for sticking around a couple of people have left with it just me but still 770 people watching again were caring for about another half an hour or so im going to grab a beer and i will see you all in about five minutes i am back and what is better than one beer sure the answer its two beers there we go thanks for sticking around everyone still 700 people watching this which is amazing if you i know its a thursday night but if you fancy grabbing a alcoholic or a nonalcoholic drink and joining me as we just rattle through the rest of these tables thatd be great andy is getting his tesco delivery and then he has got his community thing where he does that educational id like to think its like a seminar that he does so if youre if youve enjoyed listening to andy tonight hes always great to have on standby for these things then check out his community and get involved in that right lets have a look at the mids to cheeky hazy james absolutely i dont like brog as a company theres all the problems the owner has had in the past and im im not a big fan of how they how they operate but unfortunately they do make a pretty decent beer and im a bit of a sellout so thats where thats where were at right lets look at midfielders jaks shaking in the background he all right its fine midfielders then so i mentioned garnacho he doesnt feature well on the list for the last the last we show which was on the xg for the game week hes showing up highly though on here hes 13th on the list 57 x non penalty for 90 i always say around 06 is your like elite elite numbers if you if youve got a player whos consistently getting around 06x non for 90 i said that puts him in a pretty good position when you consider the fact hes 62m as well i think thats nice inter that is identical to seeno who i would be selling for him the amount of shots seeno has is crazy he does have some from outside the air i think hes had the most shots of all midfielders which isnt shown on this on this table but in terms of those shots in the box for 90 297 ranks him to just below salah 298 look at br though 388 thats the highest of all of all midfielders but garnacho 269 decent touches in the box per 90 737 for him thats higher than s think just making some hacking nois in the background thats nice ive disturbed he was fast asleeping so went and got these got these beers so it maybe feels a little bit sideways doing that doing that seeno toono move its villa away next for simo then its man city i think he could get some joy in those i dont think selling is a if you were going to keep him i wouldnt say its a terrible move lets put it that way im just trying to tap into those slightly better fixures for and hes a player that i just genuinely like and im not seeing him many teams so theres a few reasons there to get rid of him savio is fifth on this list i think hes an interesting one as well if you are looking to go for someone a bit different in the man city attack i thought he played brilliantly in the champions league last night hes looked good in the games that ive ive seen him play he was amazing for jona last year thats why city of the ball i dont think weve seen that player from him in terms of that output if you look at some of these numbers look at those touches in the box per 90 992 thats in the top five for midfielders the ex 9 is high as i mentioned 71 and i wonder when his that right hand spot of the city team does feel up for grabs and hes clearly got hell of a lot of talent so i think its going to be sooner rather than later we see him see him break in the trouble is do you weigh or do you take a punt on it for this southampton game i think again hes someone thats thats flying under the radar he might even be some i was considering but im im already tripled up with lewis foden and harland someone to consider malison sats a great on in 85 ex on 90 but andy mentioned his early sub i think thats a bit of a concern when the players going off halftime poo klu said they werent controlling the game which is rare for him to say that i think hes said in the past that he doesnt care about how much they control it as long as they score goals and get the win but they need to do something to get a handle on that west ham game and it was definitely that sub that changed things around and kf impact that he had i think after that sub was made so i think hes now a bit too risky and weve already talked about the spurs players i still think johnson is the one to go for but i dont blame people for going for son because we know what his pedigree is like its just that its just that sanky role we give him a couple of weeks s does but if hes blanked again in the next couple hes going to be someone that we that we look to take out i dont think its fair to talk about midfielders though without talking about morgan rogers at 5m at the start of the season hes not showing up on these stats you have to go down to 4 first to find him 38 hes not in the top 10 for touching the box hes not in the top 10 for chances created his points per 90 is 447 its decent but its not crazy this is where i think watching games having a bit of making sure youre watching different teams not just your team when theyre theyre on tv and using the eye test is clear because rogers to me is looking like he could be one of the if he made team of the season the way hes playing at the moment i dont think anyone would be would be too surprised he is so key to everything aston villa are trying to build whether its in europe and he was i think he was man of the match in the game the other night every game ive seen him play hes demanding the ball hes making the runs his end product is maybe lacking a little bit and i think if he starts adding those goals to his game what is his potential for five milli hes never going to be a palmer were never going to have a palmer again i dont think at five million but if rogers goes on and could get 170 180 points and kick on from where he is now hes goingon to go down as one of the best value picks of all time and i think thats more likely that trajectory for him than he gets phased out and doesnt become a an impact for us so if youre listening to this and you havent got rogers youre always going to have other priorities maybe to go for the big hitters and the moving around but when it comes to saving money and you want to bring some money out of maybe some of the other midfielders even if the pictures arent that good i still would suggest that you take a look at rogers because i just think hes hes hes an absolutely unreal player and i wonder how long its goingon to be to gets caught up for england surely hes got to be ts got to be looking at that and thinking hes a player that can offer us something a little bit different because if you think about de bry for city and the way he can get the ball in midfield and just drive forward we need more players like that in the in the england squad from that central role that maybe hunt foden because foden has never delivered for england so rogers had to had to mention him the other player i wanted to mention here just move on is fatu as well of leicester thought he changed the game when he came on against southampton i know harrys got madidi hes i saw his podcast where he was wondering why hes hes got him i dont think he was a bad pick at all i was tempted to go there at the start of the season theres now other five options who are looking a bit better with jamie vardy with madidi and with fatua theyve got some real players that can hurt teams and again hes not one youre gonna buy now but i think hes hes someone to watch because hes got that explosiveness in him where over this run of games lester have got once we see him naed in that team i do wonder if he could present a bit of an interesting alternative but well have to wait and see a little bit on him forwards so this is the interesting position im stacked in my forward spot ive got harand 15m for him 10 goals three consecutive blanks but the stats are just absolutely obscene as they always will be over the season its more of a blip isnt it weve already seen the champions league hes gonna hes hes hes going to revert back to form pretty soon ive got watkins who i know quite a few people maybe have maybe bend off in the last few weeks hes been doing well for me there is some concerns that hes getting benched a bit earlier than youd like 65 70 minutes he did was benched in the champions league game as well duran got his sure its not his first start is it maybe i think it is his first other than other than the cup but we imagine watkins is going to come back in good game against bournemouth then its away at spurs as well i dont hate even those fixures for him then its probably a case of moving him on to a palmer when those fixtures turn around so harand slanky and and watkins im pretty stacked up top i do think im missing a bit of a trick with some of the cheaper forwards weve mentioned quite a few of these already i think jimenez is the standout for me four goals and assists for him hes in that purple patch era that he was he was in before his awful head injury hes an incredible player all his day f are playing well eight points per 90 for someone that costs 57m is just an absolute bargain so i think if you are considering one of these cheaper strikers hes probably the one to go for i think we rule out cal lein i know the fix is good he cant score youve got to be able to score and he cant we look at we look at coa as well given the fixures have turned around for him the importance that hes got in that side i dont mind that i dont mind strand larson if you want to go down even further and save a bit of money i wonder if the ship sailed a little bit on chriswood given the fixtures i think he should do all right against leicester i would back him to score in that its just from that the fixtures arent great if he does score against lee hes going to be popular given his given his price to be fair its west ham and newcastle its not a bad run is it then if switch in 13 i take it back hes i reckon hes probably still a good pick up even after even after leicester but leicester west ham and newcastle then ni switch in 13 is he better than gimenez know let me think let me let me know would you rather go jimenez or or wood go m forward probably is quite close between them isnt it i think id go those two overa for some reason i thought wood had like tough games coming up but hes other that arsenal game they all look pretty decent so hes hes definitely a consideration the stats arent arent too great other than that not a huge amount of options is there isack was someone i thought could end up being in our teams all season that injury was it going to take for him to become a bit of a consideration for us probably quite a lot vs back in contention for brenford the fixures arent bad for him either 77 ex with 90 was very popular before the injury that he had again i think theres probably better options in there and whats happened with mata i owned mata earlier in the season i got that brace from him were all talking about the fact that he was it the second most go goal since glasner took over but unceremoniously dropped and getu is getting the nod so i wonder know how long thats going to go on for i dont think mata can be too happy when palace arent scoring goals and hes been dropped and hes being such a key man for them trigger lips is in the chat he ask who im talking to thats a good question trick i do often wonder that as well im just here talking to myself pretty much as as the views have gone up to 705 thanks for all sticking with me and cheers ive missed these solo streams theres something theres something a little bit theyre relaxing in the way but also a littleit bit frantic because you youve got to

people that watch this the patreon whatsapp group that weve got is absolutely incredible and the discord channel is growing and i love interacting with people on that eds brother ed from scout his brothers has done like the intro video for us which we love weve had other people do the graphics fb poker playay has done the sound for us and now weve got le and liv doing things like the prediction website that weve got which if youre a godfather team member you can track all the predictions that youre that youre putting in and see how you compare to others they built us this graphic so mark and i can track our predictions and enter them in where would we be without the community and its been a bit of a tough week for me in the community this week for anyone thats following that but theres so much of it that i that i i still love and still enjoy so do just want to say thanks for anyone whos whos helped out mark and i because it does it does mean a lot to us just someones point out theyre not in order which is br w stop chris this was something that i learned from james last week that the games that so the three oclock games for example are in alphabetical order so it would be aston villa brenford brighton man city its just not something id ever thought about but it is weird them not being its that does this so lee if youre watching this from australia make sure these are now best cl or people are going to start kicking off lets ratt through these though its ler forest tomorrow night im playing moreno i dont feel too good about it i think forest probably win this game i think woods gonna get something out of it as well but i think leicester scor they scored in every match so far its a great comeback against southampton too but i think forest have just got a bit about them at the moment i think theyre defense is nice i like minkovich and i like murillo ss is looking like a decent goalkeeper now too theyve got good attacking options theyve theyve built the team around getting wood service and i think theyll theyll won this one out i do think leer are picking up though id written them off maybe at the start of the season but i think theyve got options and i think out of the three promoted teams theyre by far the most likely to stay up man city southampton this is going to be a blood bath surely ive gone for a 40 so as mark i have harand trible captain in my team currently i think they score multiple goals i think southampt are going try and low block but i also dont think theyre going to change their philosophy passing around the back i unless they completely change the way they play i think theyre still going to try and kick it around and try and find a bit of space i dont think theyve got a good out ball to get the ball to and i think city going to exploit it with the pressure that theyve got and the players theyve got i just think its going to be a tough day for southampton so 40 hopefully some foden and lewis involved but harand getting all four of those goals would be lovely brighton wolves i think we win this and if you remember matas solo goal he scored last season one of the best goals i think ive ever seen great for a repeat on that i was impressed with brighton given that we had players come out for international break we had like m injured wck went off injured we had weve had pro weve had like thumpings from chelsea weve recovered its been a exciting season already for us im impressed with r i think hes a hes a real differential if youre looking for someone completely different for a onewe punt and i think well have a bit too much for wolves but i like wolves and i want to see them start getting some points that they that they deserve so ive gone for ive gone for two one here and its its a 31 for mark brenford ip switch greaves is out i think this could be a big win for brenford again i quite like it switch so maybe ive gone a little bit a little bit lower than maybe i should have done twonil for them marks gone for a 30 inmo should come out of this with something good got the brace against southampton and the fellow promoted team i think he could do very well in this one so if you havent got inmo i think if i harlands the biggest concern if you havent got him but i think bs got to be up there right im expecting him to come away from this with a with a double digit villa bournemouth very impressed with bournemouth so far this season i think that defeat against leicester was surprising but in other games theyve looked good ive gone for twonil villa and this one though theyre another team i just think theyll theyll get the win in this and looking at those defensive numbers surely at some point the clean sheets are going to come marks given bournemouth a goal in this a twonil for villa with rogers and watkins would be lovely as the dream result for me last time with both of them scoring this a shame rogers seems to get booked every time he scores or it would have been a bigger hall everton fham ive gone for a 21 fulam marks gone for a 11 see theres a bit about everton at the moment start pick up a couple of wins a couple of clean sheets in the last two games two i just think the form of himz with smith row supplying is going to be enough to see them through on this i think we might start regretting selling smith row i know a lot of us have done if youve still got him i think hes still a perfectly fine hold to have in your team so im backing f him in this one west ham man united i think of all the teams ive been least impressed with this season southampton probably bottom of my list and then west ham close to second bottom i just think theyre so easy to play against like you look at the space they were allowing spurs to have in that game why arent they packing the midfield why arent they making attempts to try and stifle like creative players like kazki was just given license just to completely run the show very strange and its not the first time weve seen them do that against chelsea i thought they were poor as well i think ipswitch flattered them the way he switch played and approached that game i just think its not a great its not a great time for them at the moment and i know man united playing tonight there a bit about them with hiling back weve gone at you in the fores in so im backing them to get that to get that one if there was a garden center game and thats what js says i think it probably is the west ham man united game though isnt it i wouldnt be canceling my plans to to to watch that one palace spurs ive gone for two1 spurs mars gone for 30 spurs i think if spurs were to win this 30 i think glar is going to start fearing for his job which seems unheard of after the end of the season they had last time out 30 no slanky no johnson and no no porro involvement i think that would be pretty unlikely i think this is the game we start seeing some points for johnson and sanki i think both are good picks going into this palace fans might start turning on their players a little bit you just never know what youre going to get with spur so if palace if palace score i dont think its going to be too surprising chelsea newcastle im jealous of palmer this week hes someone that i want in my team i look him every week and think hes hes got great potential hes getting one assist and getting bonus i thought he played well against liverpool as well i cant see any way he doesnt get something from this game havent been impress with newcastle they got the clean sheet against everton away but other than that they very rarely keep away clean sheets and chelsea are doing very well on the the expected goal involvement table for teams so im backing chelsea to win this i wouldnt be surprised if pmer had a same both of these goals and comes away with a big ho so definitely consider definitely consider of bringing him in if you dont already and then arsenal liverpool interesting game no celba for arsenal liverpool looking strong going to be a hell of an atmosphere at the emirates for this one i think a draw is probably the most likely given that new team is going to want to lose this one i think we have to consider liverpool as a title contender this year along with arsenal along with man city its going to be those three right at the top so i think i think arsenal will take a draw in this given that cbas out liverpool will probably be hoping they can they can create a few problems for arsenal when then get something marks gone for 21 in this for liverpool so we can see how that how that one goes i mentioned the prediction standings you can get involved in this if youre blackbox patron mark is currently beating me which is very frustrating with his 55 correct outcomes 9 correct scores im on 49 so ive gone under my 50 target but i have i think ive got one more correct score than mark has so mines mines at 10 im having to extend this list each time just to keep me on it so i definitely need to start picking up hottin is winning this with his total score of 73 59 correct outcome and 16 correct score incred and hes missed six matches and hes still top so congratulations to him andy who was on earlier hes just ahead of me hes on the 50 target 10 correct score so well done well done to him but if youre interested in getting involved in this head over to the blackbox patreon sign up and we can get you involved in in this competition theres a trophy for the for the winner which hottin is currently winning captain c this is it all just points to har doesnt it mean scks touch in the box for 90 106 his shots in the box is 31 those stats are encouraging for sacka but hes playing liverpool and hes a doubt so you cant consider him harlands next his 10 goals we dont need to talk about him hes going to be captured by pretty much everyone other than james from plan fpl who wont own him dont know who hes going to go for i imagine hes going to go for palmer with newcastle at home he could go for slanky away at palace given his spurs connection but i dont think he will i think hes probably going to go for palmer in thats who i go for if i didnt have harland fodens on this list as well if you think hes going to start and play centrally i think hes a potential option if you havent got harland we mentioned inmo as well home to ipswitch i think hes a good pick with his six goals this season but i think personally the question is do we captain or do we triple captain and as i said i think im leaning towards the triple captain this week this was my team i showed this earlier with andy the triple captain chip isnt active on this but it come is in my main team my move is going to be seeno to garnacho this week benching gabrielle playing ry trent lewis moreno foden ando garnacho rogers harland probably triple captain watkins and sanki so im hoping for a decent green arrow this week thats pretty much all the content ive got for this stream more than happy to i got two beers i think it was a bit optimistic and bar even started this one its hard to drink and talk to be fair if you want to get any questions in for me ill try and answer as many as i can ive got a couple of super chats to get through too so thank you for sending those in and thanks for sticking around theres 677 people watching live if you could drop a like on the video that would be amazing if youre watching this post youtube drop us a comment as well let us know if you enjoyed it and if youre listening on the podcast give us a festar review and drop us a review on that too these things like i keep saying about the community and how great it is being a being a i hate the phrase content creator but i dont know what else to call myself with this because i do create content it just feels like a bit of a wanky term but its a funny experience because i love it and i love talking football and i love doing blackbox with mark and i love interacting with people and stuff but there are times when it gets you down a little bit ive ive had quite i think ive probably had more negativity over the last couple of seasons than ive had in any other year that ive done it i think a lot of it does relate to rank and had a poor season last year its getting a little bit better this year but its not great is its not begging for compliments and stuff but its its nice to know that people enjoy the the podcast and the streams and things and ultimately if people werent enjoying them and they didnt they didnt like it then you would wouldnt bother the reason why mark and i stick around is because hopefully were were doing something that people like and we keep enjoying as long as those two things keep happening then then we carry on its some sometimes a bit a bit demoralizing sometimes but going private i think on twitter is definitely helping right lets take a look at andrew g thank you for the 499 super chat evening chats im 42m ive been there mate do not worry saaka diaz gabrielle and calv luin to palma foden gimenez and at nori for a minus 12 what i am i losing the plot a minus 12 i have taken a minus 12 twice in my life and both times it has not gone well i look at the four players youre looking at palmer foden himz and eight nory i like all four of those i look at the four youre taking out and think is there massive potential that they go off over the next few weeks saaka diaz gabrielle and calv lein sacas a doubt diaz has got tough fixtures and has missed out the last couple of games gabrielles got tough fixes k cant score i dont i dont hate it i dont hate it andrew if youve still got the wild card maybe its time to think about using that but if you havent im finding it hard to say no to it youre 42m youve got foden at 66 ownership youve got palmer whos a great pick himene in great form go for it im gonna say go for it unbelievable i like it andrew im not going to try and talk you a bit i know its for a minus 12 but i think its its big improvement to the rest of your squad caleb is in the chat caleb is one of our patreon tier members dont ask him for his opinion on goalkeepers because hes absolutely bloody useless picking them and hes asking me for a goalkeeper move reyya to onana god just stick with reyya caleb i know youve broken him and youre youre not seeing any joy from him but i still maintain arsenal are going to be one of the best defenses in the league theyve had three red cards in eight games its been a bit of some freaker occurrences i just think i know the fixures arent great but if arsenal do keep a clean sheet in the next couple of games hes gna have made a couple of saves and be in the bonus and man utd defensively im i know theyve theyve been theyve been okay but i dont fully trust them i would just leave it youre going to keep chasing goalkeeper halles youre going to miss out on ones from your own team ray is a good goalkeeper i would i would just stay with him davies family first play one of robinson or davis and one of seeno or smith row id definitely play smith row against everton so i think that ones quite easy id probably play robinson as well i think robinson and smith row i if you do i dont hate playing robinson and seeno but i would i would think that ive got film to beat ive got film to beat everton so i think play your two filam assets there theyre a good team this season hing good to see hing al some one of our patreon members is it worth a minus four to sw sacka to son hope to pay for your beer as all youre very kind is it worth a minus four to swap sacka to s thats a tough one again if we get a leak the cartel gets a leak sack is out it probably is it depends on your benches isnt it you might have a decent player on your ben if youve got seeno on your bench id probably just play him bring him in minus fours are tricky to get right depends what your what your plans are for some long term if youre going to look to get rid of him for palmer or someone in a few weeks its probably not worth it if you think youre going to keep him right up to game week 134 it might be the move to make id be a bit reluctant to take a minus four to swap sacka out i think sacka is gonna come back into consideration in a few weeks if he lines up against liverpool you might be wanting him back straight away id hold unless youre 5050 or less that hes not going to play and then you can consider it depending on who that bench on who that bench option is i wont read yours out super duper just because its i dont want to mention the person that youre talking about fbo gold you mark its a its a nice soy one you mark credit to the f community ignore the likes of a certain someone im sure you discussed foden but whats a summary im avoiding the summary is ive got him im happy with him i think he starts i think he plays centrally i cant see him playing on the left or on the right i dont think thats where pep wants to use him i spoke to luke about it luke thinks foden is at risk when pep wants to make sure hes got control of the midfield and if hes playing against like a combative side in midfield then he might be someone who drops out like we saw with wolves against southampton hes not anticipating much of a midfield battle and normi so hes hes pretty sure that fen is going to start in that i just think ranks are pretty low its game week eight we can take a punt on someone youve got sacka with tough fixtures and potentially injured know salah as well son is he the best option i dont know i just think theres theres there might not be too many opportunities to go for someone like foden because of all the other options that weve got and against southampton i dont think theres theres many better punts we know what hes capable of hes an absolutely like unbelievable worldclass player on his day and hes playing the worst team in the league i genuinely think they are the worst team in the league so go for it i think its its pretty safe matthew perry and die for wha or just play it safe with wood just go for wood just go for wood i think thats an easy one i think given what ive learned about the fixtures tonight im a bit worried about the oing wood and again i wouldnt dont think id be saying that at the start of the season whist is a fine pick but hes been injured we dont know g what were going to get we know exactly what were going to get for wood were going to get an attack who are basing their team around getting service so i think im afraid its a pretty boring answer for me in that and dr david 1963 agrees there you go sam v says bri play wolves already this year wasnt easy 31 dont know why everyones piling on 8 nory this week no i think you can wait a week on him i think people are piling on him because theyre getting rid of trent and gabrielle or cba and its not that obvious to nowhere to go if you looking for the medium to long term he has got the attacking threat who else you go for we talk about how theres a bit of a lack of options at four five like a mikeno like that you get in a nory hes probably going to concede against brian id be very surprised if we didnt score in that but i wouldnt be too surprised if he got an attacking return and then i think he is the best four fiveish option defender so i could i can see why people are going for that lets see if theres any more questions before i call it ab says about edison is killing me now cant keep clean yep you and praz both i think its hes not someone that ive ever wanted to own but then again i thought ray would do the job and he hasnt either so its its a bit of a shame and ill take one more question if the question is just from trigger hard rested for stones this week i hope not trig considering im expecting to play the triple captain on him mo says good sol at this bit of a strange one not had to do a the black box solo before not sure whats happening next week i think mark said he might not even be around next week as well which im sure will upset quite a few people might see if luk or andys around hopey andy wont have another delivery it was a bit last minute with mark because hopefully pip isnt listening but mark forgot until about 7 pm last night and was like my god i just realized its pips birthday so i hope i hope hes treated as something nice ive met pip and she she puts up a lot with that man bless him i love you mark right im going to call it there thank you all for sticking with me its amazing to know that weve stuck around 700 people watching even though ive been just chatting on my on my own sorry for the technical issues at the start hopefully the graphics were okay on this stream and ill be back next week with someone not toly sure who its going to be but ill definitely be back next week and good luck this game week if you are triple captaining harland i hope he goes absolutely mad for you and same if youve got foden too because they will be the deci side whether i come into next pretty happy or pretty miserable anyway thats it from me thank you and see you next week
10,fplblackbox,6-iZUPoTq2o,FPL Son Error? | GW8,2024-10-21T22:51:37Z,[Music] my word I don't know really where to begin uh it was a horrible Saturday for fbl and certainly for my fbl team and I guess we got to start with the sacka situation um from my perspective I was um I was away all week in Bulgaria that's why I didn't do the the blackbox stream and so I was I had limited time to soak up information and team news and so on I I caught some Friday night got got back that that evening land you know looked at my team on Saturday and I was basically going to roll my transfer U Where I Stood on Saturday I was I was kind of 80% certain that he would start because as we know he's had knocks in the past and the comments from carsle artetta were we're positive let's face it so I thought he was I was certainly 8020 thinking he was going to start at Bournemouth um then obviously I rolled the transfer but I almost wavered so 15 minutes before deadline I saw a tweet from what I thought was a reliable source Charles Watts uh which actually turned out to be Boer if you don't know booner account on Twitter who posts a kind of troll post to kind of misleading team news as a joke you know a joke yeah it can be funny to be fair and and this was one of his tweets and I fell for it so I put that tweet in The Godfather tier chat to try and help people in there that you know this tweet was out there it's public just in case you ain't seen it 15 minutes ago saca's not playing I then went to my desk went to take sacker out put son in because um it was It was obviously looking like he was going to start I mean he was he was back to Fitness and it was a a risk worth taking with the fixtures that Spurs had and then I looked at whatsapp and there it was as was saying among others that that was a a boa post and it was fake so I didn't make the transfer cuz I was back to thinking 8020 sacka would start turns out that as saw my post thought it was weird as well made the transfer then realized too late it was a fake one I don't know crazy um and then of course didn't turn up uh and I didn't get son and we'll talk about son and the assisted a bit but the the rest his history of course sacker didn't turn up and then it turns out a load of content creators made last minute changes which I'm not surprised about um I'm particularly not surprised about because then after the deadline I watched the Arsenal fan TV Video in which they one of the content creators on there if you can call them that said that sack was was a major doubt and wouldn't play now had I seen that before deadline that for me would have made me 50/50 no smoke without fire and then I would have made the transfer to song cuz 50/50 would be enough for me but I didn't see it I didn't know that but what I can say is if I was among the content creators or other people who saw that in advance of deadline then I would have made that s transfer so I think it's fair enough so all these people accusing content creators having secret information I think it's pretty unfair because I can only go on what I know I didn't get any secret information and had I seen that Arsenal fan TV I'd have been 50/50 and I'd have made the transfer the song cuz logically it makes sense with this with the fixtures so I can only stand up for that view that it was all open and above board and a logical decision and of course you're going to make the decision late because you're going to wait till the final moment in case you do get a leak in case you do get public information that's going to sway you like sacker scene at the ground or something so it's all understandable but I didn't benefit from it I didn't make the change because I thought he was going to start and I didn't see that Arsenal fan TV clip which for me that would have been enough cuz it suggested that there was an itk out there who had information and it would have just tipped me 50/50 and I would have made that transfer but anyway I hope I hope that's not a slid indoors moment for my season it has been a terrible game week I went into the Arsenal Bournemouth game obviously with sacka with CBA and with Gabrielle celba got the red card sacka didn't turn up and Arsenal lost the game 2-0 obviously celba red card means he's out against Liverpool which is a major blow to them in that game and it means that I'll probably have to sell celba now with the two tree transfers I've got ahead of the next game week um as for Bournemouth you mean seeno was a stand out against six shots one chance created he's now had 37 shots 10 more than any other m Fielder uh and in the end they won the game with a training ground set piece played AR at their own game a very good corner and a penalty uh it's now four out clean sheet for Arsenal and it's Liverpool Newcastle and Chelsea in the next three I think that I don't think I'm holding sacka it's a hamstring injury could he could miss that game I think I'm going to be moving him out and it's going to be ca going as well so with those fixtures and with a kind of dip in form and confidence I'm definitely moving away from [Music] Arsenal and then there's the son assist um yeah so basically the way I see it is uh the error here is on the tributing the own goal to arola um because I think once once you recognize that it's an arola own goal rather than a TBO own goal you recognize that final touch that arola had and then that means that son shot has the initial save from arola Ricochet back off to Theo then the Final Touch from marola which was pivotal enough to be cited as a means to give him the own goal so that's three touches the rul say that for an assist to be awarded from an own goal the player awarded the assist has to directly Force the own goal now I don't think in this case you can say that because by giving it to ARA's known goal we're recognizing that his touch is a significant one presumably too's touch back towards goal wasn't on Target and it was ARA's final touch that b it to B it to be a goal so therefore sunshot didn't directly lead to that go it was too's touch back the Ricochet off too too from the Save the initial save Mariola which was what forced the own goal the finals hch from marola therefore for me it's no assist now had had it been a tobo own goal I'd be more sympathetic I think it would be an assist then because for me the Sun Shop would force to save the Ricochet off to Debo and in but because they've said arola a goal they've recognize that third touch I don't think we can say son directly cost it therefore it's no assist for me and there is Presidents here if you go back to 2022 first game of the season Manchester United ball comes off the back of Dow towards the bright and goal Sanchez saves it onto mallister but mallister knocks the ball in for an own goal to mallister no assist was given to Dow even though Dow's touch was sending the ball goldw and it was Sanchez who saved it onto Mall but no assist was given to Dow he didn't benefit because presumably they felt that Dow's touch didn't force the own goal cuz mallister got the own goal and it was Sanchez's Save which forced the own goal but it's the same here it's tobo's touch back the Ricochet back to arola that forces the own goal therefore to be consistent with that incident in 2022 it's no assist now what's crazy is it was no assist and then at 9:00 for some reason an assist was added and a tweet went out the Tweet was later removed because there was a lot of negative reaction to it I stayed out of that but I I just don't see it can be awarded assist if you're going to be consistent with what was gone before there's another incident the gapbo incident from last year against West Ham arola own goal again ironically he had a shot that was off Target but that doesn't matter the shot came off of ogbon onto such on the line and off of arola for an own goal arola own goal then as well nothing was given to GPO because his shot didn't directly forc the own goal from Mariola if anything it was such's touch on the line which forced the own goal so it's the same again son shot didn't directly Force the own goal because it was a touch back the Ricochet off tobo that made arola score the own goal because it was credited to him now I don't think it should have been credited to him I think that's the mistake and in that case it would have been an assist in my book but arola and goal no assist for [Music] me as for the game itself obviously son came out with a goal and assist came out with 0.47 xgi five shots two chances created a decent game you look good in spells but it was Johnson who came out with a top xgi .93 overall five shots All In The Box again looked to threet and it's just that shot volume in the box that really intrigues me he's had 26 shots this season all of them in the penalty area and in the end that volume you know that's got to offer value going forward Madison has been a consideration but he won off at halim tactical decision by an to bring sa on and that was the trigger for the turnaround in the second half and and Spurs just blew West Ham away so Johnson continues to catch the eye I may go him over son of a bit more time this week if I if it is sacka who does make way ahead of Liverpool game depending of whether sacka turns up for midweek European game of course uh the other player to talk about here sanky really concerning just one shot one chance created had a look at the average position Maps he was the deepest of all the Spurs attacker so ahead so with Madison kuresi Johnson and Son all four of them ahead of salanki in terms of the touches the average touches that they had on the pitch and you can see it with the it test he was coming deep he was linking play Runners getting Beyond him he wasn't getting the end of things that as I said one shot one chance that's not enough 0.12 xgi is a concern I'm already thinking that despite the fixtures I don't know if he's going to deliver the kind of volume of points that I need from him and you know moveing havs after Arsenal's fixtures um soften up a bit might be the way to go I think um as for West Ham um I know actually two more players I want to is is porro and a doggy went forward and pouring forward loads porro in particular really scares me not having him he had for shots and two chances created on the day a doggy three chances created and got the assist but porro for me is the eye catcher 16 shots now the top amongst Defenders this season that volume has got to pay off I mean even without clean sheets I think he's a player that we need to keep on our adars and I think with the fixtures that Spurs have got I may well be moving CBA down to him depending on how the budget goes for me uh West Ham now yeah Kudos got the goal well taken but then got the red card so he's out for three games and that's painful for West H because their fixtures are better now but they're going to miss Kudos who is obviously is a big outlet for them uh Bowen could have got the assist his cross to Kudos did take a Def flection and it did look as though it was intended for Antonio I can see why it wasn't given harsh low for Boeing owners those brave enough to go for the differential missing out on points again and we kidos out I just think that Bo and Ro remain a very lowly owned differential so Everton won 2N at Portman Road um a big fixture for it which they I found wanting um I I starting to fear for them I I did have some good feelings about the liks of the lap and Davis going into a better fixture run but 3.89 now is their XG for the season it's the lowest in the division by quite a margin Davis came out with three chances created and he does have 20 chances created for the season more than any other Defender but I just see them scoring enough goals for him to convert that into assists dap has got four goals and he came out with a couple of shots in this game but I think it 0.18 his XG and Davis was 0.23 just too low and and Everton had too much for him in Midfield and they cope well of them at the back and in the end ran out at a caner um for them Calvin Le was the stand out in terms of xgi 1.32 he had five shots in the game Big frustration for calv L owners that he came out of a blank he had a couple of one-on ones which M did well with but yeah Cav L really should have profited M Neil got an assist now created 25 chances for the season second only to sacker amongst midfielders so he continues to offer value Kean got the other goal obviously he could be an option at the back but bran Freight is near in Fitness I guess mikeno would be the better option he came back in to the side at left back did play deep didn't get forward too much but at 4-3 he's got to be worth a look now that Everton fixes continued to be decent pford low back-to-back clean sheets is e the answer for those who don't have ryar or for those who are giving up on Ry after asked on conceding goals certainly um it's a good it's a good couple of game weeks for pford and and Everton and suddenly they're starting to look like they could be a source of value to us as well andai got the goal but it was some an error he's another one we could keep an eye on as a cheap forward option um and again just going back to itwi you know they did make errors nine errors now for the season the most of any team actually it's level with sampton and those defensive errors coupled with the fact they can't score goals could take them down half fought victory for Villa at craen Cottage Rogers came in with his third goal in the season could have had more Mr sitter before half time and came out with three shots .88 xgi which the pass Watkins .41 he got his goal over and just two shots smartly taken header from matan's corner and then V Villa sealed it with an own goal um as for Fulham I mean jenez was a standout again he's now returned in five successive games got the goal here four goals and one assist now in the last five for him could have had an assist as well if it wasn't for pereira's Miss penalty because jnez forced the hand ball could be significant that because it was such a badly taken penalty from Andes Pereira that himz could step in now and take them to ad to his appeal even more 5.7 Fulham have still got good fixtures I mean he looks like he's going a new lease of life which is great to see obviously a for FPL Legend at walls born again at Fulham definitely a consideration with the fixures that Fulham have got and and the confidence they're playing with I don't think this defeat Dilla will be a major setback are we finally going to get to look at some man united attackers maybe I mean it was a a good showing from the front three against brenford run out two- One winners rashford gacho and hland all starting to click maybe or hinting at something uh hland came into the side and did impress he had three shots not 43 one chance created as well got his well taken goal from a lovely Bruno assist only a second Return of the season for Bruno owners there uh I guess gacha was a stand out load 10 shot creation uh involvements in the game week more than any other player that's eight shots and two chances created only .43 xgo it shows you that perhaps the quality of the chance wasn't great but there's potential here we know about garnacho hland needs games and needs consistency but maybe maybe just first shoots of some progress that means we can start to consider United in the future there's five good fixes to come as well so who knows maybe not for me at the moment but one to monitor that's for sure as for brenford they capitalized on delit off the pitch to score from a corner that set piece thre is always there pinnick second goal of the Season uh nothing too much more to talk about really and bumo was kept quiet Vandenberg started it right back again in the four and looks like it could be an option and Visa was back on the bench got 30 minutes at the end good fixure still the next three it s fman bouth Visa at 5.9 could it be Al budget forward option I meant to say fleen got nine saves in that game now he's made more saves 42 than any other keeper Hanson of Leicester is is second and he was involved in a ridiculous game at St Mar's where Leicester run out 3-2 winners having been two-nil down at halim Great result for Steve Cooper side of course disaster for Russell Martins in this game it's Brian nut again who stood out five shots three chances created 1.45 xgi the highest in the game week he started out playing out on the on the right flank then when Fatu came on um everything changed for two really did make an impact very Lively in 31 minutes .51 xgi uh two shots and one chance created he had his Pace really frightened s Anon and helped turn the game around bonan went to a central role number 10 got the first goal back and played a part those two played a part in the comeback and and well it's just tragic for for sa Anon they've as I said made nine errors now six leading to goals the most in the division really look suspect at set plays as well I think it's 5.6 XG conceded at set plays the highest in the league and they got caught right at the end again Rell Martin seems to have a trouble on these Corners he he he piles men into the box but leaves the edge of the Box free and that's what Lester did and they scored the equalizer Assa the winner R IU to go three to up before that Archer got his second in successive games uh and well could could maybe another budget option if you would need to go down to 5 million an intered Manning 4-3 Defender appeared to play left wing um so they had dibling on one flank Manning on the other so he was played out of position but mean while s hun look as brle as they do even on outter position Defender playing up front is not going to tempt us is it super one- nil win for Brighton at Newcastle wellber with his fifth goal of the season um second now only a Harland amongst forwards but did pick up a back injury so that's one to monitor if you're eying out well back for your forward lines um yeah I mean a great a great victory for Brighton they did it without matoma who started on the bench after International Duty that's one to look for herzler obviously looks to give players a rest after interal break so that's worth noting matoma came on though and he's still the standout player amongst that Brighton team for me as for Newcastle well they had plenty of chances they dominated the first half isach had nine shot involvements alog together seven shots two chances created for 0.88 xgi similarly golden four shots three chances created for 0.7 xgi those two we really need to come into form again to give us those options but I mean they've typified Newcastle this season just so erratic no consistency flat deceive and eak really needs to find these shooting boots 8.3 it would be quite something if him and Gordon could come alive again so that's all of Saturday's games covered I've got four players today uh foden Harland captain and Lewis against wolves and then Trent playing Chelsea later I need some points I've only got 14 I think it is with seeno coming off the bench for sacka at the moment so it looks like a miserable game week and a red arrow for me but I'm not alone low scores everywhere it's one of those game weeks I think you did well if you had broken 20 points from Saturday's games as has of course but I don't want to talk about that uh then we've got Forest Palace on Monday night so I might have to do that one from the shed to get this out in time so look out for that but that's all from me now and I'll see you in the morning good morning so Harem blanks for third successive game the first time he's ever done that in his Man City career not only that he had very few touches no shots at all no chances created it's only the third time in his career that he's had a game with zero shots when starting the last time was game we against Arsenal last season so that's it's a long time ago big regression he's had zero big chances in those three blanks where he had 10 big chances in the in the five games before that that shows the aggression for those who wild carded him in and that includes me of course Man City overall just struggled to break walls down I I thought they lacked any penetration from out wide despite playing doku and Savio greish and foden came off the bench to pep it up a little bit but they were they were devoid of ideas got the win of course foden got the assist from the corner from a from the stones header which was perhaps a bit fortuitous given the V check but overall City just huffed and puffed were a bit ploty a bit predictable and struggled um but what do we do we've got to hold fodm we've got to hold Harland we got to hold Lewis we've got to hold gardio ahead of Southampton in game week nine um that is such a plum fixure the way that sa an are playing of course and varol yeah got uh second goal of the Season uh 28 touches in the box now um I think he's just behind a doggy and Lewis for that he continues to be a goal threat and that compensates for the lack of clean sheets that City get in but I don't know um I think I've got to wait until deyne comes back to assess what I do with my man city assets I think foden if he's not going to be a reliable starter and I guess Sunday showed that I might have to think again on him and he might be the one to make way if I'm looking at Palmer [Music] Liverpool got the victory very difficult game against Chelsea uh thought Chelsea did very well but Liverpool got the win in the end Salah with the hall double figure return decimated our ranks that did um only had the two shots two chances created 0.14 ex non penalty but of course got the penalty I think he's first of the season and then the assist for the the Curtis Jones goal uh yeah overall I think think uh I guess the major news elsewhere was Diaz was benched perhaps expected after the international break that's something we got to look for that that slot will do and it kind of puts another question mark over him as a potential asset and then in the game J got injured after half an hour and got replaced by Darwin so he's got an injury now so all of a sudden our options in that Liverpool attack a cut back to maybe just s but oh we going there with Palmer and Harland and and sacka on the list as well son of course so foden I haven't but yeah there's so many Heavy Hitters now demanding of our of those Midfield slots and our money that that Sal has obviously slipped off the the ownership and that's why he's hold did so much damage to us elsewhere Trent is a concern as well maybe he's someone who's going to give way as we look to pursue those Heavy Hitters no chances created in this game he's only created three chances over the last three games had four shots so no xgi from Trent in this game and so you can't blame now people to waiver on him it's Arsenal obviously next which is a difficult game are we going to get anything from Trent then the fixtures do improve after that but given his price and his output at the moment you can't blame people for looking elsewhere uh as for Chelsea parba was kept fairly quiet by Curtis Jones I thought he came out with four shots three in the box .56 xgi and he is top now for midfielders for xgi non penalty so he he's still got to remain a Target despite this being a difficult game for him as I said Curtis Jones did a good job on him in Midfield and Jackson came out of his fifth goal the season um he 5.7 extra non penalty over the season now second only to Harland amongst forwards yeah there could be potential in this Chelsea side beon Palmer um but he's got to remain the key Target surely just ended at the city ground Forest win one- nil good performance and Chris Wood with the winner and let's let's talk about chriswood unbelievable he's now been involved in 62% of forest goals with on the pitch 7 8% shot accuracy 11 of his 16 shots been on target I mean conversion rate of 31% it's just incredible he continues to deliver why don't I have him in my team it's it just seems crazy doesn't it um a one- nil win looks like Sals is going to come out with a maximum bonus though I think he made six saves on the night including two worldies one from eay one from schook did really well um and a clean sheet again I think that's our third clean sheet cheat of the season um yeah really happy with that result uh and from a forest point of view yeah it's wood and SS who the standouts I guess minkovich and Millo clean sheets again Ana I mean yeah any of the back four look options but CS is beginning to look like potentially the four or five keeper to go for which you at one point I thought he wouldn't keep his place but he he's put in performances out the bag now uh and all credit to him um and then Chris Wood yeah up front as you said elsewhere without gives white not a lot in Midfield Anderson played well won a lot of jewels but not a lot of yeah nothing not not fancy potential and E I think he had five shots again only one from inside the Box he's had 32 shots now second only to cenia among midfielders but he just you know he's denied by a couple of Sayes but again it's just it's just not working for Palace is it nothing is going in for e and keto was poor in the first half Mata apparently he's not fit although I don't know how they get ineta and mateta in the same team no they're in trouble I mean they're too good to go down surely but they they're certainly in a fight now um so yeah um a good final game Forest good final game for me from a game week that's been terrible 26 points looks like I'm going down to 2.5 million although there is going to be a change in points because the Premier League today announced that they're going to remove son's assist I think that will drop into one bonus as well so maybe that'll affect my rank as well good decision by the Premier League and really important that they've gone back and corrected that um obviously if you've watched the video you've seen that I yeah I did think that was a wrong decision um and they've come to that conclusion and corrected it and that's big for the game because it means that we can get decisions now that go wrong earlier corrected later in the game week right up until the end of end of the game week an hour after the game week on a Monday night in this occasion so that's really good for the future of the game really good that they've done that right decision I think for the reasons I said still think it's a mistake me not getting son though I still think i' made an eror there um because obviously I would have got some points instead of someo Off the Bench for only a couple and and I think I'm going to end up looking at son for this game week because sacka doesn't look like he was in training today for the European tie against Shaka so I'm gonna have to get rid of sacka and son could be on the menu so I've missed out on the points that he did get this week by doing that just a chain of events on Saturday me not being about enough last week being too busy at work to soak up the team news and and all the info on sacker as I said I've got to get better got to get better than 2.5 million uh I'll be back with blackbox with has later in the week if you enjoyed this video like And subscribe sorry there wasn't too much scenery in there with the weather it was really difficult and I was pushed for time so hopefully when I do the next one the weather's better and I can get more of that in there like I say like And subscribe see you next time,5465,5239,my word i dont know where to begin it was a horrible saturday for fbl and certainly for my fbl team and we got to start with the sacka situation from my perspective i was i was away all week in bulgaria thats why i didnt do the blackbox stream and so i was i had limited time to soak up information and team news and so on i caught some friday night got back that evening land looked at my team on saturday and i was going to roll my transfer u where i stood on saturday i was i was 80 certain that he would start because as we know hes had knocks in the past and the comments from carsle artetta were were positive lets face it so i thought he was i was certainly 8020 thinking he was going to start at bournemouth then i rolled the transfer but i almost wavered so 15 minutes before deadline i saw a tweet from what i thought was a reliable source charles watts which turned out to be boer if you dont know booner account on twitter who posts a troll post to misleading team news as a joke a joke it can be funny to be fair and this was one of his tweets and i fell for it so i put that tweet in the godfather tier chat to try and help people in there that this tweet was out there its public just in case you aint seen it 15 minutes ago sacas not playing i then went to my desk went to take sacker out put son in because it was it was looking like he was going to start he was he was back to fitness and it was a risk worth taking with the fixtures that spurs had and then i looked at whatsapp and there it was as was saying among others that was a boa post and it was fake so i didnt make the transfer cuz i was back to thinking 8020 sacka would start turns out that as saw my post thought it was weird as well made the transfer then realized too late it was a fake one i dont know crazy and then of course didnt turn up and i didnt get son and well talk about son and the assisted a bit but the rest his history of course sacker didnt turn up and then it turns out a load of content creators made last minute changes which im not surprised about im particularly not surprised about because then after the deadline i watched the arsenal fan tv video in which they one of the content creators on there if you can call them that said that sack was a major doubt and wouldnt play now had i seen that before deadline that for me would have made me 5050 no smoke without fire and then i would have made the transfer to song cuz 5050 would be enough for me but i didnt see it i didnt know that but what i can say is if i was among the content creators or other people who saw that in advance of deadline then i would have made that s transfer so i think its fair enough so all these people accusing content creators having secret information i think its pretty unfair because i can only go on what i know i didnt get any secret information and had i seen that arsenal fan tv id have been 5050 and id have made the transfer the song cuz logically it makes sense with this with the fixtures so i can only stand up for that view that it was all open and above board and a logical decision and of course youre going to make the decision late because youre going to wait till the final moment in case you do get a leak in case you do get public information thats going to sway you like sacker scene at the ground so its all understandable but i didnt benefit from it i didnt make the change because i thought he was going to start and i didnt see that arsenal fan tv clip which for me that would have been enough cuz it suggested that there was an itk out there who had information and it would have just tipped me 5050 and i would have made that transfer but anyway i hope i hope thats not a slid indoors moment for my season it has been a terrible game week i went into the arsenal bournemouth game with sacka with cba and with gabrielle celba got the red card sacka didnt turn up and arsenal lost the game 20 celba red card means hes out against liverpool which is a major blow to them in that game and it means that ill probably have to sell celba now with the two tree transfers ive got ahead of the next game week as for bournemouth you mean seeno was a stand out against six shots one chance created hes now had 37 shots 10 more than any other m fielder and in the end they won the game with a training ground set piece played ar at their own game a very good corner and a penalty its now four out clean sheet for arsenal and its liverpool newcastle and chelsea in the next three i think that i dont think im holding sacka its a hamstring injury could he could miss that game i think im going to be moving him out and its going to be ca going as well so with those fixtures and with a dip in form and confidence im definitely moving away from arsenal and then theres the son assist so the way i see it is the error here is on the tributing the own goal to arola because i think once you recognize that its an arola own goal rather than a tbo own goal you recognize that final touch that arola had and then that means that son shot has the initial save from arola ricochet back off to theo then the final touch from marola which was pivotal enough to be cited as a means to give him the own goal so thats three touches the rul say that for an assist to be awarded from an own goal the player awarded the assist has to directly force the own goal now i dont think in this case you can say that because by giving it to aras known goal were recognizing that his touch is a significant one presumably toos touch back towards goal wasnt on target and it was aras final touch that b it to b it to be a goal so therefore sunshot didnt directly lead to that go it was toos touch back the ricochet off too from the save the initial save mariola which was what forced the own goal the finals hch from marola therefore for me its no assist now had it been a tobo own goal id be more sympathetic i think it would be an assist then because for me the sun shop would force to save the ricochet off to debo and in but because theyve said arola a goal theyve recognize that third touch i dont think we can say son directly cost it therefore its no assist for me and there is presidents here if you go back to 2022 first game of the season man utd ball comes off the back of dow towards the bright and goal sanchez saves it onto mallister but mallister knocks the ball in for an own goal to mallister no assist was given to dow even though dows touch was sending the ball goldw and it was sanchez who saved it onto mall but no assist was given to dow he didnt benefit because presumably they felt that dows touch didnt force the own goal cuz mallister got the own goal and it was sanchezs save which forced the own goal but its the same here its tobos touch back the ricochet back to arola that forces the own goal therefore to be consistent with that incident in 2022 its no assist now whats crazy is it was no assist and then at 900 for some reason an assist was added and a tweet went out the tweet was later removed because there was a lot of negative reaction to it i stayed out of that but i just dont see it can be awarded assist if youre going to be consistent with what was gone before theres another incident the gapbo incident from last year against west ham arola own goal again ironically he had a shot that was off target but that doesnt matter the shot came off of ogbon onto such on the line and off of arola for an own goal arola own goal then as well nothing was given to gpo because his shot didnt directly forc the own goal from mariola if anything it was suchs touch on the line which forced the own goal so its the same again son shot didnt directly force the own goal because it was a touch back the ricochet off tobo that made arola score the own goal because it was credited to him now i dont think it should have been credited to him i think thats the mistake and in that case it would have been an assist in my book but arola and goal no assist for me as for the game itself son came out with a goal and assist came out with 047 xgi five shots two chances created a decent game you look good in spells but it was johnson who came out with a top xgi 93 overall five shots all in the box again looked to threet and its just that shot volume in the box that intrigues me hes had 26 shots this season all of them in the penalty area and in the end that volume thats got to offer value going forward madison has been a consideration but he won off at halim tactical decision by an to bring sa on and that was the trigger for the turnaround in the second half and spurs just blew west ham away so johnson continues to catch the eye i may go him over son of a bit more time this week if i if it is sacka who does make way ahead of liverpool game depending of whether sacka turns up for midweek european game of course the other player to talk about here sanky concerning just one shot one chance created had a look at the average position maps he was the deepest of all the spurs attacker so ahead so with madison kuresi johnson and son all four of them ahead of salanki in terms of the touches the average touches that they had on the pitch and you can see it with the it test he was coming deep he was linking play runners getting beyond him he wasnt getting the end of things that as i said one shot one chance thats not enough 012 xgi is a concern im already thinking that despite the fixtures i dont know if hes going to deliver the volume of points that i need from him and moveing havs after arsenals fixtures soften up a bit might be the way to go i think as for west ham i know two more players i want to is porro and a doggy went forward and pouring forward loads porro in particular scares me not having him he had for shots and two chances created on the day a doggy three chances created and got the assist but porro for me is the eye catcher 16 shots now the top amongst defenders this season that volume has got to pay off even without clean sheets i think hes a player that we need to keep on our adars and i think with the fixtures that spurs have got i may well be moving cba down to him depending on how the budget goes for me west ham now kudos got the goal well taken but then got the red card so hes out for three games and thats painful for west h because their fixtures are better now but theyre going to miss kudos who is is a big outlet for them bowen could have got the assist his cross to kudos did take a def flection and it did look as though it was intended for antonio i can see why it wasnt given harsh low for boeing owners those brave enough to go for the differential missing out on points again and we kidos out i just think that bo and ro remain a very lowly owned differential so everton won 2n at portman road a big fixture for it which they i found wanting i starting to fear for them i did have some good feelings about the liks of the lap and davis going into a better fixture run but 389 now is their xg for the season its the lowest in the division by quite a margin davis came out with three chances created and he does have 20 chances created for the season more than any other defender but i just see them scoring enough goals for him to convert that into assists dap has got four goals and he came out with a couple of shots in this game but i think it 018 his xg and davis was 023 just too low and everton had too much for him in midfield and they cope well of them at the back and in the end ran out at a caner for them calvin le was the stand out in terms of xgi 132 he had five shots in the game big frustration for calv l owners that he came out of a blank he had a couple of oneon ones which m did well with but cav l should have profited m neil got an assist now created 25 chances for the season second only to sacker amongst midfielders so he continues to offer value kean got the other goal he could be an option at the back but bran freight is near in fitness mikeno would be the better option he came back in to the side at left back did play deep didnt get forward too much but at 43 hes got to be worth a look now that everton fixes continued to be decent pford low backtoback clean sheets is e the answer for those who dont have ryar or for those who are giving up on ry after asked on conceding goals certainly its a good its a good couple of game weeks for pford and everton and suddenly theyre starting to look like they could be a source of value to us as well andai got the goal but it was some an error hes another one we could keep an eye on as a cheap forward option and again just going back to itwi they did make errors nine errors now for the season the most of any team its level with sampton and those defensive errors coupled with the fact they cant score goals could take them down half fought victory for villa at craen cottage rogers came in with his third goal in the season could have had more mr sitter before half time and came out with three shots 88 xgi which the pass watkins 41 he got his goal over and just two shots smartly taken header from matans corner and then v villa sealed it with an own goal as for fulham jenez was a standout again hes now returned in five successive games got the goal here four goals and one assist now in the last five for him could have had an assist as well if it wasnt for pereiras miss penalty because jnez forced the hand ball could be significant that because it was such a badly taken penalty from andes pereira that himz could step in now and take them to ad to his appeal even more 57 fulham have still got good fixtures he looks like hes going a new lease of life which is great to see a for fpl legend at walls born again at fulham definitely a consideration with the fixures that fulham have got and the confidence theyre playing with i dont think this defeat dilla will be a major setback are we finally going to get to look at some man united attackers maybe it was a good showing from the front three against brenford run out two one winners rashford gacho and hland all starting to click maybe or hinting at something hland came into the side and did impress he had three shots not 43 one chance created as well got his well taken goal from a lovely bruno assist only a second return of the season for bruno owners there gacha was a stand out load 10 shot creation involvements in the game week more than any other player thats eight shots and two chances created only 43 xgo it shows you that perhaps the quality of the chance wasnt great but theres potential here we know about garnacho hland needs games and needs consistency but maybe just first shoots of some progress that means we can start to consider united in the future theres five good fixes to come as well so who knows maybe not for me at the moment but one to monitor thats for sure as for brenford they capitalized on delit off the pitch to score from a corner that set piece thre is always there pinnick second goal of the season nothing too much more to talk about and bumo was kept quiet vandenberg started it right back again in the four and looks like it could be an option and visa was back on the bench got 30 minutes at the end good fixure still the next three it s fman bouth visa at 59 could it be al budget forward option i meant to say fleen got nine saves in that game now hes made more saves 42 than any other keeper hanson of leicester is second and he was involved in a ridiculous game at st mars where leicester run out 32 winners having been twonil down at halim great result for steve cooper side of course disaster for russell martins in this game its brian nut again who stood out five shots three chances created 145 xgi the highest in the game week he started out playing out on the on the right flank then when fatu came on everything changed for two did make an impact very lively in 31 minutes 51 xgi two shots and one chance created he had his pace frightened s anon and helped turn the game around bonan went to a central role number 10 got the first goal back and played a part those two played a part in the comeback and well its just tragic for sa anon theyve as i said made nine errors now six leading to goals the most in the division look suspect at set plays as well i think its 56 xg conceded at set plays the highest in the league and they got caught right at the end again rell martin seems to have a trouble on these corners he piles men into the box but leaves the edge of the box free and thats what lester did and they scored the equalizer assa the winner r iu to go three to up before that archer got his second in successive games and well could maybe another budget option if you would need to go down to 5m an intered manning 43 defender appeared to play left wing so they had dibling on one flank manning on the other so he was played out of position but mean while s hun look as brle as they do even on outter position defender playing up front is not going to tempt us is it super one nil win for brighton at newcastle wellber with his fifth goal of the season second now only a harland amongst forwards but did pick up a back injury so thats one to monitor if youre eying out well back for your forward lines a great a great victory for brighton they did it without matoma who started on the bench after international duty thats one to look for herzler looks to give players a rest after interal break so thats worth noting matoma came on though and hes still the standout player amongst that brighton team for me as for newcastle well they had plenty of chances they dominated the first half isach had nine shot involvements alog together seven shots two chances created for 088 xgi similarly golden four shots three chances created for 07 xgi those two we need to come into form again to give us those options but theyve typified newcastle this season just so erratic no consistency flat deceive and eak needs to find these shooting boots 83 it would be quite something if him and gordon could come alive again so thats all of saturdays games covered ive got four players today foden harland captain and lewis against wolves and then trent playing chelsea later i need some points ive only got 14 i think it is with seeno coming off the bench for sacka at the moment so it looks like a miserable game week and a red arrow for me but im not alone low scores everywhere its one of those game weeks i think you did well if you had broken 20 points from saturdays games as has of course but i dont want to talk about that then weve got forest palace on monday night so i might have to do that one from the shed to get this out in time so look out for that but thats all from me now and ill see you in the morning good morning so harem blanks for third successive game the first time hes ever done that in his man city career not only that he had very few touches no shots at all no chances created its only the third time in his career that hes had a game with zero shots when starting the last time was game we against arsenal last season so thats its a long time ago big regression hes had zero big chances in those three blanks where he had 10 big chances in the in the five games before that shows the aggression for those who wild carded him in and that includes me of course man city overall just struggled to break walls down i thought they lacked any penetration from out wide despite playing doku and savio greish and foden came off the bench to pep it up a little bit but they were they were devoid of ideas got the win of course foden got the assist from the corner from a from the stones header which was perhaps a bit fortuitous given the v check but overall city just huffed and puffed were a bit ploty a bit predictable and struggled but what do we do weve got to hold fodm weve got to hold harland we got to hold lewis weve got to hold gardio ahead of southampton in game week nine that is such a plum fixure the way that sa an are playing of course and varol got second goal of the season 28 touches in the box now i think hes just behind a doggy and lewis for that he continues to be a goal threat and that compensates for the lack of clean sheets that city get in but i dont know i think ive got to wait until deyne comes back to assess what i do with my man city assets i think foden if hes not going to be a reliable starter and sunday showed that i might have to think again on him and he might be the one to make way if im looking at palmer liverpool got the victory very difficult game against chelsea thought chelsea did very well but liverpool got the win in the end salah with the hall double figure return decimated our ranks that did only had the two shots two chances created 014 ex non penalty but of course got the penalty i think hes first of the season and then the assist for the curtis jones goal overall i think the major news elsewhere was diaz was benched perhaps expected after the international break thats something we got to look for that slot will do and it puts another question mark over him as a potential asset and then in the game j got injured after half an hour and got replaced by darwin so hes got an injury now so all of a sudden our options in that liverpool attack a cut back to maybe just s but we going there with palmer and harland and sacka on the list as well son of course so foden i havent but theres so many heavy hitters now demanding of our of those midfield slots and our money that sal has slipped off the ownership and thats why hes hold did so much damage to us elsewhere trent is a concern as well maybe hes someone whos going to give way as we look to pursue those heavy hitters no chances created in this game hes only created three chances over the last three games had four shots so no xgi from trent in this game and so you cant blame now people to waiver on him its arsenal next which is a difficult game are we going to get anything from trent then the fixtures do improve after that but given his price and his output at the moment you cant blame people for looking elsewhere as for chelsea parba was kept fairly quiet by curtis jones i thought he came out with four shots three in the box 56 xgi and he is top now for midfielders for xgi non penalty so hes still got to remain a target despite this being a difficult game for him as i said curtis jones did a good job on him in midfield and jackson came out of his fifth goal the season he 57 extra non penalty over the season now second only to harland amongst forwards there could be potential in this chelsea side beon palmer but hes got to remain the key target surely just ended at the city ground forest win one nil good performance and chris wood with the winner and lets lets talk about chriswood unbelievable hes now been involved in 62 of forest goals with on the pitch 7 8 shot accuracy 11 of his 16 shots been on target conversion rate of 31 its just incredible he continues to deliver why dont i have him in my team its it just seems crazy doesnt it a one nil win looks like sals is going to come out with a maximum bonus though i think he made six saves on the night including two worldies one from eay one from schook did well and a clean sheet again i think thats our third clean sheet cheat of the season happy with that result and from a forest point of view its wood and ss who the standouts minkovich and millo clean sheets again ana any of the back four look options but cs is beginning to look like potentially the four or five keeper to go for which you at one point i thought he wouldnt keep his place but hes put in performances out the bag now and all credit to him and then chris wood up front as you said elsewhere without gives white not a lot in midfield anderson played well won a lot of jewels but not a lot of nothing not fancy potential and e i think he had five shots again only one from inside the box hes had 32 shots now second only to cenia among midfielders but he just hes denied by a couple of sayes but again its just its just not working for palace is it nothing is going in for e and keto was poor in the first half mata apparently hes not fit although i dont know how they get ineta and mateta in the same team no theyre in trouble theyre too good to go down surely but theyre certainly in a fight now so a good final game forest good final game for me from a game week thats been terrible 26 points looks like im going down to 25m although there is going to be a change in points because the premier league today announced that theyre going to remove sons assist i think that will drop into one bonus as well so maybe thatll affect my rank as well good decision by the premier league and important that theyve gone back and corrected that if youve watched the video youve seen that i i did think that was a wrong decision and theyve come to that conclusion and corrected it and thats big for the game because it means that we can get decisions now that go wrong earlier corrected later in the game week right up until the end of end of the game week an hour after the game week on a monday night in this occasion so thats good for the future of the game good that theyve done that right decision i think for the reasons i said still think its a mistake me not getting son though i still think i made an eror there because i would have got some points instead of someo off the bench for only a couple and i think im going to end up looking at son for this game week because sacka doesnt look like he was in training today for the european tie against shaka so im gonna have to get rid of sacka and son could be on the menu so ive missed out on the points that he did get this week by doing that just a chain of events on saturday me not being about enough last week being too busy at work to soak up the team news and all the info on sacker as i said ive got to get better got to get better than 25m ill be back with blackbox with has later in the week if you enjoyed this video like and subscribe sorry there wasnt too much scenery in there with the weather it was difficult and i was pushed for time so hopefully when i do the next one the weathers better and i can get more of that in there like i say like and subscribe see you next time
12,FPLFocal,h156zwBm1F8,FPL GW9 EXPERTS TEAM 🚀 TRIPLE CAPTAIN ACTIVE!,2024-10-24T11:44:08Z,welcome back for another video we've got a great experts video lined up this week I don't think we've ever had so many different chips active in one game week if you're new to this series every week we look at data from hundreds of top FPL managers many of the best FPL managers that have ever played the game including their transfer plans captaincy chip usage and the experts team hit subscribe to follow this throughout the season let's get into it a very quick manager highlight to kick things off them hcar finished on a very respectable 49 points in an otherwise lows scoring game league and he sits top of the expert League ranked 4.4k no one's even close to him at the moment so we'll move straight on well done ascar so let's break down what they're up to of their transfers to gaming n this week just 28% the roll on the transfer 34% making one transfer 25% making two and 11% making three transfers there's one wild cut active this week as well which we'll take a look at later there's actually one free hit active this week as well more than that in a minute so a ton of transfer activity who are the most popular buyers and sells by the experts this week the most bought player is Palmer 38% of picking him up before Newcastle home which means the most sold player is sacka exactly 50% of sold before they face Liverpool home on paper Palmer home to Newcastle isn't upgrade on sacka home to Liverpool Liverpool have got less expected goals conceded than any team Fest goals ConEd the most clean sheet plus of course zaker is flagged now what we do know is he wasn't in the Champions League Squad midweek however that could have just been a case of saving him for the weekend as Arsenal squad on paper is more than good enough to get a result against shakar which they did without him the there was a tweet from Sam C reports which said he's expected to be available for the Liverpool game having trained already pending any last minute changes or niggles so given sacka is not necessarily a bad play at all however 22% of bought Sun most of those are sacka Sellers as well big picture Palmer's an extremely long-term hold if you're buying this week this is his fixture run all the way till gamei 27 whereas Sun makes a bit more sense as a 3-we play for palis Villa and then IP switch before he's got Man City in gamei 12 where you can look to switch sacker or saler in 15% of sold havocs this week with the most popular Replacements being himz 18% to bought him then CA 5% vissa 4% now Jimenez has been incredible form recently he's returned in all of his last five games in the league with four goals one assist and they've got a nice block of four victores ahead Everton brenford Palace and walls only 5.7 mil it's an immense fixture for brenford this week as well home to IP switch Sephora experts are moving early in Vista he was back from injury last match coming off the bench and obviously did very well in the early game mix in the season before getting injured perhaps not guaranteed of a start this week having only just returned but there's a good chance he does he's also got solid running games where he can leave him in for a good five or so game weeks 6% of bought foden who did score man City's 5 and0 win in the Champions League of course he was benched last game we further to that though pep says that Gish is out of action for 7 to 10 days with doku out for even longer so he's got to be nailed on for a start and it's Southampton home as well 5% of B vardal who could also benefit from those injuries perhaps with some license to get get four down the Left Flank 133% of Sol Trent ahead of the Arsenal game make no mistake he's still an incredible pick he's a top scoring Defender the best defense so far this season he's got Brighton home Villa home and Southampton away after Arsenal however many experts have taken him down to a cheap Defender to help fund Palmer eight nor has been picked up by 18% now we could see wolves using a back three with eight Nori playing really Advanced down the left wing and W still have the best long-term fixures of any team now and their bad run is behind them at least another one took consider his penz he's 4 and 1 half mil the center back's got two goals in two games he's got good clean sheet Oz this week against IP switch let's move on to chip usage then and I can't remember this happening before in the series but maybe it has done we've got three different chips active in one week one wild card one free hit and 10% triple Captain him so which one should we start with let's go for the wild card first FPL sh's pulled the trigger here's his wild card team s and lumbley who his Keepers in defense he's got Gabriel Burgess vardal mikeno and a Nori in Midfield he's got Rogers bumo foden Palmer and Johnson and his front three is himz Harland and kuna here's what he had to say I decided to wild card finally after cba's red card having no bench or three transfers I'm going with the triple city after Pep's comments last night about injuries Etc foden feels like a no-rain now vardal Stones Le is still up for debate though Palmer's a log is one of the main reasons for the Wild Card getting the two woles players with an incredible run of fixtures as well and going with the quality in the pens of kuna instead of Lon getting Johnson is my spurs asset as I don't believe Sun's worth 3 mil more started the season with seller and although I didn't want to sell him I'm building a plan to get him back in two to three game weeks if I don't go with foden after all the money will go to Watkins instead and Ral becomes Bon not instead of foden Ral first Sub in this draft to come in when Rogers or CA have a tough fixture so what about the free hit then now ordinarily the free hit's always been used in the blank or double gaming but this season we have seen chips used in single game Maks much like the triple Captain this week and due to only two expected game is much later in the season you can't make the case for using a chip in the single game if it makes sense for your team FB cre looking to use his free hit this week and his current draft is fakening goal pinck Duncan Lewis in defense bumo Rogers fod and Palmer in Midfield wood Harland and Welbeck up top here's what you had to say the decision is pretty much that in my opinion the free hit has a slightly lesser value due to one less big double gaming this season and with wild card one not yet activated I'm planning to activate it in gamei 18 I'm hoping I can navigate the gamei follow without the free hit I've also got a slight Harem fomo as he's not in my team I have Salah instead who I have back in gamei 10 I've got no Palmer foden either and double Aral defense against Liverpool I didn't activate it just yet though there are still a few players up in the air fod and Welbeck Etc but the free hit is pretty much triple City double Brighton triple brenford and Palmer and wood this team might need some slight changes with well Becker d i could switch to 352 lastly the triple Captain with 10% going for it this week Ben's one of those managers going for it his team is Sanchez and goal he's got viio mikeno Trent foden Palmer seeno bumo Vista harand and salanki it's an insane team and on top of that his triple Captain is activated here's what he had to say I'm using the triple captain ship in Harem this week as I think he stands a very good chance of a huge hul usually I'd keep the triple Captain for a double game me but seeing as we are expecting fewer of those this season I'm happy to use it now I'd rather prioritize my bench boosts and free hit for the double game mix we do get as I see them as generally being more effective than the triple captaincy Southampton at home feels like the perfect fixture of a city Southampton are a team that likes to try to play but unlikely to park the bus the coach is also under a lot of pressure and as a team they must be reeling after they surrendered a two-o lead at home to Leicester last week and end up losing 3-2 the last place you want to go after a result like that as the yetti had all in all it looks like a great opportunity for Harland I'm not put off by his three blanks and roow previously in the league he's been scoring in European games and he's bound to get plenty of chances against southampton's shaky defense really I'm looking for him to score at at least the braid for the chip to feel like it's been a success that seems very achievable this week Elsewhere on my team I had fre free transfers and I'm using them all to bring in vardal foden and Visa viio starting to look like the Fantastic FB asset he was towards the end of last season and he's a player that I plan to be my team long term foden is a short-term pun he hasn't played many minutes yet this season but expect that to change now his fit and see his next four fixures look really good from an attacking point of view vissa was just back from injury last game we and he came off the bench so he's a minute risk this week but given how important he is to the team I think he'll start brenford have a great run of games for the next five and Visa had three goals and an assist in the first four matches before his injury at 5.9 mil I'm anticipating he'll be the best budget forward in the game over the next month or so and I'm going for him now to get the plum hiip switch fixture thanks for sending in J and good luck with the chips this week moving on to experts captaincy and we'll keep it short and sweet cuz 100% of the experts a captain in Harland not one bit dissuaded by those three consecutive blanks it's actually the first time that man City's fa to score in three games in a row everything points towards him being the best choice if you got him he's top of the goal scorer odds he got brace M week in the Champions League before coming off a little early ahead of the Southampton fixture and FP review has come comfortably top this week with 9.1 points Palmer in second if you've got him and not Harland and foden's close behind on 6.7 so he's a shout and iuma 6.4 and that brings us to The Experts team for gami N9 if you do appreciate the time that goes into each of these videos hit subscribe and drop a like on the video there has been a change to the team it's Ryan goal it's Trent mikeno and Lewis at the back it's boomo Palmer Rogers and Johnson the Midfield harand cavaler and salanki up top we've got fansy Gabrielle seanu and Greaves on the bench so there's some bench depth here Gabrielle versus Trent is a pretty tight call this week it could be a low scoring game in honesty but celba suspension plus the possible Calif Fury and Timber injuries might nud it trenway if you've got both let us know who you're starting so looking at the experts ownership percentages harland's The Joint most owned in the game a 97% ownership among the expert so how is he 100% captained I noticed there was a bit of confusion in the comments last week so just to explain the small difference here every week we don't always hear from every single participant there's always some that can't understandably so there could be a couple of Harland non-owners that haven't responded this week the ownership percentages are from last week's ownership as well cuz it's basically impossible to project the ownership percentages accurately for the next game me so it's always possible that one or two of buying this week as well not represented certainly Creed he on his free here however the experts team does factor in the track of was made and this week sackers dropped out the team in favor of Palmer given the 50% sold sacka and 38% bought Palmer on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gami 9 here's what they to say this week royal blue FPL has sold havit and Johnson for Strand lson and foden and he says I know many have jumped on him already but foden's ownership is still only 6.6% as of Wednesday night I'm expecting that to sky rocket in the coming weeks initiated by a hall against Southampton I hope Guido patista says I'm looking to get Palmer and a 4.5 mil Defender this week 8 Nori pinck on minkovich for sacker and Tren I'll then use that money to get salon next week from Diaz by also downgrading cavat L into a 4.5 mil forward that will give me a salad Palmer and harand team which I'm happy with moving forward Flair player says now the planning really kicks in you need to decide what premiums you want and when you want them they could be big swings so you can't be emotional with your transfers FB Spaceman says I'm beginning to think that Michel artetta has not been entirely honest in his press conferences and last Jason flemon says just remember folks as brutal as the opening eight gamix have been there's still 30 more gamic left for it to get a whole lot worse thanks very much for

game we further to that though pep says that gish is out of action for 7 to 10 days with doku out for even longer so hes got to be nailed on for a start and its southampton home as well 5 of b vardal

scoring defender the best defense so far this season hes got brighton home villa home and southampton away after arsenal however many experts have taken him down to a cheap defender to help fund

week and his current draft is fakening goal pinck duncan lewis in defense bumo rogers fod and palmer in midfield wood harland and welbeck up top heres what you had to say the decision is pretty much that in my opinion the free hit has a slightly lesser value due to one less big double gaming this season and with wild card one not yet activated im planning to activate it in gamei 18 im hoping i can navigate the gamei follow without the free hit ive also got a slight harem fomo as hes not in my team i have salah instead who i have back in gamei 10 ive got no palmer foden either and double aral defense against liverpool i didnt activate it just yet though there are still a few players up in the air fod and welbeck etc but the free hit is pretty much triple city double brighton triple brenford and palmer and wood this team might need some slight changes with well becker d i could switch to 352 lastly the triple captain with 10 going for it this week bens one of those managers going for it his team is sanchez and goal hes got viio mikeno trent foden palmer seeno bumo vista harand and salanki its an insane team and on top of that his triple captain is activated heres what he had to say im using the triple captain ship in harem this week as i think he stands a very good chance of a huge hul usually id keep the triple captain for a double game me but seeing as we are expecting fewer of those this season im happy to use it now id rather prioritize my bench boosts and free hit for the double game mix we do get as i see them as generally being more effective than the triple captaincy southampton at home feels like the perfect fixture of a city southampton are a team that likes to try to play but unlikely to park the bus the coach is also under a lot of pressure and as a team they must be reeling after they surrendered a twoo lead at home to leicester last week and end up losing 32 the last place you want to go after a result like that as the yetti had all in all it looks like a great opportunity for harland im not put off by his three blanks and roow previously in the league hes been scoring in european games and hes bound to get plenty of chances against southamptons shaky defense im looking for him to score at least the braid for the chip to feel like its been a success that seems very achievable this week elsewhere on my team i had fre free transfers and im using them all to bring in vardal foden and visa viio starting to look like the fantastic fb asset he was towards the end of last season and hes a player that i plan to be my team long term foden is a shortterm pun he hasnt played many minutes yet this season but expect that to change now his fit and see his next four fixures look good from an attacking point of view vissa was just back from injury last game we and he came off the bench so hes a minute risk this week but given how important he is to the team i think hell start brenford have a great run of games for the next five and visa had three goals and an assist in the first four matches before his injury at 59 mil im anticipating hell be the best budget forward in the game over the next month or so and im going for him now to get the plum hiip switch fixture thanks for sending in j and good luck with the chips this week moving on to experts captaincy and well keep it short and sweet cuz 100 of the experts a captain in harland not one bit dissuaded by those three consecutive blanks its the first time that man citys fa to score in three games in a row everything points towards him being the best choice if you got him hes top of the goal scorer odds he got brace m week in the champions league before coming off a little early ahead of the southampton fixture and fp review has come comfortably top this week with 91 points palmer in second if youve got him and not harland and fodens close behind on 67 so hes a shout and iuma 64 and that brings us to the experts team for gami n9 if you do appreciate the time that goes into each of these videos hit subscribe and drop a like on the video there has been a change to the team its ryan goal its trent mikeno and lewis at the back its boomo palmer rogers and johnson the midfield harand cavaler and salanki up top weve got fansy gabrielle seanu and greaves on the bench so theres some bench depth here gabrielle versus trent is a pretty tight call this week it could be a low scoring game in honesty but celba suspension plus the possible calif fury and timber injuries might nud it trenway if youve got both let us know who youre starting so looking at the experts ownership percentages harlands the joint most owned in the game a 97 ownership among the expert so how is he 100 captained i noticed there was a bit of confusion in the comments last week so just to explain the small difference here every week we dont always hear from every single participant theres always some that cant understandably so there could be a couple of harland nonowners that havent responded this week the ownership percentages are from last weeks ownership as well cuz its impossible to project the ownership percentages accurately for the next game me so its always possible that one or two of buying this week as well not represented certainly creed he on his free here however the experts team does factor in the track of was made and this week sackers dropped out the team in favor of palmer given the 50 sold sacka and 38 bought palmer on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gami 9 heres what they to say this week royal blue fpl has sold havit and johnson for strand lson and foden and he says i know many have jumped on him already but fodens ownership is still only 66 as of wednesday night im expecting that to sky rocket in the coming weeks initiated by a hall against southampton i hope guido patista says im looking to get palmer and a 45 mil defender this week 8 nori pinck on minkovich for sacker and tren ill then use that money to get salon next week from diaz by also downgrading cavat l into a 45 mil forward that will give me a salad palmer and harand team which im happy with moving forward flair player says now the planning kicks in you need to decide what premiums you want and when you want them they could be big swings so you cant be emotional with your transfers fb spaceman says im beginning to think that michel artetta has not been entirely honest in his press conferences and last jason flemon says just remember folks as brutal as the opening eight gamix have been theres still 30 more gamic left for it to get a whole lot worse thanks for watching and if you appreciate the time that goes into these videos hit subscribe and drop the video like see you soon for the next one
14,FPLFocal,b3kptzAt-nI,MY FPL GW9 TEAM SELECTION | SAKA OUT ❌,2024-10-23T12:10:55Z,welcome back for another video so gamei 9's just around the corner got a lot to digest this week and I've got some tracks and moves to consider with saaka currently flagged how did you all get on last gamei let us know in the comments we'll start off with a quick review of the gamei and then we'll have a look at some of your biggest highs and lows of last gamei followed up by my team selection and the transfer plans it was a pretty disappointing game M 31 points all out blanks from Riya Trent porro Gabrielle LS boomo Johnson salanki and obviously Haren captain in other words Rogers and wood the two Heroes that actually put up any points admittedly I got a bit lucky as well Auto subs and Rogers coming on for sacka I was somewhat surprised to see sacka not in the squad at all but perhaps a reminder to take everything artetta says with a huge pinch of Soul a hot debate this week cuz wether some had some inside news on sackur as well and we held it well I kept sacka expecting him to start so I certainly had no idea I would have bought foden or Palmer given I've got triple spars already I would say though sacka to some was a perfectly logical move regardless and I would be surprised if a small group was gatekeeping information the risk and getting courau there's too massive I rarely get sent early team leads myself personally and if I do I'll just share it I'm not sure if many of you care about all that stuff but I thought I'd weigh in putting all that aside it was a hotly debated game with the sun assist given tweeted by official FPL then the Tweet deleted and then Sunday night followed up by another tweet saying they'd made a mistake and given it in the first place you think it was the correct decision or a mistake if you missed the sun goal it was a sun shot saved by arola and then it hit to Debo then it hit arola again to take it back on target hence no assist I personally felt they got got one that right and I suppose it's good to note that they changed the rules this season so that points are now finalized on the final day of the game weag there could be other occasions this season where you get some goals or assist points given the next day which wasn't initially given had this been last season those points would have been locked in on Saturday night despite a poor score I'm actually very happy with my team I can't really fult the players I've picked and that's just how the game weeks go sometimes it wouldn't be surprising if a team that scores 20 or 30 or so points last game we goes on to get 70 the next game week that's often what happens let's have a look at your biggest highs and lows of the game as well next Alex Volo triple Captain Harland very unfortunate and he's photoshopped an L Over the Sea here I guess to reflect how he shortly feels after that one six points a tale of two sides here Adriana got keen's 14 points at Auto subed off her bench while Tommy says my highest scoring player is second on the bench he didn't get so lucky another chip disaster FPL Simpson says accidentally bench boosted two players of a combined value of 8.3 million he says no idea how it happened happened but I'm in 100 pound ahead mini league he bench boosted mik Leno and vanderberg for seven points on the bench could have been worse I suppose further chip disasters FPL dun says I had loads of yellow flags and doubts following the international break I free hit away from a team that had Watkins Rogers SS and Salah I bought in CBA who got minus three Ryan Gabriel Rico Lewis foden Gordon Johnson salanki who all pretty much blanked or Worse finished on 21 points the old team would have had 42 points Kareem sent his team and these are all Brutal by the way there's a bit of a trend here he says no returns he got minus three from CBA the only return is last on his bench when Everton finally played good he finished on 19 points it was one of those gamei wasn't it I'm hoping the next game we get some great scores back in again did anyone have a good gamei well just a few sent some good ones in this week so we'll finish of Yeti P he got 72 points and he had returns from Sals Ana Salah Captain son Rogers and Watkins and on top of that he's up to 148 in the world so that's that done let's get into my team for game9 and transfer plans in goal it's ryer it's pretty remarkable that he's kept no clean sheets home to Leicester and Southampton and their B away so I'm sorry to Riot owners that had him before I think I broke him getting on the wild card for that run further to that it's a horrendous fixture this week facing Liverpool at the Emirates CBA suspended cury off injured with a possible knee injury in the Champions League Timber still injured and potentially out again so it could be a back line of something like zenko or kir or left back Gabriel and white center back and party right back it's just not worth spending a keeper transfer in my opinion here transfers are too precious and there are other changes in the team I'm looking to make which are more of a priority perhaps some good news for Lewis owners Walker's got a knee issue and he's not in the Champions League Squad so he's a doubt for the weekend again still not a guarantee of Lewis's minutes of course pep could line up without Lewis and Walker if he wants to it's the stand up fixure this week though playing at the SD head home to Southampton Man City comfortably top of the clean sheet probabilties with 52% chance next high is Brighton 36% and then brenford 34% as it stands I'm playing Trent over Gabrielle this one's quite tight you either hedge your bets and go for both or you can go all in on Arsenal and start double defense the injuries and obviously the ca red nudges me Trent's way though I am considering a Defender transfer this week which would see Trent drop to the bench I'm Keen to keep hold of Trent though for those fishes after arsenal when he's got Brighton home V home Southampton away lastly Pedro porro who took more shots than any defender in the league last season and his 16 shots this season is currently a more than anyone else four more than anyone Gabriel and T have taken 12 par has taken 16 vard and Diaz have taken 10 he's registered 1.77 expected goal of on so he's showing promise I just need him to chip in with an attacking return to help towards a rank swing upwards Spurs play way to Palace and they've been given a 29% chance of a clean sheet this week it's a 343 for gami 9 in Midfield it's sacka Johnson Boomer and Rogers so let's talk about saaka first then what do we do with him he's been upgraded to an orange flag or downgraded 25% chance of playing oddly carsley indicated over the international break that he could have played in their second game which was well over a week ago now but he said it was unfair to risk him and Aleta said he was hopeful he'd make the Bournemouth game what we do know is he wasn't in the Champions League Squad as Arsenal beat sha to 1 nil so is he simply saving him for the Liverpool game as it stands I'm looking to sell him roll that in the transfer plans later Rogers was outstanding in the Champions League midweek what a player he should be nowhere near the England under 21s I can understand emy's frustration there when he gets CAU up every time Viller have enjoyed a great start to this season which he has played a part in they're currently four five wins two draw one loss 2.93 expected G of for Rogers for comparison Sun's on 2.96 J are just above on 3.06 it's a home fixure this week as well as Villa host Bournemouth Johnson's goal scoring streak finally coming to an end last game then a brutal watch as a triple Spurs owner myself with none of my three picks involved in any of the four goals we had a golden chance header which was loed and he put a shot narrowly wide as well he actually created two chances against West Ham and he took five shots in the Box in total it does have the feeling of a potential breakout season for him and bumo gets the vice captaincy this week it's a great looking fixure home to whip switch whove conceded 17.4 expected goals this season which ranks Rock Bottom in the league just behind Southampton on 17.25 XGC it was great to see vissa back in the squad as well after his injury we hadn't seen him since game four bumo managed to chip in returns in his absence but let's not forget what great partnership the two are V could actually be a serious differ for R to consider he's only 2.2% owned and he's 5.9 mil it's hard to look past wood right now but V has got the better longer term fixtures onto the front three then which is wood sank and Harland is this a week to consider triple captain in Harland looking at the data Man City projected 3.35 goals by the market which is the joint highest this season of all teams it switch at home was actually the other one where he course got hatrick against IP switch the other side of the coin though is this no rodri no KD B in the squad rodri wasn't involved when he got that first hat trick against I switch KD B was for Game MC n Man City going to have neither them in the team I do think it's a valid week and I did say last week that we talk about it now and I saw this as the better week than the last one we did have a really poor game against wolves though one of the worst games I've seen him play I'm going to think it over the rest of this week as it stands I'm saving it ordinarily this wouldn't be much of a conversation in previous Seasons but as a reminder due to the FA Cup schedule changes there's two expected double game weeks but we've got triple Captain free hit bench boost and possibly the mystery chip to use in the double game week so that's four chips for two weeks possibly obviously the free hit can work in the blank gamic as well hence you could make the case a triple captain in a fixture like Man City home to Southampton and use it in a single gamei it's certainly work for those used in gameing 2 and even three I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one drop a comment below sh them what you think so harand tops the goal scor o with a 57% Chance of scoring anytime soank is on 34% for the palace game if we filter the last five gameing since sanki returned from injury his underlying numbers been really good 3.65 xgr which ranks fifth highest of all players and second highest among fors after jimnez himz was someone that we really should have discussed in the players divide video he's got four goals and an assist in the last five and he's got great running games ahead he's taken the opportunity and run of it since coming into the team for mooners now Harland alarmingly quite far down this list which going back to the triple captaincy debate it's an argument that you can make against it three blanks in a row and recently not putting up the the same numbers not the same shot frequency and so on one very tight decision I'm pleased with so far is wood over Calon on the wild card that one really underlines the luck element of FPL I felt there was very little between them and basically it bowled down to Forest looking like a better side so far the season obviously DC had the better overall fixtures and at least he does look slightly better than wood longterm for fixtures but wood obviously in the better team potentially three more game Maks in the team for wood and then I'll shake things up moving on to the bench which is fabianski seeno Gabriel and Greaves so even if there's no concrete news on sacker I could roll regardless with seeno a pretty solid option to Auto sub on if required I've got two free transfers and there's two paths on considering now obviously the first path is just a roll or transfer and look to buy Palmer gami 12 by crewing some free transfers until then option two is to bring Palmer forward and buy him right now before Newcastle home I've only got .4 mil on the bank though so a second free TR will be required to fund it so the second move I'm considering is Gabriel to pinck that obviously that frees up more than enough money and you might think why not someone like vardal that could end up being the best possible route to go but the big tradeoff there is I can't get sacker in around gamei 12 or 13 I'll use plan FPL to show it easier here so this week if I was to buy Palmer and pinck then I could roll in gamei 10 and 11 if all goes well this is how my team would look for those two game leagues and then in gamei 12 I could sell wood for Stewart or only 4 and a half mil forward and then Johnson to sacka and then Trent back to Gabrielle so I'll be temporarily selling Gabriel for Liverpool New Newcastle and Chelsea gabber is 6.3 mil though so I'd lose a bit of Team value in doing this what I don't like is I'd be playing it very tight here as well any other issues in the coming weeks and it' be a minus 4 or i' have to delay the moves till gamei 13 I'd like to do the moves in gamei 12 ideally though cuz wood plays against Arsenal and Johnson plays against Man City then even if there's positive news on sacka it's tempting to make the move regardless as he's not played for weeks now so what's this match Fitness and sharpness going to look like let alone the move does get me an upgrade on P buying pal homes in Newcastle as opposed to sacker against Liverpool if you enjoyed this video make sure you're subscribing it's completely free and obviously drop the video like to show

15,FPLFocal,bRjl7l8--3g,FPL PLAYERS TO BUY | GW9 ✅,2024-10-21T12:02:00Z,welcome back for another video a roller coaster weekend of football for gaming a we've got Monday night's games left to play at the time of recording we're going to discuss the best players to buy moving forward using projection data from FB review let's start with the keepers so at the time of recording there's been 33 clean sheets this season at this stage last season there were 35 and last season there was an unusually large decrease in clean sheets and a significant increase in goals scored perhaps a signed to reduce what we're spending at the back and shift the funds to midfielders and forwards next gameing Edison's top of the keeper projections was City playing home to Southampton Southampton has scored just six times from eight gamings this season so if you're in need of a keeper or a Defender even sit your wor a look ry's bottom of the table this week with 3.5 points however if we look at the next five game we projections R actually still top among all the keepers has the arsal defense gotten worse though it's possible obviously with three red cards it's hard to draw conclusions as the context is important of data Arsenal's 9.2 expected goals considered ranked sixth best currently they were top last season although he's obviously not a Defender erard has been a huge Miss as he still puts in a defensive shift of his pressing his leadership I think arteta has got the Midfield balance a bit wrong especially against Bournemouth even before the red with rice partying Marino playing we might even see naner start the next game the good news is ard's potentially only two or three game weeks away from returning which could have a big effect all around in the team if you're looking for a cheaper keeper then Fen stands out he's home to IP switch this game and after that he's got fil and Bor of Everton and Leicester Len also looks good but obviously an extra not. 5 mil pham's next for Everton brenford Palace and walls the keepers have been pretty unpredictable so far I'm not sure anyone expected anal to be the top scoring keeper after eight game weeks everything considered though if I was won this week I think I'd still pick Ry with a longer term view as a reminder this week There's European football before gameing n so hold those transfers before you lock in Arsenal Villa City Liverpool Chelsey Man United and Spurs all play again before next deadline moving on to the Defenders given the unbelievable fixture for City their Defenders are all over the table this week viio wangji Ruben and Lewis it's sensible to avoid the likes of aangi and Ruben Diaz theyve not started every game and obviously aangi was benched on the weekend Stone started and he did score at least of lisis and vardo there's more upside there's no guarantees they'll start every game either especially in a fure like Southampton home actually where pep might fancy given a a game especially if vardal starts midweek in the Champions League but might not happen AK was back on the bench in game me a vardal still a very good pick this week though and he's probably likely to start than not but obviously it's impossible to predict pep we expected foden to start in kdb's absence and he didn't for example so Dunc is second on the table this week playing home to wolves it is worth noting that after wolves they way to Liverpool and then home to Man City so avoid him if he need a Defender for those weeks as well Brian's fixes are actually amazing from gamei 13 which looks like the perfect time to buy in pennick now got two goals in two games and he makes the table this week with 3.7 points home to IP switch pin Collins are the better alter to dunk if you need a cheap Defender that you can keep playing after this game after it switch it's full and bour of Everton and Leicester venburg for four Ms now started five games in a row as well pin and Collins are completely nailed which is what you get for the extra .5 mil vanderberg could be as well but Frank does have options in fullback so Arsenal home to Liverpool no Arsenal Defenders on the table this week for the first time in a while but they're going to B so be about civo picked up that red card against Bournemouth Aleta says it's going to be left up to the club if they appeal the CBA red card cuz they need to compare it to similar incidents you'd imagine if they do appeal he won't get rescinded so Davis is someone that we talked about last game we he second after Trent for expected goal involvement this season with 1.91 xgi among Defenders the problem is AP switch aren't a solid defense so you're going to be counting on attack and returns more often the not when they concede and further to that now Greaves and to anabia out injured it's okay to start for the next couple but wouldn't look to buy him now on to the midfielders and this week Palmer's top with 6.7 points followed by foden with 6 .6 if he starts and then bumo 6.4 Chelsea are playing Newcastle home which is going to be an interesting watch trepp still sideline of injury Newcastle Vis Stanford Bridge after 1-nil home loss to Brighton oddly enough Newcastle have conceded just eight times this season which actually ranks third best of course they have had isak out for a couple of games which hasn't helped at the other end of the pitch he was back in the team on the weekend anyway Palmer Salah sacka harand son the five premiums they've all hauled multiple times this season but inconsistently it's impossible to own them all three seems to be the sensible maximum without hurting the team balance too much it's also basically impossible to time owning them at the perfect time so sticking with the ones you pick could be the sensible player and just be patient for example going sacka to Palmer after Palmer's 25p pointer obviously meant that you missed those points the week before but then you also missed sacka 16p pointer that all said it's a bit easier to make the case of selling when there's an injury doubt or a notable fixture swing let's see if sacka is involved in the Champions League midweek for Arsenal it was a bit of a surprise to see him not make the squad after what Carls and Aleta both had to say but perhaps Aleta being positive was a sign that we should have paid attention to is anyone taking a chance on foding this week it's one of the best fixures you'll see all season City home to Southampton he's only started once which is concerning this season he's really a risk tolerance pick his predicted minutes will be low if you got the appetite for some risk the upside is massive for him so Bruno was finally back among the points it'll be just an assist last game given what a volatile gamei it was for many a five-pointer was basically whole though we talked about him in last week's videos as he did make the table then as well he's back on it this week with 4.8 points man United's next five features are pretty solid West Ham Chelsea Leicester ipswitch neverton is anyone tempted for 8.2 mil so if we don't get a positive update on sacka who are the best Replacements well Palmer's a logical pick only salah's got more projected points for the next five gamees among midfielders son and boom also excellent choices or as we say foden if you want to take on that risk if you're looking for a cheaper midfielder this week the two players that I like are seeno and and Rogers both playing one another actually so meno took six shots against Arsenal he's a way villain then he's got Man City so it's not the perfect entry point but longterm the fixures are great and he should come good Rogers is home to Bournemouth and then he's way to Spurs and Liverpool before he's got Palace home if you want to really under the radar but excellent pick they look no further than Garo he scored against brenford on the weekend he took Maxima bonus he actually took eight shots that game which was the highest on the weekend of all the fixtures only 6.2 mil and he's played 90 minutes the p four games in a row Bon not has been quietly brilliant lately as well not seen his name mentioned much he's 5 mil and he's got three goals two assists this season including returns in his last three games in a row right now I'd still lean towards Rogers for about the same price the two do have pretty comparable fixtures but vill a far better team bonon not's run if you're interested is Forest ips switch Man United Chelsea and brenford his 1.51 expected go of was actually the highest of all players in the weekend as well 1.34 without expected goals from five shots Tak can three in the Box moving on to the forwards and harland's an absolute Mile in front this week with 8.9 projected points Watkins is next closest to 5.3 Holland started the season almost incomprehensibly well with 10 goals in five games but he's now blanked three games in a row despite the blanks he's got to be the clear favorite for captaincy though such a great fixture I wonder if any's going to be tempted to activate the triple captainship even whether those blanks were enough to deter it a hatrick against newly promoted I switch back in game two and he followed up with another hatrick against West Ham in gamei 3 isach could be a left field shout soon in a couple of gimicks time if he can impress in gamei 9 and 10 he's got Chelsea and then Arsenal before a really solid run of games for now salanki is second after Harland for projected points for the next five somewhat predictably Watkins has continued delivering this season he's got five goals two assists for seven returns and eight we did see ralison back in the team which did see salanki off 18 minutes we also saw Watkins come off for 74 minutes last match for Duran so it's a shame their minutes aren't quite as good this season due to the death so it's a shame their minutes aren't quite as good as we'd hoped especially given how many late goals we seem to be getting this season and I recall last season as well Forest are away to Leicester for gameing n which has got wood on 4.4 points vardy on 4.3 Everton are going to be home to Fulham Calvin Le on 4.3 projected points for that one let us know in the comments what your transfer plans are this week and how you're getting on thanks very much for watching as always see you soon for the next one,1904,1881,welcome back for another video a roller coaster weekend of football for gaming a weve got monday nights games left to play at the time of recording were going to discuss the best players to buy moving forward using projection data from fb review lets start with the keepers so at the time of recording theres been 33 clean sheets this season at this stage last season there were 35 and last season there was an unusually large decrease in clean sheets and a significant increase in goals scored perhaps a signed to reduce what were spending at the back and shift the funds to midfielders and forwards next gameing edisons top of the keeper projections was city playing home to southampton has scored just six times from eight gamings this season so if youre in need of a keeper or a defender even sit your wor a look rys bottom of the table this week with 35 points however if we look at the next five game we projections r still top among all the keepers has the arsal defense gotten worse though its possible with three red cards its hard to draw conclusions as the context is important of data arsenals 92 expected goals considered ranked sixth best currently they were top last season although hes

16,alwayscheating,OoFqFpHoBAU,Red Card Drama &amp; Our GW9 Fantasy Premier League Preview,2024-10-22T21:33:05Z,"[Music] [Applause] hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast we are doing a live recording today I guess this is the first time you and I have actually done a um we've done in person before but in person with like the new setup on YouTube it's all new and different we're also not usually next to each other like this we've done some like London trip side by side you're familiar with the the wedding photographer sort of a thing of like you're going to have to get close together like closer than you're comfortable doing just to make the shot yeah you were saying the Man of Constant Sorrow um old brother brother and speaking of Brothers we're here with producer Dave I am a man there we go don't know the rest of words nice to see right on so we're here to talk about our terrible gameweek eights uh I think I'm the only one of the three of us who had mosala today so I experienced some joyful emotion on Sunday you ended up what 8 10 12 points all told 12 points from Mo yeah so then the the great regret is it's always in in hindsight well obviously I should have been more courageous and I should have Captain mosala instead of Holland so one thing we're going to have to talk about on this episode is yeah Holland has three blanks in a row we're you know for all of the people who didn't believe the theory of no Roger new no de bruyne is really going to eat away at Holland's points potentially and then some some people are saying it was me however it is it is uh uh Saints next week for Man City uh so we we there's no way out for Holland owners once you think you're going to get out this Southampton pulls you back in It's Tricky though because I think um the question now is iide you know a vacuum loading up on Man City players ahead of the Saints match would make a lot of sense but it's weirdly I still don't feel confident they're going to keep clean sheet even against saints like I feel like somehow they're going to have one moment where they just get sloppy and can see a goal and and and I also don't really know what midfielder I would have I mean it may be that you have to wait until the Champions League this week to see if um you know to see if uh like I was saying like if Bernardo Silva doesn't start in the Champions League like he might be someone to Target uh I mean if foden doesn't start in the Champions League I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse about him starting um at the weekend yeah there are a few paths for me to get foden without at without being at the expense of like a premium mid where the whole arsenal Bournemouth match is another thing that we're going to have to unpack but celba owners now basically have a free role on a cheaper Defender uh assuming you don't want to stick with Arsenal defense and I don't think we can make a real case for that right now but that is a great place to make money to upgrade in my case Anthony Gordon to somebody like foden right but we're still waiting for foden to actually do something this season you were just reading about the covid conspiracy someone well I I don't know it's a conspiracy but someone in our app replies said that Co phen recently had covid and then he's still recovering from it that he may potentially have long Co okay okay so I don't know well yeah so we're not we're not doctors Dave Dave are you a doctor uh no but I play one on the podcast um Dr Dave okay yeah well I guess that would actually be a rational explanation we're trying to figure out what's happening with foden you're like there's something going on but it's been happening for years so has he had long Co for years maybe I mean is he patient zero is what we need to figure out last year he was starting matches this early in the season right like his his fbl returns last season are actually pretty solid I think it was they have double digit goals and assists last year somewhere somewhere in that range at least I mean PFA player of the year uh it's hard to deny no we're not here to talk about foden's Talent level we're here to talk about the mystery of what's going on at Manchester City and like that performance against wolves felt in some ways similar to the uh performance against Arsenal where they really had to hammer away at a good defensive performance from wolves until they finally got the Breakthrough at the very end also it felt a little bit like City playing Fen last uh two weeks ago yeah uh where the the chances that wolves got were on the counter and were pretty good chances and uh one of them they finished and the other they they simply didn't so it could be looking a lot worse for City right now on the table but Liverpool now one point ahead can we start talking about Liverpool as like title cont I mean not not like it's far-fetched to imagine that this stacked team would be title contenders but Arsenal are are just like quickly fading away from this discussion now we're back to the Glory Days of City versus Liverpool yeah and I think this was the match the Arsenal Bournemouth match and you know I guess we let's do actually you know what let's do a little reset here I'm kind of freestyling here I enjoy your freestyling but we put together this nice running order and I think that we should uh try to stick to it so let's let's kick things off so game week eight kicks off with uh the Spurs uh Spurs West Ham match on uh Saturday morning you and I go to Smithfield Hall yeah meet up with a listener that was nice yeah shout out to fpl Rock uh on Twitter Darren wonderful guy really enjoyed chatting with him he's been and seen football played all over planet Earth so it's just interesting sort of hearing uh what what he's seen and and also his FPL thoughts he run some FPL content uh out of a podcast in Cuba yeah got some Spanish uh content so that that was that was very cool so shout out to Darren thanks for coming out and the scene is always good at Smithfield Hall it's a West Ham supporters bar as well as a Manchester United bar so we walked into great sorrow and then uh we emerged Victorious with a very um Manchester United fans just can't understand how they got away with it I suppose right yeah yeah I mean I think that it was kind of uh right so you know the the the match on Saturday morning though was was was pretty interesting right I think uh you had a little bit of Saka drama which we can talk about more in a second but uh one option was to move Saka to Sun uh which that was kind of the only move that really would have worked out this week I guess I guess you did get a foden assist late right but like that's not you know four points not that significant um but I think uh what was kind of the bigger news was that you had um poro blank Brennan Johnson blank and um blank in a four in a four goal Spurs match which I I feel like sort of that like it just the whole Vibe this week was a real post International break like a little some shaky I thought the matches today for example were really like surprisingly low quality um I thought uh I mean the Spurs uh or not the spur the Chelsea um Liverpool match I thought was um really foul heavy and um and the the Man City Wolves was just odd like I just felt like it was it was such a especially the second half it it was just a like a real slog and we've seen a lot of that with Man City recently yeah you're looking for much more dynamism from Man City they seem to just insist that they can pass through any low block but ultimately I think they just need more players be it greish doku saevinho who can just beat a man and they're that just to create something in the box which makes it even more confusing as to why foden's roll out has been so slow because he is really good at operating in those tight spaces and he could certainly help Holland had precious few touches one or two moments that could have easily been goalscoring opportunities but you're left feeling like not awesome about Holland and this city team despite that victory yeah so um let's get into I mean I I think like just to go through the weekend which I think might be kind of a cleaner cleaner you want we really want to talk you know what do we just really want to talk about Sunday and should we just keep it uh you want you want to work backwards here Brandon because we just we just saw these matches so maybe maybe working back maybe we just we scrapped the running order already this lovely running order that we put together this morning uh what are your FPL takeaways from Liverpool Chelsea yeah I think my takeaways are that Chelsea are not a defensive team you know there was that moment where I think that Sanchez's value was very much inflated by the pens save the 15p pointer that he got Y and then they ran into some yellow card suspensions and there was a lot of like like in-game rotation with the backline from moresa against Chelsea so you were saying you feel like moresa rotates too much too much like what what that I feel like mesa's Hit Upon something with Chelsea that is certainly working in the attack uh in the attack aspect but now he just needs to find some cohesion and some continuity and he's not doing that at all and I I guess he's just kind of working with the situation that he got where he had two big of Squad and he's really just trying to challenge these players to show him where that continuity was would be but um I still think it's Palmer or nobody from the attack Nicholas Jackson did have a pretty good goal though so I guess I guess if you have ridden out a a small drought with Nico Jackson uh suddenly you should be booed by what happened he's the CL he is the like one of those players that can be hard to evaluate in fantasy because he has like truly Terri body language like when you watch him play he looks like he's absolutely miserable out there I mean he's sort of in that like who who we put in there it's like uh uh mesit Ozil sort of famously was a bad body language player but who else was like I feel like they were missing some other of course oh Brandon always with the yeah what do you think Dave might for getting a bad bad body language player here how do you rate your body language Dave um right I mean the great thing about New York is there's so much to see and do I'm think thinking about that they might be Giant song but um my body language right now it's it's hurting but uh it was good early in the week and then just as the games have gone on like you like you said these Sunday games it's really just dragging us down it it has nothing to do with you going to Raves and for yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah rolling in yeah exactly but but I I guess like to finish that point on on Chelsea the Wingers as as good as they are individually they're still trying to find like it's does feel like moresa wants Netto to work and uh and Sancho did not have a great game mow is really just feast or famine with him fantasy wise uh so kind of like as much potential as there is with Chelsea yeah uh then you get to Liverpool your feelings on Liverpool so you only have Trent how are you feeling about Trent is that a good use of money for you at the moment he's honestly been fine I mean when I think about how my season's gone so far Trent's performance is is not at the top of the list by by any means I mean getting three consecutive blanks from Holland has honestly been a bigger problem for me considering I mean this week was a little bit different this week he was heavily Captain the last two weeks though he was a little bit of a differential Captain it didn't come through at all and so um you know my I have like just sort of larger problems with with man city that I'm trying to sort of figure out um I I suppose I've dodged at Bola by not having Rico Lewis like that's one of the like you know that's one of the few uh I guess that's worked out uh reasonably well but um I mean I I thought Salah had a real um like a modern Salah performance right where he sort of um like you know like he struggles to take people on still but now he's now he's heads up looking for the PA which has really unlocked another aspect of his game and you saw him trying a lot from wi to find his teammates in this match as you have through a lot of this season so as I am I I've been like over the last few weeks looking for the jumping off point to move Salah to either Saka or Palmer and after this weekend um yeah I think I'm gonna gota keep going with Salah uh oh yeah though I me they play Arsenal away in in gameweek nine so uh but but I mean what would your I guess I mean Palmer let's see Palmer plays Newcastle next week and Newcastle are a total mess right now uh and Anthony Gordon has just been kind of he's he's turned from uh differential into just kind of like weirdly killing my my game weeks from his Miss pens to the the blanket home against Brighton so uh obviously that is a huge opportunity I think for Palmer against Newcastle in gameweek nine yeah yeah I think so I mean is that worth a transfer I guess that would be the question like is it worth so you have two transfers right going into game week n as do I Dave do you have did you make a transfer this week or you no I have five I think do you really I think I wow that's amazing so you actually got to five I've been waiting for someone to get to five transfers I think hold on let me double let me live check here right no I got four I guess sorry okay is that right one more week to go Dave yeah I think I I could roll I could roll wow I mean because you're doing you're like what like a 3K right now in the world something like that yeah I who's counting you know no I think I saw that you and Dave are roughly exactly in the same position oh good yeah so he's doing uh equally terrible that's great I mean the seven figures yeah yeah me too sadly on 30 points right now thank you Mo I did terribly on Saturday the only thing I got was a goal from Morgan Rogers it was blanks from hovers uh the minus three from celba and just just bad news all around Fulham uh didn't just didn't uh coales even though well okay I'm already moving to Saturday but just for my team yeah you are uh yeah you got like a you're all over the place right now talk about FH I think it's cuz the camera is on you and you're you're feeling like a lot of pressure pressure it's like Albert Brooks and Broadcast News but in your 30 points with just Dean Henderson to go like 6.5 million gameweek rank moving me to around 1.6 million overall so I'll certainly be finishing on a red error for the week and I'm just waiting for the moment to kick on man I think a lot of people are feeling that way I mean I'm on 26 I have e and uh Henderson to go and so I'm I'm kind of feeling the same I was actually feeling okay uh going into this match and I you know if I'd gotten anything from Palmer or Trent um I would feel uh okay about this week but I mean I'm already looking at the I think the average score is 31 so I mean I'm already five under average and so it's kind of you know it's and and E hasn't done anything really the entire season right one one attacking return in in eight weeks so or I guess seven weeks we'll see what he does tomorrow so yeah but I think you know it's one of those weeks where it's it's it's like a good week to have a bad week you know as as they say there's you know it's not like there's a a massive swing or anything like that so Dave what about you like how are you looking on your points so far this weekend uh 20 something like everyone else 24 25 Watkins and Rogers we'll talk about ful them I guess but like we said tomorrow's game is gonna be the clinch the f hammerwood I got go e it's it's G to be a it's G to be an interest moving a move week yeah that's true and I have Henderson so maybe Henderson I'll have you know a fantastic match oh I guess I am actually on 27 because I get I get one point Off the Bench I get um Robinson in for Greaves I thought Robinson had a yellow but apparently he didn't he put they put a yellow up on the screen at least on the uh us version of the broadcast and it was an errant graphic apparently he comes through with a clean clean one should we take a quick moment we because we're recording early on Saturday we've got some more UK listeners in the YouTube chat our friend uh FPL yellow Army also uh Sebastian front also has five free transfers so you know that's a we're on the lookout for these rare people these unicorns the are there any questions in the chat we had a we had a an addition to the bad body language of Bruno oh Bruno yeah he's a great he's a great bad body language player for that was an interesting moment in that Manchester United match where there was an a camera angle on Bruno where I thought thought he had joined the uh Turkish hair transplant Brigade his hair just looked really full this weekend for for some reason so but but I kind of backed away from that theory and I just feel like I need to say Bruno your hair looked really you had a great hair day on Saturday that's remember when Sal used to have the really long hair and it was just like not a great I bet it looked cool off the pitch but it was like it really didn't uh did not work on if if it rained it was not a great look that hair had bus in it though that hair did have goals in it that's that's a fair point yeah that's a fair point uh all right well let's so let's return back to Saturday as as you were saying it's I think uh The fulam Villa match it's I think might take away I mean you know Morgan Rogers scored a goal Watkins scored a goal I mean I don't think there's anything super dramatic in that I guess my my big fantasy take away from that match would have been that R Jimenez got the full 90 minutes uh took took you know scored a goal early a nice goal as well and uh played uh I thought pretty well through through outout I mean he really only had the one the one big chance but I think if there's been a little bit of hesitation around him just because of his injury history and stuff like that I you know this really feels like the season where we're all kind of struggling to find that cheap third forward and maybe um maybe that doesn't really exist maybe it's Chris Wood honestly I mean you know he's he's the only consistent one I actually I want to ask Brandon about what he feels about himen is because I saw after the match he's the Top Value forward on Mel tf's table Holland a Buy Brandon why not I mean f ful are an attacking team if nothing else right now and mun's just he he's lost his spot to Raul Raul had a fantastic International break with Mexico scoring a screamer and and F do have good fixtures right terrific run yeah Everton brenford Palace wolves in the next four I mean that's a really really strong run I although one other takeaway from Saturday is uh two clean sheets in a row for every um they have red the ship and we kind of I don't know about you guys I I just assumed this would happen eventually it was it was I mean like they last season they had yeah they had a ton of injuries to start the season right and so we kind of um and and even now they I mean brth weight is still not back although he should be soon um and that that's actually one of the unfortunate things is that probably uh Michael Keane who um had a great match today or Le from Nel perspective um he's at 4.1 million but I think you have to avoid ke unfortunately because I do think that he had been basically dropped for br branway last year and so I think he's a dub but um you did have um the um Michael Kane though remains a great actor Michael Kane fantastic um see when he scores points his his voice the trip that was good we needed that Dave yeah but I but I mean speaking of Everton uh you know I think that for anyone who's looking like you and I like one of the things that really screwed us is one reasons that you and I and and many others are on less than 30 is he has a CBA right and not just getting negative3 from him but the fact that anyone who had Rya got got hurt by that um sort of eliminated all of Arsenal's attacking you know sort of potential in that match sure yeah it it hurt me having hovers the damage was already done to Saka owners so Saka being a Miss there was just it was an interesting sort of wave waveform of content leading up to the game we talking about Saka I mean Andy Martin I think probably had the cleverest thing where he actually drove down to Arsenal's hotel in Bournemouth and took a photo of himself and where they had saw the team getting off the bus to do a height comparison to see he's based he's based in South Africa too so that's that's incredible commitment yeah so I hope you have Diamond status Andy to afford that flight because to do that last minute is is is crazy there's a lot of sort of uh Sturm and Drang about uh who knew what uh do we know anything Josh about team sheets what what do you mean do you getting inside leaks yeah oh yeah right so okay yeah I okay I wouldn't know the first thing of how to get them to be hon so you and yeah so you and I thought about this and so just for anyone who isn't um on Twitter and and congratulations if you aren't I mean that's that's fantastic good on yeah exactly and Twitter Twitter is a is a dying social media network uh that that has now been um like it's primarily FPL as far as I can tell it's like those are the people who are like hanging on and they're just everyone is absolutely furious with each other and this is like uh this been going on for like a year and a half I actually basically bowed out like unfortun I've now turned Twitter into like a place where I just like share like podcast information FPL Twitter is like going to a Sunday family dinner uh with your like extended relatives right often it is cordial but you all know that you all secretly hate each other or it's yeah it's like a it's like a family trip that go that's one day too long you know and yeah and I just think U okay the C I have a couple of thoughts about this and so basically the the issue was that there was a lot of you know information about Saka or a lack of information about Saka really um and most of the uh people who are making FPL I don't actually like the phrase content creators I don't know why but like a lot of people who make FPL YouTube videos and podcast whever were're advocating to keep Saka and that's where we I mean you know I I just my my rationale was basically that he always starts he always starts artetta is not one of these managers like if artetta says that he's close to starting my expectation is that he probably will start it's not like I don't think it's you know like whereas other other managers likeed Eddie how for example right you genuinely have no idea like if how says that ESO is we plan to have him start tomorrow that means it's like 5050 right like you you genuinely can't believe um what he says but I I think um and so there was a lot of debate about this and then it turned out like basically all of these people dropped um Saka um and you and I uh cool guys that we are didn't even have Saka so we were able to avoid we had no one to drop yeah we had no one to drop so uh and Dave you had you had Saka yourself right and so you you kept him yeah I mean you're also in the club I was in was in the you know we all family in the club yeah yeah uh no that was my thought too it's like worst case scenario he's not in Squad get Sing Off the Bench at Sano for sub so it's actually that was a pretty easy solution but like we were talking about before I think it was a sound Theory because the pictures coming up are turning for Saka they you know with no odog guard he's looking all off so but I they also the AL Alternatives weren't super clean like it's a double transfer to Palmer or it's foden who we all we already talked about is a risk and I love foden but so was a risk too a little bit and inconsistent as well I mean he's got a really sun has not been a like a super reliable fantasy this season sun was was clearly past fit for the weekend but I agree with you both like it was Spurs were in at least some goal scoring form without him you never know how slowly angrew is going to want to bring him back there yeah so there was some risk there too but that turned out to be the the best move I think in some ways that we're sort of a little bit on the outside of this of this world because a lot of the content that we do we're not we're not doing a lot of deadline streams right we're not like talking to 10 minutes before partially because we don't uh we're we're still asleep when the deadline hits right it's like you know the the deadline is 6 AM East Coast time it is not I am not up at in most cases every now and then if it's like if it's crucial you know I'll I'll do it but in general I'm not waking up at 5:15 to to check things I'm just I'm kind of going with it and so I think you know so we don't necessarily get like hit by this stuff as much but I think this there's an idea out there that and I guess like this this just sort of speaks I think a little bit and I I you know like forgive me if I'm going off off FPL here a little bit but like just the relationship that people have with people who create content a little bit and this idea that that like hey you were saying to me yesterday hey like no one's making like a ton of money on this there's this belief that that there's this Ivory Tower in which somebody who makes just go to I I implore you to go to our YouTube channel and look at the quality of of this uh we're what I Shing the camera Yeah we actually okay yeah well okay yeah back back back up I there you're talking about us here yeah by the way I'm in Josh's house right now and uh I don't know the money seems to be rolling in here so yeah you are in a parlor so yeah but but none none nonetheless the the point is that there there is this this sort of like class structure and content creators um are a yeah like reaping this incredible Revenue from it while while not doing any work like the people who do make money from it like work their tails off and we so whatever that that would be the point can I ask you a question though about that so even putting the money aside or including the money even what's the incentive to lie right yeah does that mean you're going to watch more contribute to someone who lies to you what's the what's the game theory of this I'm not understanding there's some Edge in duding three or 400 people or whatever right about about what you're doing it's like there's there's 12 million people or whatever 11 million people playing fantasy like the the amount of people that you would gain an edge on is so small right and well yeah you're not making money by playing FPL because that would be against the rules right yeah well there's that too yeah so I don't understand like what even is the argument of why but I think that's the sub I think that's the subex the subtext of people getting mad about this stuff is that um that they are doing it to get an edge over over the opposition right I think that that that to me is what people are mad about this idea that there's like they have secret knowledge they're not sharing in order to like I suppose get more Rank and I think you're rightly making the case and again we don't need to like belabor this because even so like Andy said he might um change it two days before I watched a video so I I don't see where people get this yeah and just this idea that like that people have I actually don't think there's that much I mean I'm in plenty of like DM threads with like these exact people and a lot of them like I believe me like a lot of them are talking minutes before the deadline trying to like casting about asking everybody else if they know anything right it's not like it's not like there's like this secret feed and we know the cheaters are pro leaks you guys will share any leaks no one's ever done it though you know it's a you know the problem is our our listen Base Pro right there proof we're breaking conspiracies here live I think it's it's ultimately to our benefit that our listener base is not really a Twitter base and so it's so funny like I think of my friends no and Louise who are producers of the Pod and every now and then I'll talk to them and they they're just they do not pay attention to any of this kind of stuff and they think like it's insane that anybody does you know and I'm like that's probably like the approach even though they manage a fantasy team the joy they derive is uh is is watching the matches on the weekend and exactly and they have a mini League of Their Own and I we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and that a lot of the anger that people have about fantasy stems from really caring about overall rank yeah right and I think that this is just something I think like maybe this like has to be like a theme for us this year which is like invest in your mini leagues and invest in head-to-head leagues invest in stuff that you can do with smaller groups of people where you have a better chance of winning because if your goal is to finish in the top 10,000 out of 11 million people your odds are about as good as as you know as like it's not like winning the lottery but it's about like you know about as good as Arsenal winning the the league you say yeah exactly you're talking about investing time I'd say they're lower than that you know yeah talking about time investment right yeah time in yeah all of it you know yeah so it's just like it's it's just not really um I I just think like I think our goals should be focused on um and like find like find like again like yes watch the matches andjoy them find moments of joy in that of course um but I think just like looking purely from a fantasy point of view if you're if you're only thinking about overall rank it's probably a quick way to um just spend a lot of week and I I feel guilty of this too spend a lot of time getting really frustrated right like if I asked you like right now I am feeling frustrated my season right I'm like in the millions like like Davis and I mean you're not that far into the hundreds thousands 1.6 million are you yeah exactly so like we're all you know like a a rough season and and but if I look at like and I actually have to force myself to do this right but if I looked at our mini leagues even like the ones that are like more competitive or I really would like to win I maybe 30 points back 35 like it's nothing right there's you know 30 weeks to go in the season like it's so long plus the mystery chip that's G to change everything exactly maybe the mystery chip will just be like you click the button and you get the leaks yeah you get the leaks or it's like or it's like a lottery and it's like you just hit a button you get like someone gets an extra 100 points someone gets an extra you know 200 like who knows what's going to happen that the mystery chip yes well uh so that's that's really what's going on that's an update on what's going on in the FPL Twitter yeah space speaking of conspiracies though do we need to go back to Arsenal and talk about further red card drama for them I what what did you make of the civa red card and like Declan rice saying to the offical after the match it happens to us every week well I mean that's just like that's a self every manager is full of self-pity and and and you know and as are a lot of um like you mean like listen like it's it to me it's actually and everyone's everyone who is like provar is gonna hate this but to me it's like it's another V problem which is basically that it it Force like there's no once you look at V there's no way not to call that a red card right because it is by every technical rule like like off like it's it's he's the last man yeah he's the last Defender and so you have to do it but the referee on the pitch called it a yellow and that from a from like an enjoyment standpoint and ultimately kind of from a fantasy standpoint too um depending on how many Arsenal assets you had I guess it it's like it's the it's it like it made it made for a worse match right and so it's like that that is what's frustrating to me and I just think that V I mean I don't know I guess EXA same play happened today against with Liverpool Chelsea where tosen took Joe to down with first 10 minutes of the they didn't car C and Michael Oliver in the varo decided to stick with the yellow card Ino which I think was smart it was like four I don't think he would arve you day it was like four seconds in he was like nope this we're just not gonna call this right so you know you you do feel for Arsenal getting hit with all these sort of like minor infractions that lead to red cards but iy it is fluky and I have this theory that I think artetta you know and anyone who's watched the All or Nothing Amazon documentary about uh Etta's season with that season with Arsenal where artetta is just kind of a guy who really enjoys putting out these like big brain you know NBA theories about how to play football and how to be tactical and I think his weirdness is now in the heads of all of these Arsenal players so they're like overthinking all of these instances on the pitch and trying to gain an edge like artetta tries to gain an edge in the press conference room of like lying about players in status and then he's got his players on the pitch kind of doing weird similar types of things but with trying to like walk that red card line or delaying the game and all that stff I think it's I just think it's really fluky honestly and I think um I mean if you look at all the all the situations um it's you had a time wasting right that's that's isn't that basically what um got um trer knocked out of the match in the man city right it's like time wasting and um you had uh the dean rice I actually don't think should have been a red card I mean it was obviously a second yellow and a red but like I thought that one was like another was that was that time wasting too so same exact same thing that trer did yeah so um yeah so two time wastings and then and then a kind of technically accurate red card so I I think that is all just like fluky stuff that'll that that will will get kind of wiped away but I am sort of curious about the the clean sheet part of it and the sort of and I think there is like a like an actual FPL angle to this and and whether we think I mean my feeling is basically this and you guys tell me if you disagree um you had a lot of um a lot of international tournaments this summer right and so a lot of players came back late um a lot of top players especially Defenders you know Center like a bunch of center backs uh top clubs were playing not Ben White as we all know but many others uh of course now he's a right back mostly um but I think that you um so they didn't necessarily have enough time to practice together and I think that uh I think there so a little bit of that a little bit of there's so much money in the Premier League now that even bouth level clubs can get like a vanon type players right like you just like you can like basically bring in like really talented Brazilians to be your forward even if you're like the 15th best team in the Premier League imagine shakiri at Stoke City it's it's that sort of and so I think that that's part of it too it's just like it's I don't think you get like in um La Liga you know or or the Bundesliga like this level of of talent like at the in the bottom you know third of the of the league and so I think that that affects clean sheets maybe like more increasingly but I but I do think um ultimately long term that we will get there again and and maybe this is just something that we just really need to like think about going forward which is just don't Focus don't invest too much money in your defense the first half of the season and the second half of the season is when you can start to kind of turn the dial a little bit because I feel like we see this every single year with man city which is that they have this kind of run where they caned a bunch of goals and then the final 10 weeks of the Season no one can score on them right it is like they one nil their way to a title and I just don't I just think we're going to see that again this year um yeah what do you guys think yeah Dave Man City I mean that they're they're a punchline defensively at least in fantasy terms how how how close are you as of today in considering a city Defender for the run you brought this up and I just immedately said like you you know like I just I've gone through the ederson ringer we've all had like like Josh you said Rico I mean he is he's probably a buy still because he's starting every match right I guess so I mean he and he does get forward a little bit too will be the bandwagon during this transfer window because the Run continues for city is he scored his second goal of the season and he finished last season so strong that people will remember that yeah so I think CBA to guardi is probably the algorithmic preference for going into gameweek nine that's interesting that that actually makes a lot of sense I'm surprised I haven't really thought about that more seriously that that's a pretty logical move I know but like you just said in that long um point you made I think was good though I like why would we have that undermine the point I just made yeah it actually makes a lot of sense I mean uh yeah can I spend more money on my defense ignore everything I just said yeah and plus Trent like if we have him and Gabriel or sure yeah that's why R loose might feel more tempting because you can use that money so what do yeah how do you measure the upside of guiol really is just the same with Trent where you're just kind of talking about the high ceilings but it has been so variable the Returns on Defenders that I you know I'm sure a an equally compelling case could be made to just getting all 4.5 well let well there's not that many good can you bring up the FPL Hub heat map for guardal yeah yeah exactly I let me see if I can pull that up in real time splits pleas yeah without things it's getting too chaotic here but I am I am okay so let's let's say that like we we like we actually believe what I've just said which is that you want to U maybe scale back a little bit on your defense and I I feel this way a little bit about Trent where I do wonder if that money could be spent um invested in a in you know like a better third forward perhaps I have Jamie vary at the moment like that can't last I'm Gonna Keep I'm Gonna Keep vard Ponzi scheme is not I know yeah exactly I did finally get a goal this week thankfully V pump and dump over here yeah exactly that go yeah exactly if we all get B it's better for Josh this If This Were draft leue then I'd be be even better I'd be trying to you switch him off but um yeah so he's got to go eventually and maybe there's like a you know I don't know like maybe I I can find someone else it could just be I go back to Chris Wood but let's say that I want to um start taking some money on my defense and put it in my Midfield and and forward lines um and I think you know and maybe the other the other way would be that we've talked before about how you just want to try to have three out of four of these like expensive premium assets and that just may be the thing that you need to do and that you're going to always get something and I think we saw that this week right like um obviously Saka didn't play but and I guess when I say four I'm thinking Saka Holland uh Palmer and Salah right those are like the big kind of four the big four fantasy assets this season I think and uh it seems like every single week you're gonna get like one of those will carry you if you have them um now obviously you could have had Holland um Holland Saka and um Palmer and Palmer this week and that would have been three blanks but I think without Saka playing I think if Saka had played that's a totally different story I'm going to ask you hypothetical here Josh and Dave I want to hear your opinion too imagine Holland blanks against Southampton at home at the Edy hod you laugh and you think like how improbable it is right but it'll be four blanks in a row and in those blanks you have some weak opposition you look at the injuries surrounding the club how close would you be to dropping Holland uh at if he were to blank against Southampton I mean is that a conversation to even entertain it wouldn't be at the top of my priority list still I want to make a decision off one week but also we had a question on the YouTube of are you uh is this hurting the Holland triple Captain shout against South I I think it talking about dumping him people are talking about triple Captain him like very much hurts it I don't know I don't know how you can triple Captain him at the moment I mean yeah like I think he'll score this this next weekend but if there was a uh say like foden uh I'm sorry well say foden and de bruyne returns from his injury midweek in the Champions League and there was that dramatic a shift in how you expected Man City to line up against Southampton then potentially but yes as it is given the state of play I I just cannot of fathom triple captaining Holland right now what do you think Dave I don't know maybe dibling in you know if they could do yeah yeah give it to dibling for the end of the season I'm thinking the other side the Galaxy brand they keep leing goals you know Val that's true dibling he 4.5 right yeah I'm just I'm a you know like you Josh I enjoy by the way on the on the patreon Pod you go through some of the odds of the anytime goal scores I think right I'm I'll be honest I'm a slave to those odds because like you know those are efficient markets usually and just Holland's just always very good odds to do something so I I don't see myself dropping them hly it is like they have to it feels like P figure this it's a little bit like um uh like we were talking about D and Everton uh earlier it's like this idea that things aren't working and they're not feeding the ball to Holland is like a problem that can't be fixed is is I think wrong right like in gandan and ver Silva and Phil foden whenever he gets over his long covid you know in the years to come I don't know I don't know who know I'm not I'm not actually planting that in the world that was just what somebody said in one of our replies but you know I think that you have um like eventually they're going to figure maybe Jack relish needs to get back in there like they need like somebody who's like a better Creator right I'm not sure doku is as good of a Creator as Gish on the on the left and so I think that you know they're and obviously they're missing rodry but I I just I I I do think that pep is this is the Premier League's best manager and I think that he'll eventually and I mean eventually like as in like 20 weeks I think like by by by this weekend possibly he's going to uh figure it [Music] out um but to go back to my question about um defense let's say we we wanted to take the money out looking at these fixtures like the next seven this actually I I almost never look seven fixtures ahead by the way I think um five or six is as far as I ever want to look um this because too many things change to people get injured but um are there a couple of teams that you would recommend somebody targeted if they were looking to drop CBA or if they were looking to um clear out money to bring in let's say Saka gets a clean bill of health and I mean it's actually a terrible we to bring in Saka but you know let's say let's say you want to bring in Palmer you know and you want to keep Saka while you're doing it who would be some cheap Defenders that you might look at I like still like Nottingham Forest uh great stats I am haunted by that assist that Ana had against Liverpool to Hudson ooy uh earlier this season I think and they have at least two good fixtures coming up with you're haunted like cuzz you wanted to I'm haunted just in like I think about it all the time I'm not like it really affected my life it's like it's like a 19th century like English novel spooky season uh I am doing a lot of opium though to go with the Victorian theme so maybe that has something to do with what how I see Ana everywhere but uh I I do but they have Lester away and then West Ham at home and West Ham just the the implosion continues and even Newcastle at home You' have to like for Forest so I think you mentioned Everton before and Everton have this sort of Newfound defensive form I'm curious about these fixtures though for Everton Fulham even though they're hosting Fulham are an attacking team very capable of scoring we talked about the run that Raul is on and then probably the two best defensive fixures for Everton are away from home with Southampton and West Ham and then they finish off this mini run of theirs with brenford uh at hosting at goodison Pork Park who is also pretty Adept Fork I wonder if that's a little stand that they have outside the stadium how could it not be how could the best uh the best sausage is this side of the you know the TS or something like this um which I know is does not run as far north as that but uh so if I'm comparing Everton and Forest that's my little like te AET there yeah I'm I'm going Forest yeah I was making a tiny shout for um oogi um as a kind of Cheaper route into the Spurs defense um but you know the problem right now is uh you're not getting clean sheets anywhere right and so you ideally this is one of the reasons I'm not like dying to get rid of Trent because I'm like well at least he has different like multiple routes to points right like sometimes I'll fluke into a clean sheet and sometimes I'll I'll get an attack and return uh but ad doy has actually been like a reasonably attacking asset for um for Spurs and so he might be somebody I mean obviously poro is still the kind of top por has set pieces over Udi he's more consistent defensively he does shoot more he had a really great opportunity offer a corner kick this on on Saturday and some would argue that van Dean is is roughly the same price as Udi and maybe he's a little bit more con consistent I don't know Udi's had a very strange season he's had moments where he's been very defensively inept but that's just like a read outside of the fantasy game it's just all about returns and I do see what you're seeing Josh where he is actually getting into the box a bit more when they're pushing down that left hand side of the pitch I guess it's just that he's 4.9 million right so he's he's pretty cheap like you could you could move um and they have had like a you know a pretty decent run of fixtures um uh Palace Villa uh I mean Villa's a tough fixture obviously but then if switch and full Li at home two of the three after that so um you know I don't what do you think Dave about the Spurs defense in general I mean obviously it's been a source of some frustration the last few weeks yeah I I think porro is the obvious move if you're going to do a CA replacement yeah so but it's not I'm not you know super excited and yeah I'd have to consult the heat maps on new doggy yeah I don't have a heat map here but I mean por por over here por por you know 5.5 million is poro so he's point6 more than um than ad dogy but he does have you know it's five blanks and six for poro as well which is kind of a lot for like a to me it's like if I'm if I'm going to get a Defender that costs more than 5 million I really want so I I really I want to be a some kind of return whether it's a clean attack return like basically every other match right because it's quite a lot of money when you can sort of fluke your way into clean sheets with any old 4.5 million well that's what I'm saying is it even worth it at that point because then just go for the clean sheets with like you know forest or Brighton or anyone dice true yeah and AD doy's just got the one assist so far in the season you're not g to get a return from a Defender every other game it seems like at the moment yeah exactly maybe maybe Trent gets you the closest yellow makes a good point on the chat it was Anthony Elena uh who actually got that assist not well so I'm still haunted by Ana uh I'm trying to figure out why it's a spectre you can't you can't make out the shapes you know it's it's like a smoke uh Smokey you know Vision it could be Grandma it could be Grandma I'm not sure Grandma that's I think that's the title for today's podcast actually it could be grandma and other thoughts on game week n um all right well let's um anything else that you want to discuss we can we can move on actually and talk about game week n in a second here but any other kind of final thoughts on um on the matches that we saw over the weekend I think we probably covered everything I guess the one you know Newcastle um that is the one where I just it's surprising to me they've had a number of good fixtures and it just feels like um the The Vibes are off magic yeah we need a Vibe shift uh with with Newcastle sometime soon it it is all it all stems we thought that all of uh newcastle's good fortune and good form stemm from jool Linton at turned out it was Kieran trippier the whole time yeah and as he has faded from the team so has has has the form so all right I think it's over for let's let's move on well let's talk about game week n just quickly before we do I wanted to give a quick shout

an extra podcast each week uh we also do uh we're on the we're on the Discord the Discord is is um I'm honestly and I know I always say this and it's it but it like the way it kind of continues to evolve and expand it's really there are people in there who who it's it's a it's it really it feels like it's genuinely repl social media for a lot of people and I think in a way that's really positive um and there's lots of little sub I think because you and I are mods on there we like we see every little subgroup right and there's little there's little we see everything you know but there's these little you know South American I see what you and the Norwegian channel are up to okay don't think that we're not watching reading meets and and there's like there's there's a betting Channel and there's fashion and like music and NFL I'm the mod of NFL so yeah you're the mod of NFL exactly there's NFL fantasy leag there's all kinds of stuff on there and so it's a fun commun so if you're feel like if this Saka situation and you're just like oh my God I'm just so sick of this stuff and you want to be somewhere where like things are just a little calmer and people aren't screaming each other all the time uh you can go to patreon.com support the podcast and even at the lowest pledge level you get access to the Discord and so that's just a nice way to maybe um uh you know get some access to some new fantasy um content and then um we're also we're going to start a contest sometime soon I think we talking about maybe doing it before the second half this time around just because I know some people are getting a little frustrated with their overall ranks and it might be a chance to uh get to juice things up maybe we'll do it like after the next um juice juice yeah we have thankfully I know you guys are sick of the Premier League already we got another National break coming up in a couple of weeks and so it might be a time to um to to kick off one one weekend of Premier League was plenty get me out of here I know exactly we're already gearing up for the next IB so uh we should do like an off to thee side FPL Challenge League or something it's like you guys like I I don't even know what FPL challenge is and you were explaining to me I was like actually sounds kind of fun and if it's a daily fantasy there's always you don't have to worry about your current team so maybe we can do like a second half like Discord League or something with that it's a little it's a little bit like D and D where it's like you need someone to be like the like I mean like you need someone to like actually be the kind of like um what are they a dungeon master dungeon master yeah you just need someone to be um that was the word I thought it was then I was like I doubted myself at the last second but you basically need somebody to safe politically to say d Master yeah exactly I'm not going to get canceled for saying dungeon master uh no but it's um it's a you know it's like you need someone to who's like enthusiastic who kind of leads the charge right and actually this goes back to the mini league thing we were talking about before too this is kind of like patreon stuff aside but um if you you know if you're not if the person who leads your mini league isn't like actively managing it or like engaging it maybe you need to be that person you know it's like uh it's like be the you know be the change exactly thank you Obama thank thanks Obama you know all right well let's move on then um I want to look ahead to to gameweek nine um I think the captaincy we have a couple of questions too but just just to kind of kick things off um captaincy I think is is relatively straightforward this week right I I I think uh it's gonna be I very hard for me to Envision not going with ear and Holland even with those blanks but if Holland were to get injured or if there was some risk of him starting right there's some leak that comes out that he's not um expected to start this match or that um then I think um you could you could consider UMO uh right I think 100% hosting switch could be one yeah and bomo blank this week for the first time in quite a while and just imagine having an asset where it's surprising when they blank and his name is not erling Holland right uh it was it was surprising kind of to see I'm bomo blank this week and he has a plum home fixture uh apologies to our buddy James Holland but ipswitch just have not got going this season at all and for all the talk about how well-managed they are and and how they they're they're sort of like canny enough to play in the Premier League they are a team to Target at this point yeah as far as I'm concerned as far as everyone's concerned yeah I'm going out on a limb here I understand but um okay so like that's so Captain C fairly simple Vice Captain I think actually probably will end up putting on and maybe I'll put on Cole Palmer I mean that would be the other um kind of logical VC pick against Everton well that's an interesting question actually because I do think that Everton is a team where you could Target their defensive assets too and I I wonder if that could be um I mean to me I guess like maybe the most likely scenario was like 1-1 for that match but I I one nil Everton win wouldn't be like a shocking result there um so what about um in terms of your guys um your teams this week maybe we'll start with Dave what are you um you have five you have four transfers yeah I'm rolling no matter what to get the five just for the bit for the banter just to see that number in the in the bus team next week are you are you actually are you being serious like think I mean I mean I have a celba problem I guess I have a Saka half problem yeah so those we we'd share your team but just because we've got this kind of like hacked setup for the today's stream I'm not gonna do that I mean no I I Wild Card a few weeks ago so I had the Fairly template wild card team but no Diaz which has been a good move but then you know the Sano Smith row eth attacker kind of like rotation thing so I don't know I you could so there's might be some opportunities to um fiddle around with stuff but again I don't know who is a screaming by this week as we've talked about so I think if you um I think uh wat like let's say like you had the luxury of not really needing to make any big changes this week um I think uh Watkins would be someone Target yeah well you already have him but I just just in general yeah oh we're switching to just general yeah yeah sorry actually good actually speaking of a good question in the chat around Spurs of you know they're scoring goals but and Brendan this is your pet pet topic of do you want someone a team to Target that's scoring a lot of goals but it's spread out or the concentrated of the Spear of low scoring T I know you feel strongly about this but it is frustrating to have soleni and then four goal game and nothing um so that's super frustrating but it seems kind of fluky though exactly I don't know can we see itos can we see it first well he's he's done it two yeah I know you're trying to rope me into Simmons talk here uh but it's uh I mean he's he's had returns in the two previous weeks right solank so I I we we we have been seeing him kind of round into fantasy shape he hasn't I don't think he's had a big match right I don't think we've seen him like even that's like get like multiple attacking returns in a match so far I just think to watch him play he is it's so much hold up play from him and uh I think like some spurs fans would suggest that an will change those tactics depending on the opponent and I think West Ham would be you know given their vulnerability on crosses and set pieces still it didn't feel like salanki was a huge part of that plan for him to be getting the final ball still he was playing very well as a hold up player but it's just I'm not seeing the the the huge fantasy ceiling for I think and actually I think I just pulled up his stats he actually had attack returns in three matches in a row before this one takes along but he's not you want the double digits so maybe sun sun is the possible yeah outside play and they're a little tricky too because you can see uh three matches in a row three attacking returns you before this blank uh and yet uh no bonus in any of those matches right and so that does get to the other problem of the the kind of old school back when man city were scoring four or five goals a match you kind of needed to have KD b or you know Aguero and if you had a like I was always tempting to get a Bernardo silver type player right because they'd always one of the cheapest options in there de Silva I suppose back when he was there you know but um but often they would get one attack in return and no bonus right and so it's like you're like ah is this worth 7.5 million or whatever and so maybe maybe we are a little bit there with salani I think the problem is um I don't know I mean like what about bernon Johnson Dave I mean you're a sports supporter like mean he's he's been great yeah he's on fire that could be a p but again it's like it's the price thing you're just like well he's not I don't mean to B down but like who's exciting to bring in it's like he's so cheap he's almost not exciting you're like million in the bank that's not fun just psychologically but is the move I know I think that's one of the reason I didn't bring him in this week either I I just couldn't get excited enough about it you know if BR Johnson was 10.2 we'd all have him yeah yeah it's so true isn't that funny the way that works sometimes I know it's so true and and I don't know Palmer the still the fixtures are not great I think what I'll I'll give a shout out to the content creators of so you know hey Palmer's banging him in but the pictures are going to turn so is he really a buy and he hasn't it's been tough because fixtures create points so yeah I mean and he's still okay took four shots today uh he had a big chance in the first half I think uh or bigest chance I mean it was a big chance for him I don't you know maybe for a lesser player that's a low percentage chance but he did a uh I you know this was always going to be a really tough match for him um and uh I think Newcastle at home I'd actually be very surprised if he didn't get some kind of attack and return in that one but you guys sort of um we we gloss over uh Watkins for a second I mean I do think that there's there is some potential there the question is I guess like let's say you were scared off of foden uh but maybe you know but maybe you do want to drop cipa this week ahead of the Run could you maybe go um I don't know how much it depends how much money you have in the bank already but a move that was like Watkins to um uh you know uh what yeah Lewis for example excuse me where we going CBA CBA to Lewis big yeah CBA to Lewis would free up like you know .5 million roughly I think some somewhere in that maybe a little less than that actually maybe like 1.2 million now uh and maybe then you could go Chris Wood or somebody you whatever whoever your third forward is you could upgrade to Watkins and I that wouldn't be terrible I mean but then after this week Watkins has Spurs away Liverpool away Chelsea away three in the next four after boras so he's almost like a get off I was actually looking at the to drop so I don't know like he's like a hold for this week but after that I don't know yeah they have a home fixture midweek on Tuesday against bolognia for the Champions League certainly uh is that it good us some pork as well or get us in pork yeah yeah it's there's some distance between Billa pork and and goodison pork uh but the the pork pies are stronger through that entire Corridor the bolognia spr yeah try the fried bolognia sandwich um certainly I'm holding my transfers until we see those those Champions League what what are the fixers this week in the Champions League so yeah you've got Villa hosting uh bologna you always get soemo yeah it looks like that's the only Premier League club that's that's playing on Tuesday then on Wednesday you've got Man City hosting Sparta praha uh Liverpool away Arby leig which may be the the trickiest of them let's see I'm just hunting around for the Arsenal Champions League fure AG with you as if following Champions League in America wasn't hard enough cuz all working this new is diabolical these pictures are crazy I can follow it it's like it's it's a mix of one of the most difficult fixtures you can imagine or the easiest fixer you played all season are we sure it's I like that's champ arsal Arsenal host uh shakar donet on Tuesday so Villa and Arsenal uh both home on Tuesday and uh then City at uh okay Liverpool on on Wednesday so should have Europa League as well right on on Thursday yeah you yeah so so let's see I'm I'm really yeah man man united uh are away at fer aach on Thursday hunting around here for uh let's see blah blah blah blah blah right there blah blah blah go up a little bit go up a little bitar okay yeah thank you for finding that and reading that uh Chelsea are away in Greece at panthia nakos but you know as as discussed with Cole Palmer he's not on their roster for oh he's still not on the okay no I don't think they submit a new roster until they get out of the group stage of the competition so he's free and easy I mean he's it's interesting you bring up like Palmer is such a difficult player to not own right now because he he is that guy but they have bad fixtures when is the right moment to get him I do feel like the Newcastle fixture is good enough to just go for Palmer and I am think I'm considering ways to downgrade celba or another player in my 11 to upgrade Anthony Gordon to Palmer that would probably require actually three transfers so would not take a minus four just to get polymer in the midst of this run but I do feel like that is a great fixture for or you could down or you could downgrade Salo because as we saw today his returns were totally fluky and you got lucky so yeah that's can't I got lucky playing the variance with most the variance game with with him as unsustainable like yeah Ninth Place alltime Premier League goal scorer what would you guys do if you had what would you guys do if you had Diaz get rid of him yeah no it's I think so too off the boil yeah and unfortunately because there's another um International break coming up in November uh it it does seem like you and I Brandon were're talking about this morning AR slot does seem like a manager who's going to use the whole Squad I Salah is like one of those players he's like the sock you know he's like the he's a he's a movable he also came back early from the international break which made it even easier uh but I think um it you basically as we have we are now seeing it for real right which is there are four players for five slots up front we'll see about jod he went off you injured solve that too yeah yeah but either way and Cody I thought was pretty um geeko I thought was kind of irrelevant he was very quiet Darwin came on and put himself about he was like Mr dark arts against Chelsea this weekend but I thought that Liverpool benefited from that he was kind of distracted some of the Chelsea Defenders so as far as slot saw it I think would be pleased with Darwin's performance yeah yeah solah could work his way behind him it seemed like when he was pushing up front was good for him and what about you brenon in terms of your transfers yeah so I think if I look at my squad the the problem players are celba with the red card and I feel like it's I'm good going without Arsenal defense right now I thought it it feels like a coupon that the league gave us I was telling you this Josh where when that wild card turn happened around gameweek six that was when riot and Gabrielle Gabrielle was scoring his set pce goals looked Unstoppable Rya was getting a lots of FPL returns as well and then people moved off of CBA to get those guys and that there is the double Arsenal defense because we didn't wild card at that time we still had CBA so now we're in a position to just like for free basically just get off of the Arsenal defense train while they go through this rough B batch of fixtures but if you have Rya and Gabrielle I'm not sure you can find a good enough reason to get rid of them so yeah certainly not right and the thing is once they get past this Trio of rough fixtures it's it's it's a fantastic run uh for them right right right so you kind of just have to weather the storm even if it will be a storm we don't know Arsenal are good enough to to certainly clean sheet in any any fixture so it's really CBA and Gordon and I need to just look at more options in terms of downgrading CBA does that open up something more interesting for Gordon to become right because if you let's say let's say you did like the one of the cheapest options which was you took you turn cbos around 6 million into um maybe a little more or less into um like Mel Leno one 4.3 uh that would open upe that would free up 1.7 million for you yeah it's still not enough for me to turn Anthony Gordon into Palmer I mean it's it's enough for me to turn HTS into Ali Watkins so and HTS I guess is the tertiary player on the bubble for me where even though he's had a good run he's been great for Arsenal this season I think uh given the shape that Arsenal team is in they're not probably not going to be scoring three or four goals anytime soon although as Dave said the the run for Watkins gets worse after game week nine it's probably not it's it feels like longterm probably not like that that that's a transfer that it's hard to like net out super ahead on that you know if if if hars plays 90 in midweek and and the team looks a little ragged hars might move closer to my uh maybe he gets turned into to Watkins plan um but W Watkins has the same midweek week issue so I've got a lot of sort of balls in the air here yeah the other sort of elephant in the room for me is wild card but that to me wild card is all about how I'm going to do premium asset structure and I think still optimally assuming everyone's healthy it feels like Holland plus Saka plus Palmer and I need I feel like I want a wild card in order to get that and there are too many things in motion right now yeah it's not a good doesn't feel like a good week to make that put a steak in the ground for I I think I think in in two weeks time when Arsenal's fixer run gets really good yeah that is a great time for you to wild card because you could you could go you could go to three options right and you'd be sort of it'd be a good time to reset a little bit uh as far as my team um just because I've got it pulled up here I will uh I'll pick my team for next week 27 points that's brutal yeah I know I'm telling you bud it's it's been a rough run start putting out some fake info to help your I know exactly yeah so this is my my squad right now for uh for game week nine it looks okay um you know it's it's it's like it's an acceptable Squad like if I had to uh do nothing I would actually be okay with that uh like if I were Dave I would probably just save my transfer and have three uh but you know I think there might be an opportunity here because I do have two transfers to change things around a little bit I think it really feels like it's kind of last chance City for for E I would really like to see him do something uh in on in Monday's match to to feel confident uh in holding on to him I mean I think uh yeah I mean who do um Palace Palace host Spurs I mean it's honestly not a bad fixture for him but uh so like that that doesn't feel like the most urgent uh issue uh it would be great to get another man city asset and so um I could look at as something as simple as CBA to gardial would be would be an option um I guess in that case it probably Robinson I don't know you know it's like maybe hold one of my other transfers that might be that might be a possible move vardy I would like to drop eventually but I don't necessarily need to do that I mean Tren away to Arsenal like not great but probably fine like it's not something that I'm like again no one's keeping clean sheet so uh so moving like wasting a lot of money on Defenders feels which I know kind of undermines my gardial point but because it's Southampton they've been so bad this season you could make an argument for that like there's the upside is there for guardal there's a chance of like a 15 Point level return um and that's something worth worth shooting for so I mean I don't know you guys looking at my squad do anything else stand out to you as like an urgent not having Saka remains a big problem but I think I can fix that in a couple weeks I don't think that's a problem right now yeah not for the liverp not for the next couple weeks I don't necessarily want them right now so yeah yeah no I think to your point yet your weakest links are pretty like luxury moves so it's your it's your bench uh that might be the weakest link with G the Greaves injury and the celba suspension you have no Defenders to rotate or cover so but but uh you know you wouldn't look to upgrade gaves serious hamstring injury he's out for a month my goodness yeah so that could be mind games that's that's true who knows yeah yeah usually those things are like based on like lit like a literal comment from a manager it's like oh a few weeks few weeks time we'll see them I I do subscribe Brandon though to the theory of if if you lose a Defender you're losing a maximum of two points score anyway so yeah and maybe that's the the the secret benefit so the the F up to five free transfers you talk about that like a mini Wild Card well it's actually an interesting strategy for fixing your bench because if you want need to fix your bench and you have one or two free transfers you're kind of limited in what you can do and you often make compromises in terms of how creative you can be if you had three or four transfers you really fix your bench and do something interesting with one or two starting players so it you know I think you can weather weather a benching storm for for one game I look at my yeah like if I look at my squad right now and you you sort of look at my 11 and I just were to swap out Robinson for um gardial then I'd have a squad that I really liked for for game week and I I know like for podcast listeners they are not looking at my squad right now but it's a pretty it's it's you know I've got Watkins Holland VY up front uh Momo Rogers Palmer e again all fine right and then uh I mean e I don't know like arguable but like I mean Spurs are just like conceding goals for fun so like I you know it feels like that that's a match where he could he could do something uh it's almost baked into their their their approach right Henderson but I'm not GNA waste a transfer on on a keeper and um and then you know K is fine I mean even Robinson would be okay um I just don't really uh expect F to keep a clean sheet in that match although they did a way to Forest in a kind of similar match a few weeks ago so yeah aren't the most consistent so yeah yeah exactly so that's that's where I am um let's let's wrap things up here with just a couple of questions um you know Shane asked about thoughts on Defender strategy I think we covered that already so um Sam C asked about um he says Salah with more points than Holland um he says by the time this match finishes and almost three million cheaper is kind of crazy if you think about it it's solid as expensive as he is it's three million cheaper than Holland um can we swerve Holland and have some extra cash to spread around of course I blame the content creator Cal for not telling me Sal is good yeah that is a joke um yeah but um okay so let's say after Southampton kind of regardless of what Holland does is it is it time to to consider moving him on or are we just rearranging deck chairs trying to like find the right premium yeah I mean I mean Salah is good I don't know what to say I mean like we saw it today we're just like is he really go by watching that match like he's gonna get pens ass sure and assists and I don't you'll take along but I don't know like clearcut I'm talking over you Dave but I've got a really interesting point to make I was looking at you your Sol had no clear-cut goal scoring opportunities and open play it was the pen and then he was creating chances for his teammates I still think he's he's below Palmer Saka and Holland on the premium asset list all right um yeah I I I I think so I think it's pretty it's pretty tight between all four of them again if I the other strategy that I could do this week and I'll maybe I'll give a little more thought would be to just keep saving transfers and stick to my guns and ultimately downgrade civa and Trent and try to turn e into Saka which would give me Saka Palmer Holland and and allow me to kind of stick to my guns this idea that you just want three out of four of these premium assets um so that would be one option too I'd have to like do a little um investigating how honestly I could actually get Rico Lewis and that that might be enough uh if I turned SBA Lewis Trent into like a 4.5 that probably would be enough for me to turn as in s Saka so that's another possibility too um all right so final questions from Al Aloha Lounge she says uh has foden done enough to prove to pep pep to prove to pep that he needs to start no tell no I mean I mean historically or like it's like who knows I mean like uh how do you prove you're over long Co Dave you you've had long Co for four years now you tell me I'm sorry I shouldn't make fight we haven't seen how Pep's shirts look after foden has ironed them I assume this is how you prove your value to guardal it's the little things like picking up the dry cleaning and and sort of like washing the dishes and and that sort of thing how good is the tea that foden is brewing there in the staff cafeteria well I I slept through the game so you guys tell me how he looked but um foden I mean he didn't start for one yeah well that's not a good sign yeah so he's not yeah and he and he didn't influence the game at all after coming on apart from taking a well taken Corner uh to deliver the Jon Stones goal so that goes also back the Holland question of okay then what city asset are we just not having City players like it just seems crazy and then what's the alternative like premium assets and there's not like super ones this week so that's where I just I just feel like keeping Holland is just sensical but I'm open to it I guess w we weren't we podcasting like months ago about like you can't have everybody they're all everyone's so good and now we're going through this like e where it's like no one's quite there Happ with the pictures I mean that's yeah yeah it just so happens we're in a sort of transition week with fixtures too so yeah um oh I guess I'm going to actually be in 28 points Brandon once I once I get that Robinson Point subbed in there you go things are looking up for old Josh Landon all of a sudden VY somehow nicked a bonus Point while we were talking today he has gained a bonus Point how why is this happening this year all of a sudden these bonus points like Josh is a good actor I see the DMS open with FPL Towers negotiating the first party pump and dump scheme I know with this yellow cards get punished too much in this game in my opinion uh there's too many punishment oh you want to talk about BPS scoring system yeah oh that's everyone's favorite topic right U all right so I think um end the stream yeah yeah all right so I think that oh I had one final question for you guys which was basically um we talked a little bit about Lewis we talked a little bit about um gardial a little bit foden are there any other I mean because the South Enda match is obviously a fantastic match are there any other possible fantasy assets on man city I know they're the champions league as a factor and you know that but but let's say that we kind of get a predictable Champions League 11 is there is there anybody um I think you named plenty that's all we need okay like like there's no like because I mean like there could be Defenders or yeah is there any Edge in any or any or even other Defenders you know like I'm just curious is there any Edge to be gain from picking someone who's off off the tablein is the choice and he's not a choice you'll talk yourself into getting Bernardo Silva or doku and these are these These are paths to to pain yeah yeah I guess I guess you're right um all right so there there we are um and um uh I think that's it I think we can wrap this up guys yeah and um thanks everyone for

doing a live recording today this is the first time you and i have done a weve done in person before but in person with like the new setup on youtube its all new and different were also not usually next to each other like this weve done some like london trip side by side youre familiar with the wedding photographer a thing of like youre going to have to get close together like closer than youre comfortable doing just to make the shot you were saying the man of constant sorrow old brother and speaking of brothers were here with producer dave i am a man there we go dont know the rest of words nice to see right on so were here to talk about our terrible gw eights i think im the only one of the three of us who had mosala today so i experienced some joyful emotion on sunday you ended up what 8 10 12 points all told 12 points from mo so then the great regret is its always in hindsight well i should have been more courageous and i should have captain mosala instead of holland so one thing were going to have to talk about on this episode is holland has three blanks in a row were for all of the people who didnt believe the theory of no roger new no de bruyne is going to eat away at hollands points potentially and then some people are saying it was me however it is it is saints next week for man city so we theres no way out for holland owners once you think youre going to get out this southampton pulls you back in its tricky though because i think the question now is iide a vacuum loading up on man city players ahead of the saints match would make a lot of sense but its weirdly i still dont feel confident theyre going to keep clean sheet even against saints like i feel like somehow theyre going to have one moment where they just get sloppy and can see a goal and i also dont know what midfielder i would have it may be that you have to wait until the champions league this week to see if to see if like i was saying like if bernardo silva doesnt start in the champions league like he might be someone to target if foden doesnt start in the champions league i dont know if that makes me feel better or worse about him starting at the weekend there are a few paths for me to get foden without at without being at the expense of like a premium mid where the whole arsenal bournemouth match is another thing that were going to have to unpack but celba owners now have a free role on a cheaper defender assuming you dont want to stick with arsenal defense and i dont think we can make a real case for that right now but that is a great place to make money to upgrade in my case anthony gordon to somebody like foden right but were still waiting for foden to do something this season you were just reading about the covid conspiracy someone well i dont know its a conspiracy but someone in our app replies said that co phen recently had covid and then hes still recovering from it that he may potentially have long co okay so i dont know well so were not were not doctors dave are you a doctor no but i play one on the podcast dr dave okay well that would be a rational explanation were trying to figure out whats happening with foden youre like theres something going on but its been happening for years so has he had long co for years maybe is he patient zero is what we need to figure out last year he was starting matches this early in the season right like his fbl returns last season are pretty solid i think it was they have double digit goals and assists last year somewhere in that range at least pfa player of the year its hard to deny no were not here to talk about fodens talent level were here to talk about the mystery of whats going on at man city and like that performance against wolves felt in some ways similar to the performance against arsenal where they had to hammer away at a good defensive performance from wolves until they finally got the breakthrough at the very end also it felt a little bit like city playing fen last two weeks ago where the chances that wolves got were on the counter and were pretty good chances and one of them they finished and the other they simply didnt so it could be looking a lot worse for city right now on the table but liverpool now one point ahead can we start talking about liverpool as like title cont not like its farfetched to imagine that this stacked team would be title contenders but arsenal are just like quickly fading away from this discussion now were back to the glory days of city versus liverpool and i think this was the match the arsenal bournemouth match and we lets do what lets do a little reset here im freestyling here i enjoy your freestyling but we put together this nice running order and i think that we should try to stick to it so lets lets kick things off so game week eight kicks off with the spurs spurs west ham match on saturday morning you and i go to smithfield hall meet up with a listener that was nice shout out to fpl rock on twitter darren wonderful guy enjoyed chatting with him hes been and seen football played all over planet earth so its just interesting hearing what hes seen and also his fpl thoughts he run some fpl content out of a podcast in cuba got some spanish content so that was that was very cool so shout out to darren thanks for coming out and the scene is always good at smithfield hall its a west ham supporters bar as well as a man utd bar so we walked into great sorrow and then we emerged victorious with a very man utd fans just cant understand how they got away with it right i think that it was right so the match on saturday morning though was pretty interesting right i think you had a little bit of saka drama which we can talk about more in a second but one option was to move saka to sun which that was the only move that would have worked out this week you did get a foden assist late right but like thats not four points not that significant but i think what was the bigger news was that you had poro blank brennan johnson blank and blank in a four in a four goal spurs match which i feel like that like it just the whole vibe this week was a real post international break like a little some shaky i thought the matches today for example were like surprisingly low quality i thought the spurs or not the spur the chelsea liverpool match i thought was foul heavy and and the man city wolves was just odd like i just felt like it was it was such a especially the second half it was just a like a real slog and weve seen a lot of that with man city recently youre looking for much more dynamism from man city they seem to just insist that they can pass through any low block but ultimately i think they just need more players be it greish doku saevinho who can just beat a man and theyre that just to create something in the box which makes it even more confusing as to why fodens roll out has been so slow because he is good at operating in those tight spaces and he could certainly help holland had precious few touches one or two moments that could have easily been goalscoring opportunities but youre left feeling like not awesome about holland and this city team despite that victory so lets get into i think like just to go through the weekend which i think might be a cleaner you want we want to talk what do we just want to talk about sunday and should we just keep it you want you want to work backwards here brandon because we just we just saw these matches so maybe working back maybe we just we scrapped the running order already this lovely running order that we put together this morning what are your fpl takeaways from liverpool chelsea i think my takeaways are that chelsea are not a defensive team there was that moment where i think that sanchezs value was inflated by the pens save the 15p pointer that he got y and then they ran into some yellow card suspensions and there was a lot of like ingame rotation with the backline from moresa against chelsea so you were saying you feel like moresa rotates too much too much like what that i feel like mesas hit upon something with chelsea that is certainly working in the attack in the attack aspect but now he just needs to find some cohesion and some continuity and hes not doing that at all and i hes just working with the situation that he got where he had two big of squad and hes just trying to challenge these players to show him where that continuity was would be but i still think its palmer or nobody from the attack nicholas jackson did have a pretty good goal though so if you have ridden out a small drought with nico jackson suddenly you should be booed by what happened hes the cl he is the like one of those players that can be hard to evaluate in fantasy because he has like truly terri body language like when you watch him play he looks like hes absolutely miserable out there hes in that like who we put in there its like mesit ozil famously was a bad body language player but who else was like i feel like they were missing some other of course brandon always with the what do you think dave might for getting a bad body language player here how do you rate your body language dave right the great thing about new york is theres so much to see and do im think thinking about that they might be giant song but my body language right now its its hurting but it was good early in the week and then just as the games have gone on like you like you said these sunday games its just dragging us down it has nothing to do with you going to raves and for exactly rolling in exactly but i like to finish that point on chelsea the wingers as good as they are individually theyre still trying to find like its does feel like moresa wants netto to work and and sancho did not have a great game mow is just feast or famine with him fantasy wise so like as much potential as there is with chelsea then you get to liverpool your feelings on liverpool so you only have trent how are you feeling about trent is that a good use of money for you at the moment hes honestly been fine when i think about how my seasons gone so far trents performance is not at the top of the list by any means getting three consecutive blanks from holland has honestly been a bigger problem for me considering this week was a little bit different this week he was heavily captain the last two weeks though he was a little bit of a differential captain it didnt come through at all and so my i have like just larger problems with man city that im trying to figure out i ive dodged at bola by not having rico lewis like thats one of the like thats one of the few thats worked out reasonably well but i thought salah had a real like a modern salah performance right where he like like he struggles to take people on still but now hes now hes heads up looking for the pa which has unlocked another aspect of his game and you saw him trying a lot from wi to find his teammates in this match as you have through a lot of this season so as i am ive been like over the last few weeks looking for the jumping off point to move salah to either saka or palmer and after this weekend i think im gonna gota keep going with salah though i me they play arsenal away in gw nine so but what would your palmer lets see palmer plays newcastle next week and newcastle are a total mess right now and anthony gordon has just been hes hes turned from differential into just like weirdly killing my game weeks from his miss pens to the blanket home against brighton so that is a huge opportunity i think for palmer against newcastle in gw nine i think so is that worth a transfer that would be the question like is it worth so you have two transfers right going into game week n as do i dave do you have did you make a transfer this week or you no i have five i think do you i think i wow thats amazing so you got to five ive been waiting for someone to get to five transfers i think hold on let me double let me live check here right no i got four sorry okay is that right one more week to go dave i think i could roll i could roll wow because youre doing youre like what like a 3k right now in the world something like that i whos counting no i think i saw that you and dave are roughly exactly in the same position good so hes doing equally terrible thats great the seven figures me too sadly on 30 points right now thank you mo i did terribly on saturday the only thing i got was a goal from morgan rogers it was blanks from hovers the minus three from celba and just bad news all around fulham didnt just didnt coales even though well okay im already moving to saturday but just for my team you are you got like a youre all over the place right now talk about fh i think its cuz the camera is on you and youre youre feeling like a lot of pressure its like albert brooks and broadcast news but in your 30 points with just dean henderson to go like 65m gw rank moving me to around 16m overall so ill certainly be finishing on a red error for the week and im just waiting for the moment to kick on man i think a lot of people are feeling that way im on 26 i have e and henderson to go and so im im feeling the same i was feeling okay going into this match and i if id gotten anything from palmer or trent i would feel okay about this week but im already looking at the i think the average score is 31 so im already five under average and so its its and e hasnt done anything the entire season right one attacking return in eight weeks so or seven weeks well see what he does tomorrow so but i think its one of those weeks where its its its like a good week to have a bad week as they say theres its not like theres a massive swing or anything like that so dave what about you like how are you looking on your points so far this weekend 20 something like everyone else 24 25 watkins and rogers well talk about ful them but like we said tomorrows game is gonna be the clinch the f hammerwood i got go e its its g to be a its g to be an interest moving a move week thats true and i have henderson so maybe henderson ill have a fantastic match i am on 27 because i get i get one point off the bench i get robinson in for greaves i thought robinson had a yellow but apparently he didnt he put they put a yellow up on the screen at least on the us version of the broadcast and it was an errant graphic apparently he comes through with a clean one should we take a quick moment we because were recording early on saturday weve got some more uk listeners in the youtube chat our friend fpl yellow army also sebastian front also has five free transfers so thats a were on the lookout for these rare people these unicorns the are there any questions in the chat we had a we had a an addition to the bad body language of bruno bruno hes a great hes a great bad body language player for that was an interesting moment in that man utd match where there was an a camera angle on bruno where i thought he had joined the turkish hair transplant brigade his hair just looked full this weekend for some reason so but i backed away from that theory and i just feel like i need to say bruno your hair looked you had a great hair day on saturday thats remember when sal used to have the long hair and it was just like not a great i bet it looked cool off the pitch but it was like it didnt did not work on if it rained it was not a great look that hair had bus in it though that hair did have goals in it thats thats a fair point thats a fair point all right well lets so lets return back to saturday as you were saying its i think the fulam villa match its i think might take away morgan rogers scored a goal watkins scored a goal i dont think theres anything super dramatic in that my big fantasy take away from that match would have been that r jimenez got the full 90 minutes took scored a goal early a nice goal as well and played i thought pretty well through outout he only had the one the one big chance but i think if theres been a little bit of hesitation around him just because of his injury history and stuff like that i this feels like the season where were all struggling to find that cheap third forward and maybe maybe that doesnt exist maybe its chris wood honestly hes hes the only consistent one i i want to ask brandon about what he feels about himen is because i saw after the match hes the top value forward on mel tfs table holland a buy brandon why not f ful are an attacking team if nothing else right now and muns just hes lost his spot to raul had a fantastic international break with mexico scoring a screamer and f do have good fixtures right terrific run everton brenford palace wolves in the next four thats a strong run i although one other takeaway from saturday is two clean sheets in a row for every they have red the ship and we i dont know about you guys i just assumed this would happen eventually it was it was like they last season they had they had a ton of injuries to start the season right and so we and even now they brth weight is still not back although he should be soon and thats one of the unfortunate things is that probably michael keane who had a great match today or le from nel perspective hes at 41m but i think you have to avoid ke unfortunately because i do think that he had been dropped for br branway last year and so i think hes a dub but you did have the michael kane though remains a great actor michael kane fantastic see when he scores points his voice the trip that was good we needed that dave but i but speaking of everton i think that for anyone whos looking like you and i like one of the things that screwed us is one reasons that you and i and many others are on less than 30 is he has a cba right and not just getting negative3 from him but the fact that anyone who had rya got hurt by that eliminated all of arsenals attacking potential in that match sure it hurt me having hovers the damage was already done to saka owners so saka being a miss there was just it was an interesting wave waveform of content leading up to the game we talking about saka andy martin i think probably had the cleverest thing where he drove down to arsenals hotel in bournemouth and took a photo of himself and where they had saw the team getting off the bus to do a height comparison to see hes based hes based in south africa too so thats thats incredible commitment so i hope you have diamond status andy to afford that flight because to do that last minute is crazy theres a lot of sturm and drang about who knew what do we know anything josh about team sheets what do you mean do you getting inside leaks right so okay i okay i wouldnt know the first thing of how to get them to be hon so you and so you and i thought about this and so just for anyone who isnt on twitter and congratulations if you arent thats thats fantastic good on exactly and twitter is a is a dying social media network that has now been like its primarily fpl as far as i can tell its like those are the people who are like hanging on and theyre just everyone is absolutely furious with each other and this is like this been going on for like a year and a half i bowed out like unfortun ive now turned twitter into like a place where i just like share like podcast information fpl twitter is like going to a sunday family dinner with your like extended relatives right often it is cordial but you all know that you all secretly hate each other or its its like a its like a family trip that go thats one day too long and and i just think u okay the c i have a couple of thoughts about this and so the issue was that there was a lot of information about saka or a lack of information about saka and most of the people who are making fpl i dont like the phrase content creators i dont know why but like a lot of people who make fpl youtube videos and podcast whever werere advocating to keep saka and thats where we i just my rationale was that he always starts he always starts artetta is not one of these managers like if artetta says that hes close to starting my expectation is that he probably will start its not like i dont think its like whereas other managers likeed eddie how for example right you genuinely have no idea like if how says that eso is we plan to have him start tomorrow that means its like 5050 right like you genuinely cant believe what he says but i think and so there was a lot of debate about this and then it turned out like all of these people dropped saka and you and i cool guys that we are didnt even have saka so we were able to avoid we had no one to drop we had no one to drop so and dave you had you had saka yourself right and so you kept him youre also in the club i was in was in the we all family in the club no that was my thought too its like worst case scenario hes not in squad get sing off the bench at sano for sub so its that was a pretty easy solution but like we were talking about before i think it was a sound theory because the pictures coming up are turning for saka they with no odog guard hes looking all off so but i they also the al alternatives werent super clean like its a double transfer to palmer or its foden who we all we already talked about is a risk and i love foden but so was a risk too a little bit and inconsistent as well hes got a sun has not been a like a super reliable fantasy this season sun was clearly past fit for the weekend but i agree with you both like it was spurs were in at least some goal scoring form without him you never know how slowly angrew is going to want to bring him back there so there was some risk there too but that turned out to be the best move i think in some ways that were a little bit on the outside of this of this world because a lot of the content that we do were not were not doing a lot of deadline streams right were not like talking to 10 minutes before partially because we dont were were still asleep when the deadline hits right its like the deadline is 6 am east coast time it is not i am not up at in most cases every now and then if its like if its crucial ill ill do it but in general im not waking up at 515 to check things im just im going with it and so i think so we dont necessarily get like hit by this stuff as much but i think this theres an idea out there that and like this just speaks i think a little bit and i like forgive me if im going off fpl here a little bit but like just the relationship that people have with people who create content a little bit and this idea that like hey you were saying to me yesterday hey like no ones making like a ton of money on this theres this belief that theres this ivory tower in which somebody who makes just go to i implore you to go to our youtube channel and look at the quality of this were what i shing the camera we okay well okay back up i there youre talking about us here by the way im in joshs house right now and i dont know the money seems to be rolling in here so you are in a parlor so but none nonetheless the point is that there is this like class structure and content creators are a like reaping this incredible revenue from it while not doing any work like the people who do make money from it like work their tails off and we so whatever that would be the point can i ask you a question though about that so even putting the money aside or including the money even whats the incentive to lie right does that mean youre going to watch more contribute to someone who lies to you whats the whats the game theory of this im not understanding theres some edge in duding three or 400 people or whatever right about what youre doing its like theres theres 12m people or whatever 11m people playing fantasy like the amount of people that you would gain an edge on is so small right and well youre not making money by playing fpl because that would be against the rules right well theres that too so i dont understand like what even is the argument of why but i think thats the sub i think thats the subex the subtext of people getting mad about this stuff is that that they are doing it to get an edge over the opposition right i think that to me is what people are mad about this idea that theres like they have secret knowledge theyre not sharing in order to like get more rank and i think youre rightly making the case and again we dont need to like belabor this because even so like andy said he might change it two days before i watched a video so i dont see where people get this and just this idea that like that people have i dont think theres that much im in plenty of like dm threads with like these exact people and a lot of them like i believe me like a lot of them are talking minutes before the deadline trying to like casting about asking everybody else if they know anything right its not like its not like theres like this secret feed and we know the cheaters are pro leaks you guys will share any leaks no ones ever done it though its a the problem is our listen base pro right there proof were breaking conspiracies here live i think its its ultimately to our benefit that our listener base is not a twitter base and so its so funny like i think of my friends no and louise who are producers of the pod and every now and then ill talk to them and theyre just they do not pay attention to any of this stuff and they think like its insane that anybody does and im like thats probably like the approach even though they manage a fantasy team the joy they derive is is watching the matches on the weekend and exactly and they have a mini league of their own and i we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and that a lot of the anger that people have about fantasy stems from caring about overall rank right and i think that this is just something i think like maybe this like has to be like a theme for us this year which is like invest in your mini leagues and invest in headtohead leagues invest in stuff that you can do with smaller groups of people where you have a better chance of winning because if your goal is to finish in the top 10000 out of 11m people your odds are about as good as as like its not like winning the lottery but its about like about as good as arsenal winning the league you say exactly youre talking about investing time id say theyre lower than that talking about time investment right time in all of it so its just like its its just not i just think like i think our goals should be focused on and like find like find like again like yes watch the matches andjoy them find moments of joy in that of course but i think just like looking purely from a fantasy point of view if youre if youre only thinking about overall rank its probably a quick way to just spend a lot of week and i feel guilty of this too spend a lot of time getting frustrated right like if i asked you like right now i am feeling frustrated my season right im like in the millions like davis and youre not that far into the hundreds thousands 16m are you exactly so like were all like a rough season and but if i look at like and i have to force myself to do this right but if i looked at our mini leagues even like the ones that are like more competitive or i would like to win i maybe 30 points back 35 like its nothing right theres 30 weeks to go in the season like its so long plus the mystery chip thats g to change everything exactly maybe the mystery chip will just be like you click the button and you get the leaks you get the leaks or its like or its like a lottery and its like you just hit a button you get like someone gets an extra 100 points someone gets an extra 200 like who knows whats going to happen that the mystery chip yes well so thats thats whats going on thats an update on whats going on in the fpl twitter space speaking of conspiracies though do we need to go back to arsenal and talk about further red card drama for them i what did you make of the civa red card and like declan rice saying to the offical after the match it happens to us every week well thats just like thats a self every manager is full of selfpity and and as are a lot of like you mean like listen like its it to me its and everyones everyone who is like provar is gonna hate this but to me its like its another v problem which is that it force like theres no once you look at v theres no way not to call that a red card right because it is by every technical rule like off like its its hes the last man hes the last defender and so you have to do it but the referee on the pitch called it a yellow and that from a from like an enjoyment standpoint and ultimately from a fantasy standpoint too depending on how many arsenal assets you had its like its the its it like it made it made for a worse match right and so its like that is whats frustrating to me and i just think that v i dont know exa same play happened today against with liverpool chelsea where tosen took joe to down with first 10 minutes of the they didnt car c and michael oliver in the varo decided to stick with the yellow card ino which i think was smart it was like four i dont think he would arve you day it was like four seconds in he was like nope this were just not gonna call this right so you do feel for arsenal getting hit with all these like minor infractions that lead to red cards but iy it is fluky and i have this theory that i think artetta and anyone whos watched the all or nothing amazon documentary about ettas season with that season with arsenal where artetta is just a guy who enjoys putting out these like big brain nba theories about how to play football and how to be tactical and i think his weirdness is now in the heads of all of these arsenal players so theyre like overthinking all of these instances on the pitch and trying to gain an edge like artetta tries to gain an edge in the press conference room of like lying about players in status and then hes got his players on the pitch doing weird similar types of things but with trying to like walk that red card line or delaying the game and all that stff i think its i just think its fluky honestly and i think if you look at all the all the situations its you had a time wasting right thats thats isnt that what got trer knocked out of the match in the man city right its like time wasting and you had the dean rice i dont think should have been a red card it was a second yellow and a red but like i thought that one was like another was that was that time wasting too so same exact same thing that trer did so so two time wastings and then and then a technically accurate red card so i think that is all just like fluky stuff thatll that will get wiped away but i am curious about the clean sheet part of it and the and i think there is like a like an actual fpl angle to this and whether we think my feeling is this and you guys tell me if you disagree you had a lot of a lot of international tournaments this summer right and so a lot of players came back late a lot of top players especially defenders center like a bunch of center backs top clubs were playing not ben white as we all know but many others of course now hes a right back mostly but i think that you so they didnt necessarily have enough time to practice together and i think that i think there so a little bit of that a little bit of theres so much money in the premier league now that even bouth level clubs can get like a vanon type players right like you just like you can like bring in like talented brazilians to be your forward even if youre like the 15th best team in the premier league imagine shakiri at stoke city its its that and so i think thats part of it too its just like its i dont think you get like in la liga or the bundesliga like this level of talent like at the in the bottom third of the of the league and so i think that affects clean sheets maybe like more increasingly but i but i do think ultimately long term that we will get there again and maybe this is just something that we just need to like think about going forward which is just dont focus dont invest too much money in your defense the first half of the season and the second half of the season is when you can start to turn the dial a little bit because i feel like we see this every single year with man city which is that they have this run where they caned a bunch of goals and then the final 10 weeks of the season no one can score on them right it is like they one nil their way to a title and i just dont i just think were going to see that again this year what do you guys think dave man city that theyre theyre a punchline defensively at least in fantasy terms how close are you as of today in considering a city defender for the run you brought this up and i just immedately said like you like i just ive gone through the ederson ringer weve all had like josh you said rico he is hes probably a buy still because hes starting every match right so he and he does get forward a little bit too will be the bandwagon during this transfer window because the run continues for city is he scored his second goal of the season and he finished last season so strong that people will remember that so i think cba to guardi is probably the algorithmic preference for going into gw nine thats interesting that makes a lot of sense im surprised i havent thought about that more seriously thats a pretty logical move i know but like you just said in that long point you made i think was good though i like why would we have that undermine the point i just made it makes a lot of sense can i spend more money on my defense ignore everything i just said and plus trent like if we have him and gabriel or sure thats why r loose might feel more tempting because you can use that money so what do how do you measure the upside of guiol is just the same with trent where youre just talking about the high ceilings but it has been so variable the returns on defenders that i im sure a an equally compelling case could be made to just getting all 45 well let well theres not that many good can you bring up the fpl hub heat map for guardal exactly i let me see if i can pull that up in real time splits pleas without things its getting too chaotic here but i am i am okay so lets lets say that like we like we believe what ive just said which is that you want to u maybe scale back a little bit on your defense and i feel this way a little bit about trent where i do wonder if that money could be spent invested in a in like a better third forward perhaps i have jamie vary at the moment like that cant last im gonna keep im gonna keep vard ponzi scheme is not i know exactly i did finally get a goal this week thankfully v pump and dump over here exactly that go exactly if we all get b its better for josh this if this were draft leue then id be even better id be trying to you switch him off but so hes got to go eventually and maybe theres like a i dont know like maybe i can find someone else it could just be i go back to chris wood but lets say that i want to start taking some money on my defense and put it in my midfield and forward lines and i think and maybe the other the other way would be that weve talked before about how you just want to try to have three out of four of these like expensive premium assets and that just may be the thing that you need to do and that youre going to always get something and i think we saw that this week right like saka didnt play but and when i say four im thinking saka holland palmer and salah right those are like the big four the big four fantasy assets this season i think and it seems like every single week youre gonna get like one of those will carry you if you have them now you could have had holland holland saka and palmer and palmer this week and that would have been three blanks but i think without saka playing i think if saka had played thats a totally different story im going to ask you hypothetical here josh and dave i want to hear your opinion too imagine holland blanks against southampton at home at the edy hod you laugh and you think like how improbable it is right but itll be four blanks in a row and in those blanks you have some weak opposition you look at the injuries surrounding the club how close would you be to dropping holland at if he were to blank against southampton is that a conversation to even entertain it wouldnt be at the top of my priority list still i want to make a decision off one week but also we had a question on the youtube of are you is this hurting the holland triple captain shout against south i think it talking about dumping him people are talking about triple captain him like hurts it i dont know i dont know how you can triple captain him at the moment like i think hell score this next weekend but if there was a say like foden im sorry well say foden and de bruyne returns from his injury midweek in the champions league and there was that dramatic a shift in how you expected man city to line up against southampton then potentially but yes as it is given the state of play i just cannot of fathom triple captaining holland right now what do you think dave i dont know maybe dibling in if they could do give it to dibling for the end of the season im thinking the other side the galaxy brand they keep leing goals val thats true dibling he 45 right im just im a like you josh i enjoy by the way on the on the patreon pod you go through some of the odds of the anytime goal scores i think right im ill be honest im a slave to those odds because like those are efficient markets usually and just hollands just always very good odds to do something so i dont see myself dropping them hly it is like they have to it feels like p figure this its a little bit like like we were talking about d and everton earlier its like this idea that things arent working and theyre not feeding the ball to holland is like a problem that cant be fixed is i think wrong right like in gandan and ver silva and phil foden whenever he gets over his long covid in the years to come i dont know i dont know who know im not im not planting that in the world that was just what somebody said in one of our replies i think that you have like eventually theyre going to figure maybe jack relish needs to get back in there like they need like somebody whos like a better creator right im not sure doku is as good of a creator as gish on the on the left and so i think that theyre and theyre missing rodry but i just i do think that pep is this is the premier leagues best manager and i think that hell eventually and eventually like as in like 20 weeks i think like by this weekend possibly hes going to figure it out but to go back to my question about defense lets say we wanted to take the money out looking at these fixtures like the next seven this i almost never look seven fixtures ahead by the way i think five or six is as far as i ever want to look this because too many things change to people get injured but are there a couple of teams that you would recommend somebody targeted if they were looking to drop cba or if they were looking to clear out money to bring in lets say saka gets a clean bill of health and its a terrible we to bring in saka lets say lets say you want to bring in palmer and you want to keep saka while youre doing it who would be some cheap defenders that you might look at i like still like nottingham forest great stats i am haunted by that assist that ana had against liverpool to hudson ooy earlier this season i think and they have at least two good fixtures coming up with youre haunted like cuzz you wanted to im haunted just in like i think about it all the time im not like it affected my life its like its like a 19th century like english novel spooky season i am doing a lot of opium though to go with the victorian theme so maybe that has something to do with what how i see ana everywhere but i do but they have lester away and then west ham at home and west ham just the implosion continues and even newcastle at home you have to like for forest so i think you mentioned everton before and everton have this newfound defensive form im curious about these fixtures though for everton fulham even though theyre hosting fulham are an attacking team very capable of scoring we talked about the run that raul is on and then probably the two best defensive fixures for everton are away from home with southampton and west ham and then they finish off this mini run of theirs with brenford at hosting at goodison pork park who is also pretty adept fork i wonder if thats a little stand that they have outside the stadium how could it not be how could the best the best sausage is this side of the the ts like this which i know is does not run as far north as that but so if im comparing everton and forest thats my little like te aet there im im going forest i was making a tiny shout for oogi as a cheaper route into the spurs defense the problem right now is youre not getting clean sheets anywhere right and so you ideally this is one of the reasons im not like dying to get rid of trent because im like well at least he has different like multiple routes to points right like sometimes ill fluke into a clean sheet and sometimes ill ill get an attack and return but ad doy has been like a reasonably attacking asset for for spurs and so he might be somebody poro is still the top por has set pieces over udi hes more consistent defensively he does shoot more he had a great opportunity offer a corner kick this on saturday and some would argue that van dean is roughly the same price as udi and maybe hes a little bit more con consistent i dont know udis had a very strange season hes had moments where hes been very defensively inept but thats just like a read outside of the fantasy game its just all about returns and i do see what youre seeing josh where he is getting into the box a bit more when theyre pushing down that left hand side of the pitch its just that hes 49m right so hes hes pretty cheap like you could you could move and they have had like a a pretty decent run of fixtures palace villa villas a tough fixture but then if switch and full li at home two of the three after that so i dont what do you think dave about the spurs defense in general its been a source of some frustration the last few weeks i think porro is the obvious move if youre going to do a ca replacement so but its not im not super excited and id have to consult the heat maps on new doggy i dont have a heat map here but por over here por 55m is poro so hes point6 more than than ad dogy but he does have its five blanks and six for poro as well which is a lot for like a to me its like if im if im going to get a defender that costs more than 5m i want so i i want to be a some return whether its a clean attack return like every other match right because its quite a lot of money when you can fluke your way into clean sheets with any old 45m well thats what im saying is it even worth it at that point because then just go for the clean sheets with like forest or brighton or anyone dice true and ad doys just got the one assist so far in the season youre not g to get a return from a defender every other game it seems like at the moment exactly maybe trent gets you the closest yellow makes a good point on the chat it was anthony elena who got that assist not well so im still haunted by ana im trying to figure out why its a spectre you cant you cant make out the shapes its its like a smoke smokey vision it could be grandma it could be grandma im not sure grandma thats i think thats the title for todays podcast it could be grandma and other thoughts on game week n all right well lets anything else that you want to discuss we can we can move on and talk about game week n in a second here but any other final thoughts on on the matches that we saw over the weekend i think we probably covered everything the one newcastle that is the one where i just its surprising to me theyve had a number of good fixtures and it just feels like the vibes are off magic we need a vibe shift with newcastle sometime soon it is all it all stems we thought that all of newcastles good fortune and good form stemm from jool linton at turned out it was kieran trippier the whole time and as he has faded from the team so has the form so all right i think its over for lets lets move on well lets talk about game week n just quickly before we do i wanted to give a quick shout out to everyone who sports the podcast on patreon you got to patreon including our friend over here hes not just our friend hes our patreon supporter maybe one day you can become a patreon supporter and be right in this room like subscribe like and subscribe dave is in the the frer its a 1000 a month well worth it its like a frat its like a frat its like initiation and everything no you can go to patreoncom thinking will occur after this recording again hey i dont make the rules you can go to patreoncom cheating to support the podcast you get an extra podcast each week we also do were on the were on the discord the discord is im honestly and i know i always say this and its it but it like the way it continues to evolve and expand its there are people in there who its its a its it it feels like its genuinely repl social media for a lot of people and i think in a way thats positive and theres lots of little sub i think because you and i are mods on there we like we see every little subgroup right and theres little theres little we see everything but theres these little south american i see what you and the norwegian channel are up to okay dont think that were not watching reading meets and theres like theres theres a betting channel and theres fashion and like music and nfl im the mod of nfl so youre the mod of nfl exactly theres nfl fantasy leag theres all kinds of stuff on there and so its a fun commun so if youre feel like if this saka situation and youre just like my god im just so sick of this stuff and you want to be somewhere where like things are just a little calmer and people arent screaming each other all the time you can go to patreoncom support the podcast and even at the lowest pledge level you get access to the discord and so thats just a nice way to maybe get some access to some new fantasy content and then were also were going to start a contest sometime soon i think we talking about maybe doing it before the second half this time around just because i know some people are getting a little frustrated with their overall ranks and it might be a chance to get to juice things up maybe well do it like after the next juice we have thankfully i know you guys are sick of the premier league already we got another national break coming up in a couple of weeks and so it might be a time to to kick off one weekend of premier league was plenty get me out of here i know exactly were already gearing up for the next ib so we should do like an off to thee side fpl challenge league its like you guys like i dont even know what fpl challenge is and you were explaining to me i was like sounds fun and if its a daily fantasy theres always you dont have to worry about your current team so maybe we can do like a second half like discord league with that its a little its a little bit like d and d where its like you need someone to be like the like like you need someone to like be the like what are they a dungeon master dungeon master you just need someone to be that was the word i thought it was then i was like i doubted myself at the last second but you need somebody to safe politically to say d master exactly im not going to get canceled for saying dungeon master no but its its a its like you need someone to whos like enthusiastic who leads the charge right and this goes back to the mini league thing we were talking about before too this is like patreon stuff aside but if you if youre not if the person who leads your mini league isnt like actively managing it or like engaging it maybe you need to be that person its like its like be the be the change exactly thank you obama thank thanks obama all right well lets move on then i want to look ahead to gw nine i think the captaincy we have a couple of questions too but just to kick things off captaincy i think is relatively straightforward this week right i think its gonna be i very hard for me to envision not going with ear and holland even with those blanks but if holland were to get injured or if there was some risk of him starting right theres some leak that comes out that hes not expected to start this match or that then i think you could you could consider umo right i think 100 hosting switch could be one and bomo blank this week for the first time in quite a while and just imagine having an asset where its surprising when they blank and his name is not erling holland right it was it was surprising to see im bomo blank this week and he has a plum home fixture apologies to our buddy james holland but ipswitch just have not got going this season at all and for all the talk about how wellmanaged they are and how theyre theyre like canny enough to play in the premier league they are a team to target at this point as far as im concerned as far as everyones concerned im going out on a limb here i understand but okay so like thats so captain c fairly simple vice captain i think probably will end up putting on and maybe ill put on cole palmer that would be the other logical vc pick against everton well thats an interesting question because i do think that everton is a team where you could target their defensive assets too and i wonder if that could be to me like maybe the most likely scenario was like 11 for that match but i one nil everton win wouldnt be like a shocking result there so what about in terms of your guys your teams this week maybe well start with dave what are you you have five you have four transfers im rolling no matter what to get the five just for the bit for the banter just to see that number in the in the bus team next week are you are you are you being serious like think i have a celba problem i have a saka half problem so those wed share your team but just because weve got this like hacked setup for the todays stream im not gonna do that no i wild card a few weeks ago so i had the fairly template wild card team but no diaz which has been a good move but then the sano smith row eth attacker like rotation thing so i dont know i you could so theres might be some opportunities to fiddle around with stuff but again i dont know who is a screaming by this week as weve talked about so i think if you i think wat like lets say like you had the luxury of not needing to make any big changes this week i think watkins would be someone target well you already have him but i just in general were switching to just general sorry good speaking of a good question in the chat around spurs of theyre scoring goals but and brendan this is your pet topic of do you want someone a team to target thats scoring a lot of goals but its spread out or the concentrated of the spear of low scoring t i know you feel strongly about this but it is frustrating to have soleni and then four goal game and nothing so thats super frustrating but it seems fluky though exactly i dont know can we see itos can we see it first well hes hes done it two i know youre trying to rope me into simmons talk here but its hes hes had returns in the two previous weeks right solank so i we have been seeing him round into fantasy shape he hasnt i dont think hes had a big match right i dont think weve seen him like even thats like get like multiple attacking returns in a match so far i just think to watch him play he is its so much hold up play from him and i think like some spurs fans would suggest that an will change those tactics depending on the opponent and i think west ham would be given their vulnerability on crosses and set pieces still it didnt feel like salanki was a huge part of that plan for him to be getting the final ball still he was playing very well as a hold up player but its just im not seeing the huge fantasy ceiling for i think and i think i just pulled up his stats he had attack returns in three matches in a row before this one takes along but hes not you want the double digits so maybe sun is the possible outside play and theyre a little tricky too because you can see three matches in a row three attacking returns you before this blank and yet no bonus in any of those matches right and so that does get to the other problem of the old school back when man city were scoring four or five goals a match you needed to have kd b or aguero and if you had a like i was always tempting to get a bernardo silver type player right because theyd always one of the cheapest options in there de silva back when he was there but but often they would get one attack in return and no bonus right and so its like youre like ah is this worth 75m or whatever and so maybe we are a little bit there with salani i think the problem is i dont know like what about bernon johnson dave youre a sports supporter like mean hes hes been great hes on fire that could be a p but again its like its the price thing youre just like well hes not i dont mean to b down but like whos exciting to bring in its like hes so cheap hes almost not exciting youre like million in the bank thats not fun just psychologically but is the move i know i think thats one of the reason i didnt bring him in this week either i just couldnt get excited enough about it if br johnson was 102 wed all have him its so true isnt that funny the way that works sometimes i know its so true and i dont know palmer the still the fixtures are not great i think what ill ill give a shout out to the content creators of so hey palmers banging him in but the pictures are going to turn so is he a buy and he hasnt its been tough because fixtures create points so and hes still okay took four shots today he had a big chance in the first half i think or bigest chance it was a big chance for him i dont maybe for a lesser player thats a low percentage chance but he did a i this was always going to be a tough match for him and i think newcastle at home id be very surprised if he didnt get some attack and return in that one but you guys we gloss over watkins for a second i do think that theres there is some potential there the question is like lets say you were scared off of foden but maybe but maybe you do want to drop cipa this week ahead of the run could you maybe go i dont know how much it depends how much money you have in the bank already but a move that was like watkins to what lewis for example excuse me where we going cba to lewis big cba to lewis would free up like 5m roughly i think some somewhere in that maybe a little less than that maybe like 12m now and maybe then you could go chris wood or somebody you whatever whoever your third forward is you could upgrade to watkins and i that wouldnt be terrible but then after this week watkins has spurs away liverpool away chelsea away three in the next four after boras so hes almost like a get off i was looking at the to drop so i dont know like hes like a hold for this week but after that i dont know they have a home fixture midweek on tuesday against bolognia for the champions league certainly is that it good us some pork as well or get us in pork its theres some distance between billa pork and goodison pork but the pork pies are stronger through that entire corridor the bolognia spr try the fried bolognia sandwich certainly im holding my transfers until we see those champions league what are the fixers this week in the champions league so youve got villa hosting bologna you always get soemo it looks like thats the only premier league club thats thats playing on tuesday then on wednesday youve got man city hosting sparta praha liverpool away arby leig which may be the trickiest of them lets see im just hunting around for the arsenal champions league fure ag with you as if following champions league in america wasnt hard enough cuz all working this new is diabolical these pictures are crazy i can follow its like its its a mix of one of the most difficult fixtures you can imagine or the easiest fixer you played all season are we sure its i like thats champ arsal arsenal host shakar donet on tuesday so villa and arsenal both home on tuesday and then city at okay liverpool on wednesday so should have europa league as well right on thursday you so lets see im im man united are away at fer aach on thursday hunting around here for lets see blah right there blah go up a little bit go up a little bitar okay thank you for finding that and reading that chelsea are away in greece at panthia nakos as discussed with cole palmer hes not on their roster for hes still not on the okay no i dont think they submit a new roster until they get out of the group stage of the competition so hes free and easy hes its interesting you bring up like palmer is such a difficult player to not own right now because he is that guy but they have bad fixtures when is the right moment to get him i do feel like the newcastle fixture is good enough to just go for palmer and i am think im considering ways to downgrade celba or another player in my 11 to upgrade anthony gordon to palmer that would probably require three transfers so would not take a minus four just to get polymer in the midst of this run but i do feel like that is a great fixture for or you could down or you could downgrade salo because as we saw today his returns were totally fluky and you got lucky so thats cant i got lucky playing the variance with most the variance game with him as unsustainable like ninth place alltime premier league goal scorer what would you guys do if you had what would you guys do if you had diaz get rid of him no its i think so too off the boil and unfortunately because theres another international break coming up in november it does seem like you and i brandon werere talking about this morning ar slot does seem like a manager whos going to use the whole squad i salah is like one of those players hes like the sock hes like the hes a hes a movable he also came back early from the international break which made it even easier but i think it you as we have we are now seeing it for real right which is there are four players for five slots up front well see about jod he went off you injured solve that too but either way and cody i thought was pretty geeko i thought was irrelevant he was very quiet darwin came on and put himself about he was like mr dark arts against chelsea this weekend but i thought that liverpool benefited from that he was distracted some of the chelsea defenders so as far as slot saw it i think would be pleased with darwins performance solah could work his way behind him it seemed like when he was pushing up front was good for him and what about you brenon in terms of your transfers so i think if i look at my squad the problem players are celba with the red card and i feel like its im good going without arsenal defense right now i thought it feels like a coupon that the league gave us i was telling you this josh where when that wild card turn happened around gw six that was when riot and gabrielle was scoring his set pce goals looked unstoppable rya was getting a lots of fpl returns as well and then people moved off of cba to get those guys and that there is the double arsenal defense because we didnt wild card at that time we still had cba so now were in a position to just like for free just get off of the arsenal defense train while they go through this rough b batch of fixtures but if you have rya and gabrielle im not sure you can find a good enough reason to get rid of them so certainly not right and the thing is once they get past this trio of rough fixtures its its its a fantastic run for them right so you just have to weather the storm even if it will be a storm we dont know arsenal are good enough to certainly clean sheet in any fixture so its cba and gordon and i need to just look at more options in terms of downgrading cba does that open up something more interesting for gordon to become right because if you lets say lets say you did like the one of the cheapest options which was you took you turn cbos around 6m into maybe a little more or less into like mel leno one 43 that would open upe that would free up 17m for you its still not enough for me to turn anthony gordon into palmer its its enough for me to turn hts into ali watkins so and hts is the tertiary player on the bubble for me where even though hes had a good run hes been great for arsenal this season i think given the shape that arsenal team is in theyre not probably not going to be scoring three or four goals anytime soon although as dave said the run for watkins gets worse after game week nine its probably not its it feels like longterm probably not like thats a transfer that its hard to like net out super ahead on that if hars plays 90 in midweek and the team looks a little ragged hars might move closer to my maybe he gets turned into to watkins plan but w watkins has the same midweek week issue so ive got a lot of balls in the air here the other elephant in the room for me is wild card but that to me wild card is all about how im going to do premium asset structure and i think still optimally assuming everyones healthy it feels like holland plus saka plus palmer and i need i feel like i want a wild card in order to get that and there are too many things in motion right now its not a good doesnt feel like a good week to make that put a steak in the ground for i think i think in two weeks time when arsenals fixer run gets good that is a great time for you to wild card because you could you could go you could go to three options right and youd be itd be a good time to reset a little bit as far as my team just because ive got it pulled up here i will ill pick my team for next week 27 points thats brutal i know im telling you bud its its been a rough run start putting out some fake info to help your i know exactly so this is my squad right now for for game week nine it looks okay its its its like its an acceptable squad like if i had to do nothing i would be okay with that like if i were dave i would probably just save my transfer and have three i think there might be an opportunity here because i do have two transfers to change things around a little bit i think it feels like its last chance city for e i would like to see him do something in on in mondays match to feel confident in holding on to him i think who do palace host spurs its honestly not a bad fixture for him but so like that doesnt feel like the most urgent issue it would be great to get another man city asset and so i could look at as something as simple as cba to gardial would be would be an option in that case it probably robinson i dont know its like maybe hold one of my other transfers that might be that might be a possible move vardy i would like to drop eventually but i dont necessarily need to do that tren away to arsenal like not great but probably fine like its not something that im like again no ones keeping clean sheet so so moving like wasting a lot of money on defenders feels which i know undermines my gardial point but because its southampton theyve been so bad this season you could make an argument for that like theres the upside is there for guardal theres a chance of like a 15 point level return and thats something worth shooting for so i dont know you guys looking at my squad do anything else stand out to you as like an urgent not having saka remains a big problem but i think i can fix that in a couple weeks i dont think thats a problem right now not for the liverp not for the next couple weeks i dont necessarily want them right now so no i think to your point yet your weakest links are pretty like luxury moves so its your its your bench that might be the weakest link with g the greaves injury and the celba suspension you have no defenders to rotate or cover so but you wouldnt look to upgrade gaves serious hamstring injury hes out for a month my goodness so that could be mind games thats thats true who knows usually those things are like based on like lit like a literal comment from a manager its like a few weeks few weeks time well see them i do subscribe brandon though to the theory of if you lose a defender youre losing a maximum of two points score anyway so and maybe thats the secret benefit so the f up to five free transfers you talk about that like a mini wild card well its an interesting strategy for fixing your bench because if you want need to fix your bench and you have one or two free transfers youre limited in what you can do and you often make compromises in terms of how creative you can be if you had three or four transfers you fix your bench and do something interesting with one or two starting players so it i think you can weather a benching storm for one game i look at my like if i look at my squad right now and you look at my 11 and i just were to swap out robinson for gardial then id have a squad that i liked for game week and i know like for podcast listeners they are not looking at my squad right now but its a pretty its its ive got watkins holland vy up front momo rogers palmer e again all fine right and then e i dont know like arguable but like spurs are just like conceding goals for fun so like i it feels like thats a match where he could he could do something its almost baked into their approach right henderson but im not gna waste a transfer on a keeper and and then k is fine even robinson would be okay i just dont expect f to keep a clean sheet in that match although they did a way to forest in a similar match a few weeks ago so arent the most consistent so exactly so thats thats where i am lets lets wrap things up here with just a couple of questions shane asked about thoughts on defender strategy i think we covered that already so sam c asked about he says salah with more points than holland he says by the time this match finishes and almost three million cheaper is crazy if you think about its solid as expensive as he is its three million cheaper than holland can we swerve holland and have some extra cash to spread around of course i blame the content creator cal for not telling me sal is good that is a joke but okay so lets say after southampton regardless of what holland does is it is it time to consider moving him on or are we just rearranging deck chairs trying to like find the right premium salah is good i dont know what to say like we saw it today were just like is he go by watching that match like hes gonna get pens ass sure and assists and i dont youll take along but i dont know like clearcut im talking over you dave but ive got a interesting point to make i was looking at you your sol had no clearcut goal scoring opportunities and open play it was the pen and then he was creating chances for his teammates i still think hes hes below palmer saka and holland on the premium asset list all right i think so i think its pretty its pretty tight between all four of them again if i the other strategy that i could do this week and ill maybe ill give a little more thought would be to just keep saving transfers and stick to my guns and ultimately downgrade civa and trent and try to turn e into saka which would give me saka palmer holland and allow me to stick to my guns this idea that you just want three out of four of these premium assets so that would be one option too id have to like do a little investigating how honestly i could get rico lewis and that might be enough if i turned sba lewis trent into like a 45 that probably would be enough for me to turn as in s saka so thats another possibility too all right so final questions from al aloha lounge she says has foden done enough to prove to pep to prove to pep that he needs to start no tell no historically or like its like who knows like how do you prove youre over long co dave youve had long co for four years now you tell me im sorry i shouldnt make fight we havent seen how peps shirts look after foden has ironed them i assume this is how you prove your value to guardal its the little things like picking up the dry cleaning and like washing the dishes and that thing how good is the tea that foden is brewing there in the staff cafeteria well i slept through the game so you guys tell me how he looked but foden he didnt start for one well thats not a good sign so hes not and he and he didnt influence the game at all after coming on apart from taking a well taken corner to deliver the jon stones goal so that goes also back the holland question of okay then what city asset are we just not having city players like it just seems crazy and then whats the alternative like premium assets and theres not like super ones this week so thats where i just i just feel like keeping holland is just sensical but im open to it w we werent we podcasting like months ago about like you cant have everybody theyre all everyones so good and now were going through this like e where its like no ones quite there happ with the pictures thats it just so happens were in a transition week with fixtures too so im going to be in 28 points brandon once i once i get that robinson point subbed in there you go things are looking up for old josh landon all of a sudden vy somehow nicked a bonus point while we were talking today he has gained a bonus point how why is this happening this year all of a sudden these bonus points like josh is a good actor i see the dms open with fpl towers negotiating the first party pump and dump scheme i know with this yellow cards get punished too much in this game in my opinion theres too many punishment you want to talk about bps scoring system thats everyones favorite topic right u all right so i think end the stream all right so i think that i had one final question for you guys which was we talked a little bit about lewis we talked a little bit about gardial a little bit foden are there any other because the south enda match is a fantastic match are there any other possible fantasy assets on man city i know theyre the champions league as a factor and that but lets say that we get a predictable champions league 11 is there is there anybody i think you named plenty thats all we need okay like theres no like because like there could be defenders or is there any edge in any or any or even other defenders like im just curious is there any edge to be gain from picking someone whos off the tablein is the choice and hes not a choice youll talk yourself into getting bernardo silva or doku and these are these are paths to pain youre right all right so there we are and i think thats it i think we can wrap this up guys and thanks everyone for listening i gotta i gotta pull

17,alwayscheating,8tB8D24Vqrk,Red Card Drama &amp; Our GW9 Fantasy Premier League Preview,2024-10-21T07:32:30Z,"all right ready yep all right here we go is it like officially live we're officially live okay all right um hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast we are doing a live recording today I guess this is the first time you and I have actually done a um we've done in person before but in person with like the new setup on YouTube it's all new and different we're also not usually next to each other like this we've done like London trip side by side you're familiar with the the wedding photographer sort of a thing of like you're going to have to get close together like closer than you're comfortable doing just to make the shot yeah you were saying it's like the man of constant sorrow um oh brother brother and speaking of Brothers we're here with producer Dave I am a man there we go nice to see you all right on so we're here to talk about our terrible game week eights uh I think I'm the only one of the three of us who had moala today so I experienced some joyful emotion on Sunday yeah you ended up what eight 10 12 points all told 12 points from Mo yeah so then the the great regret is it's always in in hindsight well obviously I should have been more courageous and I should have Captain mosala instead of Holland so one thing we're going to have to talk about on this episode is yeah Holland has three blanks in a row where you know for all of the people who didn't believe the theory of no Roger new no de bruyne is really going to eat away at Holland's points potentially yeah then yeah some some people are saying it was me however it is it is uh uh Saints next week for Man City uh so we we there's no way out right for Holland owners once you think you're going to get out this Southampton pulls you back in it's though because I think um the question now is IDE you know a vacuum loading up on Man City players ahead of the Saints match would make a lot of sense but it's weirdly I still don't feel confident They're Gonna Keep Clean sheet even against saints like I feel like somehow they're gonna have one moment where they just get sloppy and and see to a goal and and and I also don't really know what midfielder I would have I mean it may be that you have to wait until the Champions League this week to see if um you know to see if uh like I was saying like if Bernard Silva doesn't start in the Champions League like he might be someone to Target uh I mean if foden doesn't start in the Champions League I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse about him starting um at the weekend yeah there are a few paths for me to get foden without at without being at the expense of like a premium mid where the whole arsenal Bournemouth match is another thing that we're going to have to unpack but celba owners now basically have a free role on a cheaper Defender uh assuming you don't want to stick with Arsenal defense and I don't think we can make a real case for that right now but that is a great place to make money to upgrade in my case Anthony Gordon to somebody like foden right but we're still waiting for foden to actually do something this season you were just reading about the covid conspiracy someone well I I don't know it's a conspiracy but someone in our app replies said that Co F recently had covid and then he's still recovering from it then he may potentially have long Co okay so I don't know well yeah so we're not we're not doctors Dave are you a doctor uh no but I play one on the podcast uh Dr Dave okay well I guess that would actually be a rational explanation we're trying to figure out what's happening with foden you're like there's something going on but it's been happening for years so has he had long Co for years maybe yeah I is he patient zero is what we need to figure out last year he was starting matches this early in the season right like his his F returns last season are actually pretty solid I think it was they have double digit goals and assists last year somewhere somewhere in that range at least I mean PFA player of the year uh it's hard to deny no we're not here to talk about foden's Talent level we're here to talk about the mystery of what's going on at Manchester City and like that performance against wolves felt in some way similar to the uh performance against Arsenal where they really had to hammer away at a good defensive performance from wolves until they finally got the Breakthrough at the very end also it felt a little bit like City playing fulam last uh two weeks ago yeah uh where the the chances that wolves got were on the counter and were pretty good chances and one of them they finished and the other they they simply didn't so it could be looking a lot worse for City right now in the table but Liverpool now one point ahead can we start talking about Liverpool as like title cont I mean not sure not like it's far-fetched to imagine that this stacked team would be title contenders but Arsenal are are just like quickly fading away from this discussion now back to the Glory Days of City versus Liverpool yeah and I think this was the match the Arsenal Bournemouth match and you know I guess we let's actually you know what let's do a little reset here I'm kind of freestyling here I enjoy your freestyling but we put together this nice running order and I think that we should uh try to stick to it so let's let's kick things off so game week eight kicks off with h the Spurs uh Spurs West Ham match on uh Saturday morning you and I go to Smithfield Hall yeah meet up with a listener that was nice yeah shout out to fpl Rock uh on Twitter Darren wonderful guy really enjoyed chatting with him he's been and seen football played all over planet Earth so it's just interesting sort of hearing uh what what he's seen and and also his FPL thoughts he run some FPL content uh out of a podcasting Cuba yeah got some Spanish uh content so that that was that was very cool so shout out to Darren thanks for coming out and the scene is always good at Smithfield Hall it's a West Ham supporters bar as well as a Manchester United bar so we walked into great sorrow and then we emerged Victorious with a very um Manchester United fans just can't understand how they got away with it I suppose right yeah yeah I mean I think that it was kind of uh right so you know the the the match on Saturday morning though was was was pretty interesting right I think uh you had a little bit of Saka drama which we could talk about more in a second but uh one option was to move Saka to Sun uh which that was kind of the only move that really would have worked out this week I guess I guess you did get a fod in assist late right but like that's not you know four points not that significant um but I think uh what was kind of the bigger news was that you had um poro blank Brennan Johnson blank and um blank in a four in a four goal Spurs match which I I feel like sort of that like it just the whole vibe this week was a real post International break like a little some shaky thought the matches today for example were really like surprisingly low quality um I thought uh I mean the Spurs uh or not the the Chelsea um Liverpool match I thought was um really foul heavy and um and the the Man City Wolves was just odd like I just felt like it was it was such a especially the second half it it was just like a real slog and we've seen a lot of that with Man City recently yeah you're looking for much more dynamism from Man City they seem to just insist that they can pass through through any low block But ultimately I think they just need more players be it greish doku svino who can just beat a man and there that just to create something in the box which makes it even more confusing as to why foden's rollout has been so slow because he is really good at operating in those tight spaces and he could certainly help Holland had precious few touches one or two moments that could have easily been goalscoring opportunity but you're left feeling like not awesome about Holland and this city team despite that victory yeah so um let's get into I mean I I think like just to go through the weekend which I think might be kind of the a cleaner cleaner you want we really want to talk you know what do we just really want to talk about Sunday and should we just keep it uh you want you want to work backwards here Brandon because we just we just saw these matches so maybe sure maybe working back maybe we just we scrapped the running order already this lovely running order that we put together this morning uh what are your FPL takeaways from Liverpool Chelsea yeah I think my takeaways are that Chelsea are not a defensive team you know there was that moment where I think that Sanchez's value was very much inflated by the pens save the 15p pointer that he got Y and then they ran into some yellow card suspensions and there was a lot of like ingame rotation with the backline from moresa against Chelsea so you were saying you feel like moresa rotates too much too much like what what that I feel like mesa's Hit Upon something with Chelsea that is certainly working in the attack uh in the attack aspect but now he just needs to find some cohesion and some continuity and he's not doing that at all and I I guess he's just kind of working with the situation that he got where he had too big a squad and he's really just trying to challenge these players to show him where that continuity was would be but um I still think it's Palmer or nobody from the attack nichas Jackson did have a pretty good goal though so I guess I guess if you have ridden out a a small drought with Nico Jackson uh suddenly you should be booed by what happened he's the CL he is the like one of those players that can be hard to evaluate in fantasy because he has like truly terrible body language like when you watch him play he looks like he's Absol miserable out there I mean he sort of in that like who who we put in there it's like uh uh MZ Ozil sort of famously was a bad body language player but who else was like I feel like we're missing some other of course oh Brandon always with the yeah what do you think Dave am I forgetting a bad bad body language player here how do you R your body language Dave um right I mean the great thing about New York is there's so much to see and do I'm think thinking about that they might be Giant song but um my body language right now it's it's hurting but uh it was good early in the week and then just as the games have gone on like you like you said these Sunday games it's really just dragging us down it has nothing to do with you going to Raves at for yeah yeah exactly yeah rolling in yeah exactly but but I I guess like to finish that point on on Chelsea the Wingers as as good as they are individually they're still trying to find like it does feel like moresa wants Netto to work and uh and Sancho did not have a great game moww is really just feast or famine with him fantasy wise uh so kind of like as much potential as there is with Chelsea yeah uh then you get to Liverpool your feelings on Liverpool so you only have Trent how are you feeling about Trent is that a good use of money for you at the moment he's honestly been fine I mean when I think about how my season's gone so far Trent's performance is is not at the top of the list by by any means I mean getting three consecutive blanks from Holland has honestly been a bigger problem for me considering I mean this week was a little bit different this week he was heavily Captain the last two weeks though he was a little bit of a differential Captain it didn't come through at all and so um you know my I have like just sort of larger problems with with man city that I'm trying to sort of figure out um I I suppose I've dodged at bolet by not having Rico Lewis like that's one of the like you know that's one of the few uh I guess that's worked out uh reasonably well but um I mean I I thought Salah had a real um like a modern Salah performance performance right where he sort of um like you know he struggles to take people on still but now he's now he's heads up looking for the past which has really unlocked another aspect of his game and you saw him trying a lot from wide to find his teammates in this match as you have through a lot of this season yeah so as I am I I've been like over the last few weeks looking for the jumping off point to move Salah to either Saka or Palmer and after this weekend uh um yeah I think I'm gonna gota keep going with Salah uh oh yeah though I mean they play Arsenal away in in gameweek N so uh but but I mean what would your I guess I mean Palmer let's see Palmer plays Newcastle next week and Newcastle are a total mess right now uh and Anthony Gordon has just been kind of he's he's turned from a cheeky differential into just kind of like weirdly killing my my weeks from his Miss pens to the the blanket home against Brighton so uh obviously that is a huge opportunity I think for Palmer against Newcastle in gameweek nine yeah yeah I think so I mean is that worth a transfer I guess that would be the question like is it worth so you have two transfers right going into game week n as do I Dave do you have did you make a transfer this week or no I have five I think do you really I think wow that's amazing so you actually got to five I've been waiting for someone to get to five transfers I think hold on let me double let me live check here right no I got four I guess sorry is that right one more week to go Dave yeah I think I I could roll I could roll wow I mean because you're doing you're like what like a 3K right now in the world something like that yeah I was counting you know no I think I saw that you and Dave are roughly exactly in the same position oh good yeah so he's doing uh equally terrible that's great seven figures yeah yeah me too sadly so I'm on 30 points right now thank you Mo I did terrible on Saturday the only thing I got was a goal from Morgan Rogers it was blanks from HS uh the minus three from celba and just just bad news all around Fulham uh didn't just didn't uh coales even though well okay I'm already moving to Saturday but just for my team yeah you are uh yeah you got like a you're all over the place right now you're ready to talk about fham I think it's because the camera is on you and you're you're feeling like a lot of pressure feeling the pressure it's like Albert Brooks in Broadcast News but 30 points with just Dean Henderson to go like 6.5 million gameweek rank moving me to around 1.6 million overall so I'll certainly be finishing on a red error for the week and I'm just waiting for the moment to kick on man I think a lot of people are feeling that way I mean I'm on 26 I have e and uh Henderson to go and so I'm I'm kind of feeling the same I was actually feeling okay uh going into this match and I you know if I'd gotten anything from Palmer or Trent um I would feel uh okay about this week but I mean I'm already looking at the I think the average score is 31 so I I'm already five under average and so it's kind of you know and and a hasn't done anything really the entire season right one one attack in return in in eight weeks so or I guess seven weeks we'll see what he does tomorrow so uh yeah but I think you know it's one of those weeks where it's it's it's like a good week to have a bad week you know as as they say there's you know it's not like there's like a massive swing or anything like that so Dave what about you like how are you looking on your points so far this weekend uh 20 something like everyone else 24 25 Watkins and Rogers we'll talk about full them I guess but uh like we said tomorrow's game is GNA be the clinch the hammer chriswood I got going e it's it's gonna be a it's gonna be an inter it's gonna be a moving a move week yeah that's true and I have Henderson so maybe Henderson I'll have you know a fantastic match oh I guess I am actually on 27 because I get I get one point Off the Bench I get um Robinson in for Greaves I thought Robin a yellow but apparently he didn't he put they put a yellow up on the screen at least on the uh us version of the broadcast and it was an errant a graphic he comes through with a clean clean one should we take a quick moment we because we're recording early on Saturday we've got some more UK listeners in the YouTube chat our friend uh FPL yellow Army also uh Sebastian front also has five free transfers so you know that's a we're on the lookout for these rare people these unicorns the are there any questions in the chat Dave you want we had a we had a an addition to the bad body language of Bruno oh Bruno yeah he's a great he's a great bad body language player for that was an interesting moment in that Manchester United match where there was an a camera angle on Bruno where I thought he had joined the uh Turkish hair transplant Brigade his hair just looked really full yeah this weekend for for some reason so but but I kind of backed away from that theory and I just feel like I need to say Bruno your hair looked really you had a great hair day on Saturday that's remember when Sal used to have the really long hair and it was just like not a great I bet it looked cool off the pitch but it was like it really didn't uh did not work on if it rained it was not a great look that hair had goals in it though that's true that hair did have goals in it that's that's a fair point yeah that's a fair point uh all right well let's so let's return back to Saturday as as you were saying it's I think the fullam Villa match it's I think my take away I mean you know Morgan Rogers scored a goal Watkins scored a goal I mean I don't think there's anything super dramatic in that I guess my my big fantasy to take away from that match would have been that R jimnez got the full 90 minutes uh took took you know scored a goal early nice goal as well and uh played uh I thought pretty well throughout I mean he really only had the one the one big chance but I think if there's been a little bit of hesitation around him just because of his injury history and stuff like that I you know this really feels like the season where're we're all kind of struggling to find that cheap third forward and maybe um maybe that doesn't really exist maybe it's Chris Wood honestly I mean you know he's he's the only consistent one I actually I want to ask Brandon about what he feels about Jimenez because I saw after the match he's the Top Value forward on Mikel to's table Holland hum men a Buy Brandon why not fulam fulam are an attacking team if nothing else right now and mun's just he he's lost his spot to ra Raul had a fantastic International break with Mexico scoring a screamer and and fulam do have good fixtures right terrific run yeah Everton brenford Palace wolves in the next four I mean that's a really really strong run I although one other takeaway from Saturday is uh two clean sheets in a row for Everton um they have wred the ship and we kind of I don't know about you guys I I just assumed this would happen eventually it was it was I mean like they had last season they had yeah they had a ton of injuries to start the season right and so we kind of um and and even now they I mean brw is still not back although he should be soon um that that's actually one of the unfortunate things is that probably uh Michael Keane who um had a great match today or Le from F perspective um he's at 4.1 million but I think you have to avoid Kean unfortunately because I do think that he had been basically dropped for br branway last last year and so I think he's a doubt but um you did have um the U Michael Kane though remains a great actor yeah Micha Michel Michael Kane uh fantastic um and when he scores points his his voice the trip the trip that was good we needed that Dave yeah but I but I mean speaking of Everton uh you know I think that for anyone who's looking like you and I like one of the things that really screwed us one of the reasons that you and I and and many others are on less than 30 is he has a CBA right and not just getting negative3 from him but the fact that anyone who had Rya got got hurt by that um sort of limited all of Arsenal's attacking you know sort potential in that match sure yeah it it hurt me having hovers and the damage was already done to Saka owners so Saka being a Miss there was just it was an interesting sort of wave waveform of content leading up up to the gameweek talking about Saka I mean Andy Martin I think probably had the cleverest thing where he actually drove down to Arsenal's hotel in Bournemouth and took a photo of himself and where they had saw the team getting off the bus to do a height comparison he's based he's based in South Africa too so that's that's incredible commitment yeah so I hope you have Diamond status Andy to afford that flight because to do that last minute is is is crazy there's a lot of sort of uh stur and Drang about about uh who knew what uh do we know anything Josh about team sheets what what do you mean do we you getting inside leaks yeah oh yeah right so okay yeah I okay I wouldn't know the first thing of how to get them to be so you yeah so you and I thought about this and so just for anyone who isn't um on Twitter and and congratulations if you aren't I mean that's that's fantastic yeah good yeah exactly and Twitter Twitter is a is a dying social media network uh that that has now been um like it's primarily FPL as far as I can tell it's like those are the people who are like hanging on and they're just everyone is absolutely furious with each other and this is like uh this been going on for like a year and a half I actually basically bowed out like unfortun I now turned Twitter into like a place where I just like share like podcast information FPL FPL Twitter is like going to a Sunday family dinner uh with your like extended relatives often it is cordial but you all know that you all secretly hate other or it's yeah it's like a it's like a family trip that go that's one day too long you know and yeah and I just think U okay the coup I have a couple of thoughts about this and so basically the the issue was that there was a lot of you know information about Saka or a lack of information about Saka really um and most of the uh people who are making FPL I don't actually like the phrase content creators I don't know why but like a lot of people who make FPL YouTube videos and podcast whatever we advocating to keep Saka and that's where we I mean you know I I I just my my rationale was basically that he always starts he always starts artetta is not one of these managers like if artetta says that he's close to starting my expectation is that he probably will start it's not like I don't think it's you know like whereas other other managers like Eddie how for example right you genuinely have no idea like if how says that ESO is we plan to have him start tomorrow that means it's like 5050 right like you you genuinely can't believe um what he says but I I think um and so there was a lot of debate about this it turned out like basically all of these people dropped um Saka um and you and I uh cool guys that we are didn't even have Saka so we were able to avoid that we had no one to drop yeah we had no one to drop so uh and Dave you had you had Saka yourself right and so you you kept him yeah I mean you're also in the club I was in I was in the you we're all family in the club yeah yeah uh no that was my thought too it's like worst case scenario he's not in Squad you'll get Sing Off the Bench at Samano for sub so it's actually that was a pretty easy solution but like we were talking about before I think it was a sound Theory because the pictures coming up are turning for Saka they you know with no odard he's looking all off so but I the also the AL Alternatives weren't super clean like it's a double transfer to Palmer or it's foden who we all we already talked about is a risk and I love foden but so son was a risk too a little bit consistent as well I mean he's got a really son sun has not been a like a super reliable fantasy asset this season sun was was clearly past fit for the weekend but I agree with you both like it was Spurs were in at least some goal scoring form without him you never know how slowly Andrew is going to want to bring him back there so there was some risk there too but that turned out to be the the best Mo I think in some ways that we're sort of a little bit on the outside of this of this world because a lot of the content that we do we're not we're not doing a lot of deadline streams right we're not like talking to people 10 minutes before partially because we don't uh we're we're still asleep when the deadline hits right it's like you know the the deadline is 6:00 a.m. East Coast time it is not I am not up at in most cases every on then if it's like if it's crucial you know I'll I'll do it but in general I'm not waking up at 5:15 to to check things I'm just I'm kind of going with it and so I think you know so we don't necessarily get like hit by this stuff as much but I think this there's an idea out there that and I guess like this this just sort of speaks I think a little bit and I I you know like forgive me if I'm going off off FPL here a little bit but like just the relationship that people have with people who create content a little bit and this idea that that like hey you were saying to me yesterday hey like no one's making like a ton of money on this there's this belief that that there's this iory Tower in which somebody who makes just go to I I implore you to go to our YouTube channel and look at the quality of of this uh we're what are you taking the camera the face actually okay yeah well okay yeah back back back up I know you're talking about us here yeah by the way I'm in Josh's house right now and uh I don't know the money seems to be rolling in here so yeah you are in a parlor so yeah but but none none nonetheless the the point is that there there is this this sort of like class structure and content creators um are a yeah like reaping this incredible revenue from it while while not doing any work like the people who do make money like from it like work their tails off and we so whatever that that would be the point can I ask you a question though about that so even putting the money aside or including the money even what's the incentive to lie right yeah does that mean you're G to watch more contribute to someone who lies to you what's the what's the game theory of this I'm not understanding there's some Edge in duding three or 400 people or whatever right about about what you're doing it's like there's there's 12 million people or whatever 11 million people playing fantasy like the the amount of people that you would gain an edge on is so small right and well yeah you're not making money by playing FPL because that' be against the rules right yeah well there's that too yeah so I don't understand like what even is the argument of why but I think that's the sub I think that's the subex the subtext of people getting mad about this stuff is that um that they are doing it to get an edge over over the opposition right I think that that that to me is what people are mad about this idea that there's like that they have secret knowledge they're not sharing in order to like I suppose get more Rank and I think you're rightly making the case and again we don't need to like belabor this because even so like Andy said he might um change it two days before I watched a video so I I don't see where people get this and just this idea that like that people have I actually don't think there's that much see I mean I'm in plenty of like DM threads with like these exact people and a lot of them like I believe me like a lot of them are talking minutes before the deadline trying to like Cas me about asking everybody else if they know anything right it's not like it's not like there's like the secret feed and we know the cheaters are pro leaks you guys will share any leaks that no one's ever done it though you know it's a you know the problem is our our listener Base Pro right there proof we're breaking conspiracies here live I think it's it's ultimately to our benefit that our listener base is not really a Twitter base and so it's so funny like I think of my friends no and Louise who are producers of the Pod and every now and then I'll talk to them and they they're just they do not pay attention to any of this kind of stuff and they think like it's insane that anybody does you know and I'm like that's probably like even though they manage a fantasy team the joy they derive is uh is is watching the matches of the weekend and exactly and they have a mini League of Their Own and I I we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and that a lot of the anger that people have about fantasy stems from really caring about overall rank yeah right and I think that this is just something I think like maybe this like has to be like a theme for us this year which is like invest in your mini leagues invest in head-to-head leagues invest in stuff that you can do with smaller groups of people where you have a better chance of winning because if your goal is to finish in the top 10,000 out of 11 million people your odds are about as good as as you know it's like it's not like winning the lottery but it's about like you know not as good as Arsenal winning the the league you should say yeah exactly you're talking about investing time I'd say they're lower than that you know yeah talking about time investment right yeah time in yeah all of it you know yeah so it's just like it's it's just not really um I I just think like there's I think our goals should be focused on um and like find like find like again like yes watch the matches enjoy them find moments of joy in that of course um but I think just like looking purely from a fantasy point of you if you're if you're only thinking about overall rank it's probably a quick way to um just spend a lot of week and I I feel guilty of this too spent a lot of time getting really frustrated right like if I asked you like right now I am feeling frustrated with my season right I'm like in the millions like like Davis and I you're not that far into the hundreds thousands I at 1.6 million are yeah exactly so like we're all you know like a a rough season and and but if I look at like and I actually have to force myself to do this right but if I looked at our mini leagues even like the ones that are like more competitive where I really would like to win I maybe 30 points back 35 like it's nothing right there's you know 30 weeks to go in the season like it's so long plus the mystery chip that's gonna change everything exactly maybe the mystery chip will just be like you click the button and you get the leaks yeah you get the leaks or it's like or it's like a lottery and it's like you just hit a button you get like someone gets an extra 100 point someone get an extra you know 200 like who knows what's GNA happen the mystery chip yes well so that's that's really what's going on that's an update on what's going on in the FPL Twitter yeah space speaking of conspiracies though do we need to go back to Arsenal and talk about further red card drama for them what what did you make of the civa red card and like Dean rice saying to the officials after the match it happens to us every week well I that's just like that's a self every manager is full of self-pity and and and you know and has there a lot of um like you mean like listen like it's it I to me it's actually and everyone's everyone who is like provar is gonna hate this but to me it's like it's another V problem which is basically that it it Force like there's no once you look at V there's no way not to call that a red card right because it is by every technical rule like like an off like it's it's he's the last man yeah he's the last Defender and so you have to do but the referee on the pitch called it a yellow and that from a from like an enjoyment standpoint and ultimately kind of from a fantasy standpoint too um depending on how many Arsenal assets you had I guess it's like it's the it's it like it made it made for a worse match right and so it's like that that is what's frustrating to me and I just think that VR I mean I don't know I guess the exact same play happened today against with Liverpool Chelsea where tosen took Joe to down within the first 10 minutes of the match thankfully they didn't carbon cop and Oliver in the VAR boo decided to stick with the yellow card instantly too which I think was smart it was like four I don't think you arrive was like 4 seconds in he was like nope this we're just not gonna call this right so you know you you do feel for Arsenal getting hit with all these sort of like minor infractions that lead to red cards but I fluky it is fluky and I have this theory that I think artetta you know and anyone who's watched the All or Nothing Amazon documentary about uh Etta's season with that season with Arsenal where artetta is just kind of a guy who really enjoys putting out these like big brain you know NBA theories about how to play football and how to be tactical and I think his weirdness is now in the heads of all of these Arsenal players so they're like overthinking all of these instances on the pitch and trying to gain an edge like artetta tries to gain an edge in the press conference room of like lying about players injury status and then he's got his players on the pitch kind of doing weird similar types of things but with trying to like walk that red card line or delaying the game and all that stuff I think it's I just think it's really fluky honestly and I think um I mean if you look at all the all the situations um it's you had a time wasting right that's that's isn't that basically what um got um trer knocked out of the match in the man city right it's like time wasting yeah and um you had uh the dean rice I actually don't think should have been a red card I mean it was obviously a second yellow and a red but like I thought that one was like another was that was that is that time wasting too so same exact same thing that trer did yeah so um yeah so two time wastings and then and then a kind of technically accurate red card so I I think that is all just like fluky stuff that'll that that will will get kind of wiped away but I am sort of curious about the the clean sheet part of it and the sort of and I think there is like a like an actual FPL angle to this and and whether we think I mean my feeling is basically this and you guys tell me if you disagree um you had a lot of um a lot of international tournaments this summer right and so a lot of players came back late um a lot of top players especially Defenders you know Center like a bunch of center backs uh top clubs were playing not Ben White as we all know but many others uh of course now he's a right back mostly um but I think that you um so they didn't necessarily have enough time to practice together and I think that uh I think there so a little bit of that a little bit of there's so much money in the Premier League now that even Bournemouth level clubs can get like aelon type players right like you just like you can like basically bring in like really talented Brazilians to be your forward even if you're like the 15th best team in the Premier League imagine shakiri at Stoke City it's it's yeah that sort of and so I think that that's part of it too it's just like it's I don't think you get like in um La Liga you know or or the Bundesliga like this level of of talent like at the in the bottom you know third of the of the league and so I think that that affects clean sheets maybe like more increasingly but I but I do think um ultimately long term that we will get there again and and maybe this is just something that we just really need to like think about going forward which is just don't Focus don't invest too much money in your defense the first half of the season and the second half of the season is when you can start to kind of turn the dial a little bit because I feel like we see this every single year with man city which is that they have this kind of run where they can see a bunch of goals and then the final 10 weeks of the Season no one can score on them right it is like they they one nil their way to a title and I just don't I just think we're gonna see that again this year um yeah what do you guys think yeah Dave Man City I mean that there they're a punchline defensively at least in fantasy terms how how how close are you as of today in considering a city Defender for the run you brought this up and I just mely said like you you know like I just I've gone through the ederson ringer we've all had yeah like like Josh you said Rico Lewis I mean he is he's probably a buy still because he's starting every match I guess so I mean he and he does get forward a little bit too will be the bandwagon during this transfer window because the Run continues for city is he scored his second goal of the season and he finished last season so strong that people will remember that so I think CBA to guardal is probably the algorithmic preference for going into gameweek nine that's interesting that actually makes a lot of sense I'm surprised I haven't really thought about that more seriously that that's a pretty logical move I know but like you just said that long um point you made I think was good though it's like why would we have that undermine the point I just yeah it actually makes a lot of sense I mean uh yeah can I spend more money on my defense ignore everything I just said yeah and plus Trent like if we have him and Gabriel sure yeah that's why Ric loose might feel more tempting because you can use that money so what is yeah how do you measure the upside of guardal it really is it's the same with Trent where you're just kind of talking about the high ceilings but it has been so variable the Returns on Defenders that I you know I'm sure an equally compelling case could be made to just getting all 4.5s well let's well there's not that many good can you bring up the FPL Hub heat map for guardal yeah yeah exactly I let me see if I can pull that up in real time yeah without things getting too chaotic here but I am I am okay so let's let's say that like we we like that we actually believe what I've just said which is that you want to um maybe scale back a little bit on your defense and I I feel this way a little bit about Trent where I do wonder if that money could be spent um invested and a and you know like a better third forward perhaps I have Jamie vardy at the moment like that can't last I'm Gonna Keep I'm Gonna Keep Jamie vardy Ponzi scheme is yeah I know yeah exactly I did finally get a goal this week thankfully B pump and dump over here yeah exactly that goal yeah exactly if we all get B it's better for Josh yeah if this If This Were draft League then I'd be' be even better I'd be trying to you switch him off but um yeah so he's got to go eventually and maybe there's like a you know I don't know like maybe I I can find someone else it could just be I go back to Chris Wood but let's say that I want to um start taking some money on my defense and put it in my Midfield and and forward lines um and I think you know and maybe the other the other way would be that we've talked before about how you just want to try to have three out of four of these like expensive premium assets and that just may be the thing that you need to do and that you're going to kind of always get something and I think we saw that this week right like um obviously in play but and I guess when I say four I'm thinking Saka Holland uh Palmer and Salah right those are like the big kind of four the big four fantasy assets this season I think and uh it seems like every single week you're gonna get like one of those will carry you if you have them um now obviously you could have had Holland um Holland Saka and um Palmer and Palmer this week and that would have been three blanks but I think without Saka playing I think if Saka had played that's a totally different story I'm going to ask you a hypothetic here Josh Dave I want to hear your opinion too imagine Holland blanks against Southampton at home at the Edie hot you laugh and you think like how improbable it is right but it'll be four blanks in a row and in those blanks you have some weak opposition you look at the injuries surrounding the club how close would you be to dropping Holland uh if he were to blank against Southampton I mean is that a conversation you to even entertain it wouldn't be at the top of my priority list still I'm going to make a decision off one week but also we had a question on the YouTube of are you is this hurting the coland triple Captain shout against how I think I think it is talking about dumping him people are talking about triple captaining him like very much hurts it I don't know I don't know how you can triple Captain him at the moment I mean yeah like I think he'll score this this next weekend but if there was a uh say like foden uh and I'm sorry uh well say foden and de bruyne returns from his injury midweek in the Champions League and there was that dramatic a shift and how you expected Man City to line up against Southampton potentially but yes as it is given the state of play I I just cannot of fathom triple captaining Holland right now what do you think Dave I don't know maybe dibling in you know if they could do yeah yeah give it to dibling for the end of the season I'm thinking the other side the Galaxy brand they keep making goals you know yeah yeah that's true dibling 4.5 right yeah I'm just I'm a you know like you Josh I enjoy by the way on the on the patreon pods you go through some of the odds of the anytime goal scorers I think right I'm I'll be honest I'm a slave to those odds because like you know those are efficient markets usually and just Holland's just always very good odds to do something so I I don't see myself dropping them it is like they have to it feels like pep will figure this out it's a little bit like um uh like we're talking about D and Everton uh earlier it's like this idea that things aren't working and they're not feeding the ball to Holland is like a problem that can't be fixed is is I think wrong right like in gandan and Berard Silva and Phil foden whenever he gets over his long covid you know in the years to come I don't know I who know I'm not I'm not actually planting that in the world that was just what somebody said in one of our replies but you know I think that you have um like eventually they're going to figure maybe Jack relish needs to get back in there like they need like somebody who's like a better Creator right I'm not sure doku is as good of a is greish on on the left and so I think that you know they're and obviously they're missing rodry but I I just I I I do think that pep is is is the Premier League's best manager and I think that he'll eventually and I mean eventually like as in like 20 weeks I think like by by by this weekend possibly he's going to uh figure it out um but to go back to my question about um defense let's say we we wanted to take the money out uh looking at these fixtures like the next seven this actually I I almost never looked seven fixtures ahead by the way I think um five or six is as far as I ever want to look um this because too many things change to people get injured but um are there a couple of teams that you would recommend somebody targeted if they were looking to drop celba or if they were looking to um clear up money to bring in let's say Saka gets a clean bill of health and I mean it's actually a terrible week to bring in Saka but like you know let's say let's say you want to bring in Palmer you know and you want to keep Saka while you're doing it yeah who would be some sheep Defenders that you might look at I like still like naam Forest uh great stats I am haunted by that assist that Ana had against Liverpool to Hudson ooi uh earlier this season I think and they have at least two good fixtures coming up with they're haunted like because you wanted to I'm haunted just in like I think about it all the time I'm not haunted like it really affected my life it's like it's like a 19th century like English novel spooky season uh I am doing a lot of opium though to go with the maybe that something to do with how I seea everywhere but I do but they have Lester away and then wam at home and West Ham just the the implosion continues and even Newcastle at home you have to like for Forest so I think you mentioned Everton before and Everton have this sort of Newfound defensive form I'm curious about these fixtures though for Everton Fulham even though they're hosting Fulham are an attacking team very capable of scoring we talked about the run that Raul is on and then probably the two best defensive fixtures for Everton are away from home with Southampton and West Ham and then they finish off this mini run of theirs with brenford uh at hosting at goodison Park who is also a pretty Adept Fork I wonder if that's a little stand that they have outside the stadium how could it not be how could the best uh the best sausages this side of the you know the TS or something like this um which I know it is does not run as far north as that but uh so if I'm comparing Everton and Forest that's my little like te AET there yeah I'm I'm going Forest yeah I was making a tiny shout for um udogie um as a kind of Cheaper route into the Spurs defense um but you know the problem right now is uh you're not getting clean sheets anywhere right and so you ideally this one of the reasons I'm not like dying to get rid of Trent because I'm like well at least he has different like multiple routes to points right like sometimes I'll look into a clean sheet and sometimes I'll I'll get an attack in return uh but aogi has actually been like a reasonably attacking asset for um for Spurs and so he might be somebody I mean obviously poro is still the kind of top poro has set pieces over Udi he's more consistent defensively he does shoot more he had a really great opportunity off of corner kick this on on Saturday and some would argue that vanen is is roughly the same price says Udi and maybe he's a little bit more con consistent I don't know Udi's had a very strange season he's had moments where he's been very defensively inept but that's just like a read outside of the fantasy game it's just all about returns and I do see what you're seeing Josh where he is actually getting into the box a bit more when they're pushing down that left hand side of the pitch I guess it's just that he's 4.9 million right so he's he's pretty cheap like you could you could move um and they have like a you know pretty decent run of fixtures um uh Palace Villa uh I mean Villa's a tough fixture obviously but then if switch and fulam at home two the three after that so um you know I don't what do you think Dave about the Spurs defense in general I mean obviously it's been a source of some frustration the last few weeks yeah I think I think parro's the obvious move if you're gonna do a civa replacement yeah so but it's not I'm not you know super excited and yeah I to consult the heat maps on new doggy yeah I don't have a heat map here but I mean heat map over here por por you know 5.5 million is poro so he's point6 more than um than ad dogy but he does have you know it's five blanks in six for poro as well which is kind of a lot for like a to me it's like if I'm if I'm GNA a Defender that costs more than five million I really want some I I really I want to be averaging some kind of return whether it's clean sh attack return like basically every other match right because it's quite a lot of money when you can sort of fluke your way into clean sheets of any old 4.5 million well that's what I'm saying is it even worth at that point because then just go the clean sheets with like forest or Brighton or anyone di yeah and a dogies just got the one assist so far in the season you're not gonna get a return from a Defender every other game it seems like at the moment so yeah exactly maybe maybe Trent gets you the closest yeah yellow Army makes a good point on the chat it was Anthony Elena uh who actually got that assist well so I'm still haunted by Ana uh I'm trying to figure out why Spectre can't you can't make out the shapes you know it's it's like a smoke Smokey you know Vision it could be Grandma it could be Grandma I'm not sure Grandma that's I think that's the title for today's podcast actually it could be grandma and other thoughts on game week nine um all right well let's um anything else that you want to discuss we can we can move on actually and talk about game week n in a second here but any other kind of final thoughts on um on the matches that we saw over the weekend I think we probably covered everything I guess the one you know Newcastle um that is the one where I just it's surprising to me they've had a number of good fixtures and just feels like um the The Vibes are off mag yeah we need a Vibe shift uh with with Newcastle sometime soon it it is all it all stems we thought that all of uh newcastle's good fortune and good form stemmed from jool Linton it turned out it was Kieran trippier the whole time yeah and as he has faded from the team so has has has the form so all right I think it's over for let's let's move on let's talk about game mc99 just quickly before we do I want to give a quick shout out to everyone who Sports the podcast on patreon

podcast and even at the lowest pledge level you get access to the Discord and so that's just a nice way to maybe um uh you know get some access to some new fantasy um content and then U we're also we're gonna start a contest sometime soon I think we talking about maybe doing it before the second half this time around just because I know some people are getting a little frustrated with their overall ranks and it might be a chance to uh get to juice things up maybe we'll do it like after the next um juice juice yeah we have thankfully you I know you guys are sick of the Premier League already we got another National break coming up in a couple of weeks and so it might be a time to um to to kick off one weekend of Premier League was plenty get me out of here I know exactly already gearing up for the next IB so uh we should do like an off the side FPL Challenge League or something it's like you guys like I I don't even know what FPL challenge is and you were explaining to me I was like actually sounds kind of fun and if it's a daily fantasy there's always you don't have to worry about your current team so maybe can do like a second half like League or something with that it's a little it's a little bit like D and D where it's like you need someone to be like the like I just mean like you need someone to like actually be the kind of like um what are they dungeon master dungeon master yeah you just need someone to be um that was the word I thought it was then I was like I doubted myself at the last second but you basically need somebody to Safe politically to say dungeon master yeah exactly I'm not gonna get cancel for saying dungeon master uh no but it's um it's a you know it's like you need someone to who's like enthusiastic who kind of leads the chart right and actually this goes back to the mini thing we talking about before too this is kind of like patreon stuff aside but um if you you know if you're not if the person who leads your mini league isn't like actively managing it or like engaging it maybe you need to be that person you know it's like uh it's like be the you know be the change exactly thank you Obama thanks Obama you know all right well let's move on then um I want to look ahead to to gameweek nine um I think the captaincy we have a couple of questions too but just just to kind of kick things off um captaincy I think is is relatively straightforward this week right I I I think uh it's going to be I very hard for me to Vision not going with early Holland even with those blanks but if Holland were to get injured or if there was some risk of him starting right there's some leak that comes out that he's not um expected to start this match or something like that um then I think um you could you could consider um uh and bomo uh right I think hosting nip switch could be one yeah Ando blanked this week for the first time in quite a while and just imagine having an asset where it's surprising when they blank and his name is not earling Holland right uh it was it was surprising kind of to see on bomo blank this week and he has a plum home fixture uh apologies to our buddy James Holland but ipswitch just have not got going this season at all and for all the talk about how well managed they are and and how they they're they're sort of like canny enough to play in the Premier League they are a team to Target at this point yeah as far as I'm concerned at as far as everyone's concerned yeah I'm going out on a limb here I understand but um okay so like that's so Captain C fairly simple Vice Captain I think I actually probably will end up putting on EMB maybe I'll put on Co Palmer I mean that would be the other um kind of logical VC pick Herz against Everton well that's an interesting question actually because I do think that Everton is a team where you could Target their defensive assets too and I I wonder if that could be um I mean to me guess like maybe the most likely scenario was like 1-1 for that match but I I one nil Everton win wouldn't be like a shocking result there um so what about um in terms of you guys um your teams this week maybe we'll start with Dave what are you um you have five you have four transfers yeah I'm rolling no matter what to get the five just for the bit just just for the banter for the just to see that number in the in the bus team next week are you are you actually are you being serious like guess think I mean I mean I have a CRA problem because of a s a half problem yeah so we we'd share your team but we just because we've got this kind of like hacked setup for the today's stream I'm not gonna do I mean no I I Wild Card a few weeks ago so I had to fairly template wild card team but no Diaz which has been a good move but then of you know the Sano Smith row eighth attacker kind of like trick rotation thing so I don't know I you could so there's might be some opportunities to um fiddle around with stuff but again I don't know who is a screaming B this week as we've talked about so I think if you um I think uh what let's say like you had the luxury of not really needed to make any big changes this week um I think uh Watkins uh would be someone you could Target yeah well you already have them but I just just in general yeah sing to just general yeah sorry actually a good actually speaking of a good question in the chat around Spurs of you know there scoring goals but and Brandon this is your pet pet topic of do you want someone a team team to Target that's scoring a lot of goals but it's spread out or the concentrated tip of the Spear of low scoring I know you feel strongly about this but it is frustrating to have senen and then four goal game and nothing um so that's super frustrating but it seems kind of fluky though too right exactly so I don't know if can we see it Josh can we see it first he's he's done a two ex I know you're trying to rope me into Simmons talk here uh but it's uh I he's he's had returns in the two previous weeks right sank so I we we have been seeing him kind of round into fantasy shape he hasn't I don't think he's had a big match right I don't think we've seen him like even necessarily get like multiple attack and returns in a match so far I think to watch him play he is it's so much Hold Up play from him and uh I think like some spurs fans would suggest that an will change those tactics depending on the opponent and I think West Ham would be you know given their vulnerability on crosses and set pieces still it didn't feel like salanki was a huge part of that plan for him to be getting the final ball still he was playing very well as a hold up player but it's just I'm not seeing the the the huge fantasy ceiling for I think and actually I think and I just pulled up his stats he actually had attacks in three matches in a row before this one takes long but he not you want the double digits so maybe sun sun is a possible outside play and they're a little tricky too because you can see uh three matches in a row three attacking returns you before this blank uh and yet uh no bonus in any of those matches right and so that does get to the other problem of the the kind of old school back when man city were scoring four or five goals a match you kind of needed to have KD b or you know Aguero and if you had a like it was always tempting to get a Bernardo Silva type player right because they'd always be the one of the cheapest options in their D Silva I suppose back when he was there you know but um but often they would get one attack in return and no bonus right and so it's like you're like ah is this worth 7.5 million or whatever and so maybe maybe we are a little bit there with salanki I think the problem is um I don't know I mean like what about Brenan Johnson Dave I mean you're a sore supporter like I mean he's been he's been great yeah he's on fire that could be a p but again it's like it's the price thing you're just like well he's not I don't mean to B down but like who's exciting to bring in it's like he's so cheap he's almost not exciting you're like I have 5 million in the bank that's not fun just psychologically the moves I know I think that's one of the reason I didn't bring him in this week either I just couldn't get excited enough about it you know if BR Johnson was 10 points too we'd all have them yeah yeah it's so true isn't that funny the way that works sometimes I know it's so true and and I don't know Palmer the still the fixtures are not great I think what I'll I'll give a shout out to the content creators of so you know hey Palmer's banging them in but the pictures are GNA turn so is he really a buy and he hasn't been tough because pictures create points so yeah I mean and he's still okay took four shots today uh he had a big chance in the first half I think uh or biggish chance I mean it was a big chance for him I don't you know maybe for a lesser player that's a low percentage chance but he did a uh I you know this was always going to be a really tough match for him um and uh I think Newcastle at home I'd actually be very surprised if he didn't get some kind of attack in return in that one but you guys sort of um we we gloss over uh Watkins for a second I mean I do think that there's there is some potential there the question is I guess like let's say you were scared off of foden uh but maybe you know but maybe you do want to drop cipa this week ahead of the Run could you maybe go um I don't know how much it depends how much money you have in the bank already but a move that was like Watkins to um uh you know uh what yeah Lewis for example excuse me let start where we going SBA CBA to Lewis that's a big yeah s but Lewis would free up like you know 1.5 million roughly I think some somewhere in that maybe a little less than that actually maybe like 1.2 million now uh and maybe then you could go Chris Wood or somebody you whatever whoever your third forward is you could upgrade to Watkins and I that wouldn't be terrible I mean but then after this week Watkins has Spurs away Liverpool away Chelsea away three in the next four Bor so he's almost like a get off I was actually looking at the drop so I don't know he's like a hold for this week but after that I don't know yeah Villa have a home fixture midweek on Tuesday against bolognia for the Champions League certainly uh that it good us some pork as well or get us in pork yeah yeah it's there's some distance pork and and goodis and pork uh but the the pork pies are stronger through that entire Corridor the bolog yeah try the fried bolognia sandwich um certainly I'm holding my transfers until we see those those Champions League yeah what are what are the fixtures this week in the Champions League so yeah you've got Villa hosting uh bologna you always get so emotion yeah it looks like that's the only Premier League club that's that's playing on Tuesday then on Wednesday you've got Man City hosting Sparta praha Liverpool away Arby leig which may be the the trickiest of them let's see I'm just hunting around for the Arsenal Champions League fixture as if following Champions League in America wasn't hard enough CU well working this new structure is diabolical these pictures are crazy I can follow it it's like it's it's a mix of one of the most difficult fixers you can imagine or the easiest fixer you played all season yeah like are we sure it's that's arsal Arsenal hosts uh shakar donet on Tuesday so Villa and Arsenal uh both home on Tuesday and uh then City at uh okay Liverpool on on Wednesday so should have Europa League as well right on on Thursday yeah you yeah so let's see I'm I'm really yeah man man united uh are away at fer aach on Thursday hunting around here for uh let's see blah blah blah blah right there blah blah blah go up a little bit go up a little bit okay yeah thank you for finding that and reading that uh Chelsea are away in gree at pananos but you know as as discussed with Cole Palmer he's not even on their roster for oh he's still not on that okay no I don't think they submit a new roster until they get out of the group stage okay uh of the competition so he's free and easy I mean he's it's interesting you bring up like Palmer is such a difficult player to not own right now because he he is that guy but they have bad fixtures when is the right moment to get him I do feel like the Newcastle fixture is good enough to just go for Palmer and I am think I'm considering ways to downgrade celba or another player in my 11 to upgrade Anthony Gordon to Palmer that would probably require actually three transfers so would not take a minus four just to get polymer in the midst of this run but I do feel like that is a great fixture you down are you could downgrade Salo because as we saw today his returns are totally fluky and you got lucky so yeah that's true I got lucky playing the variance with most the variance game with with him as he moves yeah Ninth Place in alltime Premier League goal scorer why would you guys do if you had what would you guys do if you had Diaz get rid of him yeah no it's I think so too the boil yeah and unfortunately because there's another um International break coming up in November uh it does seem like you and I Brandon were talking about this morning arot does seem like a manager who's going to use the whole Squad I Salah is like one of those players he's like the so you know he's like the he's a he's a mov he also came back early from the international break which made it even easier uh but I think um it basically as we have we are now seeing it for real right which is there are four players for five slots in front we'll see about jod he went off you know injured yeah that yeah yeah but either way and Cody thought was pretty um geeko I thought was kind of irrelevant he was very quiet Darwin came on and put himself about he was like Mr dark arts against Chelsea this weekend but I thought that Liverpool benefited from that he was kind of distracted some of the Chelsea Defenders so as far as slot saw it I think he would be pleased with Darwin's performance yeah yeah Sol could work his way behind him it seemed like when he was pushing up front was good and what about you Brandon in terms of your transfers yeah so I think if I look at my squad the the problem players are celba with the red card and I feel like it's I'm good going without Arsenal defense right now I thought it it feels like a coupon that the league gave us I was telling you this Josh where when that wild card turn happened around gameweek six that was when Rya and Gabrielle Gabrielle was scoring his set piece goals looked Unstoppable Rya was getting a lots of FPL returns as well and then people moved off of CBA to get those guys and that there is the double Arsenal defense because we didn't wild card at that time we still had CBA so now we're in a position to just like for free basically just get off of the Arsenal defense train while they go through this rough B batch of fixtures but if you have Rya and Gabrielle I'm not sure you can find a good enough reason to get rid of them so yeah not certainly not right and the thing is once they get past this Trio of rough fixtures it's it's it's a fantastic run uh for them right right right so you kind of just have to weather the storm even if it will storm we don't know Arsenal are good enough to to certainly clean sheet in any any fixture so it's really CBA and Gordon and I need to just look at more options in terms of downgrading celba does that open up something more interesting for Gordon to become right because if you let's say let's say you did like the one of the cheapest options which was you took you turn cbos around six million into um maybe a little more or less into um like mikeno one 4.3 uh that would open up fre that would free up 1.7 million for you yeah it's still not enough for me to turn Anthony Gordon into Palmer sure yeah I mean it's it's enough for me to turn HTS into Ali Watkins so and HTS I guess is the tertiary player on the bubble for me where even though he's had a good run he's been great for Arsenal this season I think uh given the shape the Arsenal team is in they're not probably not going to be scoring three or four goals anytime soon although as as Dave said the the Run for Watkins gets worse after game week nine probably not it's it feels like long term probably not like that that's a transfer that it's hard to like net out super ahead on that you know if if if Howards plays 90 in midweek and and the team looks a little ragged Harts might move closer to my uh maybe he gets turned into Watkins plan um but W Watkins has the same midweek week issue so I've got a lot of sort of balls in the air here the other sort of ele in the room for me is wild card but that to me wild card is all about how I'm going to do premium asset structure and I think still optimally assuming everyone's healthy it feels like Holland plus Saka plus Palmer and I need I feel like I want a wild card in order to get that and there are too many things in motion right now yeah it's not doesn't feel like a good week to make that put a steak in the ground I I think I think in in two weeks time when Arsenal's fixer run gets really good that is a great time for you to wild card because you you could go you could go to three options right and you'd be sort of it'd be a good time to reset a little bit uh as far as my team um just because I've got it pulled up here I will uh I'll pick my team for next week um 27 points that's brutal yeah I know I'm telling you bud it's it's been a rough run okay you just start putting out some fake info to help your I know exactly yeah so this is my my squad right now for uh for gameweek nine it looks okay um you know it's it's it's like it's an acceptable Squad like if I had to uh do nothing I would actually be okay with that uh like if I were Dave I would probably just save my transfer and have three uh but you know I think there might be an opportunity here because I do have two transfers to change things around a little bit I think it really feels like it's kind of last chance um city for for E I would really like to see him do something uh in on in Monday's match to to feel confident uh in holding on to him I mean I think uh yeah I mean who do um Palace Palace host Spurs I mean it's honestly not a bad fixture for him but uh so like that that doesn't feel like the most urgent uh issue uh it would be great to get another man city asset and so um I could look at as something as simple as CBA vardal would be would be an option um I guess in that case it probably bench Robinson I don't know you know it's like and maybe hold one of my other transfers that might be that might be a possible move um vardy I would like to drop eventually but I don't necessarily need to do that I mean away to Arsenal like not great but probably fine like it's not something that I'm like again no one's keeping clean sheets so uh so moving like wasting a lot of money on Defenders feels which I know kind of undermines my gardial point but because it's Southampton they've been so bad this season you could make an argument for that like there's the upside is there for gardial there's a chance of like a 15o level return um and that's something worth worth shooting for so I mean I don't know you guys looking at my squad do anything else stand out to you as like an urgent not having Saka remains a big problem but I think I can fix that in a couple weeks I don't think that's a problem right now yeah not for the liver not for the next couple weeks I I don't want necessarily want them right now so yeah yeah I think to your point yet your weakest links are pretty like luxury moves so it's your it's your bench uh that might be the weakest link with G the Greaves injury and the celba suspension you have no Defenders to rotate or cover so but but uh you know you wouldn't look to upgrade Greaves to to Serious hamstring injury out for a month my goodness yeah that could be Mind Games yeah yeah that's that's true who knows yeah yeah usually those things are like based on like lit like a literal comment from a manager it's like oh a few weeks few weeks time we'll see them I do subscribe Brandon though to the theory of if if you lose a Defender you're losing a maximum of two points none of them score anyways so yeah and maybe that's the the the secret benefit so the the F up to five free transfers you talk about that like a mini wild card well it's actually an interesting strategy for fixing your bench because if you want need to fix your bench and you have one or two free transfers you're kind of limited in what you can do and you often make compromises in terms of how creative you can be if you had three or four transfers you really fix your bench and do something interesting with one or two starting players so it you know I think you can weather weather a benching storm yeah for I look at my yeah like if I look at my squad right now and you you sort of look at my 11 and I just were to swap out Robinson for um vardal then I'd have a squad that I really liked for for gameweek and I I know like for podcast listeners they are not looking at my squad right now but it's a pretty it's it's you know I've got Watkins Holland bardy up front uh Momo Rogers Palmer e again all fine right and then uh I mean as a I don't know like arguable but like I mean Spurs are just like conceding goals for fun so like you know it feels like that that's a match where he could he could do something uh it's almost baked into their their approach right but I'm not going to waste a transfer on on a keeper and um and then you know con is fine I mean even Robinson would be okay um I just don't really uh expect F to keep a clean sheet in that match although they did a way to Forest in a kind of similar match a few weeks ago so yeah not the most consistent so yeah yeah exactly so that's that's where I am um let's let's wrap things up here with just a couple of questions um you know Shane asked about thoughts on Defender strategy I think we covered that already so um Sam C asked about um says solid with more points than Holland um he says by the time this match finishes and almost three million cheaper is kind of crazy if you think about it it's all it's solid as expensive as he is it's three million cheaper than Holland um can we swerve Holland and have some extra cash to spread around of course I blame the content creator Calver not telling me sa is good yeah that is a joke um yeah but um okay so let's say after Southampton kind of regardless of what Holland does is it is it time to to consider moving him on or are we just rearranging deck chairs trying find the right premium yeah I mean is good I don't know what to say I mean like we saw it today we're just like he really go by watching that match like he's gonna get pens sure and assists and I don't you'll take along but I don't know like he had no clearcut I'm talking over you Dave here but I've got a really interesting point to make I was looking at you sol had no clearcut uh goal scoring opportunities and open play it was the pen and then he was creating chances for his teammates I still think he's he's below Palmer Saka and Holland on the premium asset list all right um yeah I I I I think so I think it's pretty it's pretty tight between all four of them again if I the other strategy that I could do this week and I'll maybe give a little more thought would be to just keep saving transfers and stick to my guns and ultimately downgrade celba and Trent and try to turn e into Saka which would give me Saka Palmer Holland and and allow me to kind of stick to my gun idea that you just want three out of four of these premium assets um so that would be one option too I'd have to like do a little um investigating how honestly I could actually get Rico Lewis and that that might be enough uh if I turned celba into Lewis Trent into like a 4.5 that probably would be enough for me to turn a into Saka so that's another possibility too um all right so final questions from Al Aloha Lounge she says uh has foden done enough to prove to pep pep to prove to pep that he needs to start no tell no I mean I mean historically or like it's like who knows I mean like uh how do you prove you're over long Co Dave you you've had long covered for four years now you tell me I'm sorry I shouldn't make we haven't seen how Pep's shirts look after foden has ironed them I assume this is how you prove your value to guardal it's the little things like picking up the dry cleaning and and sort of like washing the dishes and that sort of thing how good is the tea that foden is brewing that in the staff cafeteria I I slept through the game so you guys tell me how he looked but um foden I mean they did start for one yeah well that's not a good sign yeah so he's not yeah yeah and he and he didn't influence the game at all after coming on apart from taking a well taken Corner uh to deliver the Jon Stones goal so but that goes also back to the Holland question of okay then what city asset are we just not having City players like it just seems crazy and then what the alternative like premium assets and there's not like super ones this week so that's why I just I just feel like keeping Holland is just sensical but I'm open to it I guess we weren't we podcasting like months ago about like you can't have everybody they're all everyone's so good and now we're going through this like e where it's like no one's quite there happens with the fixtures I mean that's yeah it just so happens we're in a sort of transition week with fixtures too so yeah um oh I guess I'm GNA actually be in 28 points Brandon once I once I get that Robinson Point subbed in there you things are looking up for old Josh Landon all of a sudden VY somehow nicked a bonus Point while we were talking today he has gained a bonus Point how why is this happening this year all of a sudden these bonus points Josh is a good actor I see the DMS open with FPL Towers negotiating the exra bonus Point first party pump and D scham I know with this yellow cards get punished too much in this game in my opinion uh there's too many punishment oh you want talk about BPS scoring system yeah oh that's everyone's favorite topic right uh all right so I think um end the stream yeah yeah all right so I think that oh I had one final question for you guys which was basically um we talked a little bit about Lewis we talked a little bit about um vardal a little bit about foden are there any other I mean because the southender match is obviously a fantastic match are there any other possible fantasy assets on man city I know they the champions league as a factor and then you know but but let's say that we kind of get a predictable Champions League 11 is there is there anybody um I think you've named plenty that's all we need okay like like there's like because I mean like there could be Defenders or yeah is there any Edge in any or any or even other Defenders you know like I'm just curious is there any Edge to be G picking someone off off the table vodin is the choice and he's not a choice you'll talk yourself into getting Bernardo Silva or doku and these are these These are paths to pain yeah yeah I guess I guess you're right um all right so there there we are um and um uh I think that's it I think we can wrap this up guys yes yeah and um

anything Happy Trails Dave hail cheaters like And subscribe hail cheaters thanks guys bye",16179,14521,all right ready yep all right here we go is it like officially live were officially live okay all right hail cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast we are doing a live recording today this is the first time you and i have done a weve done in person before but in person with like the new setup on youtube its all new and different were also not usually next to each other like this weve done like london trip side by side youre familiar with the wedding photographer a thing of like youre going to have to get close together like closer than youre comfortable doing just to make the shot you were saying its like the man of constant sorrow brother and speaking of brothers were here with producer dave i am a man there we go nice to see you all right on so were here to talk about our terrible game week eights i think im the only one of the three of us who had moala today so i experienced some joyful emotion on sunday you ended up what eight 10 12 points all told 12 points from mo so then the great regret is its always in hindsight well i should have been more courageous and i should have captain mosala instead of holland so one thing were going to have to talk about on this episode is holland has three blanks in a row where for all of the people who didnt believe the theory of no roger new no de bruyne is going to eat away at hollands points potentially then some people are saying it was me however it is it is saints next week for man city so we theres no way out right for holland owners once you think youre going to get out this southampton pulls you back in its though because i think the question now is ide a vacuum loading up on man city players ahead of the saints match would make a lot of sense but its weirdly i still dont feel confident theyre gonna keep clean sheet even against saints like i feel like somehow theyre gonna have one moment where they just get sloppy and see to a goal and i also dont know what midfielder i would have it may be that you have to wait until the champions league this week to see if to see if like i was saying like if bernard silva doesnt start in the champions league like he might be someone to target if foden doesnt start in the champions league i dont know if that makes me feel better or worse about him starting at the weekend there are a few paths for me to get foden without at without being at the expense of like a premium mid where the whole arsenal bournemouth match is another thing that were going to have to unpack but celba owners now have a free role on a cheaper defender assuming you dont want to stick with arsenal defense and i dont think we can make a real case for that right now but that is a great place to make money to upgrade in my case anthony gordon to somebody like foden right but were still waiting for foden to do something this season you were just reading about the covid conspiracy someone well i dont know its a conspiracy but someone in our app replies said that co f recently had covid and then hes still recovering from it then he may potentially have long co okay so i dont know well so were not were not doctors dave are you a doctor no but i play one on the podcast dr dave okay well that would be a rational explanation were trying to figure out whats happening with foden youre like theres something going on but its been happening for years so has he had long co for years maybe i is he patient zero is what we need to figure out last year he was starting matches this early in the season right like his f returns last season are pretty solid i think it was they have double digit goals and assists last year somewhere in that range at least pfa player of the year its hard to deny no were not here to talk about fodens talent level were here to talk about the mystery of whats going on at man city and like that performance against wolves felt in some way similar to the performance against arsenal where they had to hammer away at a good defensive performance from wolves until they finally got the breakthrough at the very end also it felt a little bit like city playing fulam last two weeks ago where the chances that wolves got were on the counter and were pretty good chances and one of them they finished and the other they simply didnt so it could be looking a lot worse for city right now in the table but liverpool now one point ahead can we start talking about liverpool as like title cont not sure not like its farfetched to imagine that this stacked team would be title contenders but arsenal are just like quickly fading away from this discussion now back to the glory days of city versus liverpool and i think this was the match the arsenal bournemouth match and we lets what lets do a little reset here im freestyling here i enjoy your freestyling but we put together this nice running order and i think that we should try to stick to it so lets lets kick things off so game week eight kicks off with h the spurs spurs west ham match on saturday morning you and i go to smithfield hall meet up with a listener that was nice shout out to fpl rock on twitter darren wonderful guy enjoyed chatting with him hes been and seen football played all over planet earth so its just interesting hearing what hes seen and also his fpl thoughts he run some fpl content out of a podcasting cuba got some spanish content so that was that was very cool so shout out to darren thanks for coming out and the scene is always good at smithfield hall its a west ham supporters bar as well as a man utd bar so we walked into great sorrow and then we emerged victorious with a very man utd fans just cant understand how they got away with it right i think that it was right so the match on saturday morning though was pretty interesting right i think you had a little bit of saka drama which we could talk about more in a second but one option was to move saka to sun which that was the only move that would have worked out this week you did get a fod in assist late right but like thats not four points not that significant but i think what was the bigger news was that you had poro blank brennan johnson blank and blank in a four in a four goal spurs match which i feel like that like it just the whole vibe this week was a real post international break like a little some shaky thought the matches today for example were like surprisingly low quality i thought the spurs or not the chelsea liverpool match i thought was foul heavy and and the man city wolves was just odd like i just felt like it was it was such a especially the second half it was just like a real slog and weve seen a lot of that with man city recently youre looking for much more dynamism from man city they seem to just insist that they can pass through any low block but ultimately i think they just need more players be it greish doku svino who can just beat a man and there that just to create something in the box which makes it even more confusing as to why fodens rollout has been so slow because he is good at operating in those tight spaces and he could certainly help holland had precious few touches one or two moments that could have easily been goalscoring opportunity but youre left feeling like not awesome about holland and this city team despite that victory so lets get into i think like just to go through the weekend which i think might be the a cleaner you want we want to talk what do we just want to talk about sunday and should we just keep it you want you want to work backwards here brandon because we just we just saw these matches so maybe sure maybe working back maybe we just we scrapped the running order already this lovely running order that we put together this morning what are your fpl takeaways from liverpool chelsea i think my takeaways are that chelsea are not a defensive team there was that moment where i think that sanchezs value was inflated by the pens save the 15p pointer that he got y and then they ran into some yellow card suspensions and there was a lot of like ingame rotation with the backline from moresa against chelsea so you were saying you feel like moresa rotates too much too much like what that i feel like mesas hit upon something with chelsea that is certainly working in the attack in the attack aspect but now he just needs to find some cohesion and some continuity and hes not doing that at all and i hes just working with the situation that he got where he had too big a squad and hes just trying to challenge these players to show him where that continuity was would be but i still think its palmer or nobody from the attack nichas jackson did have a pretty good goal though so if you have ridden out a small drought with nico jackson suddenly you should be booed by what happened hes the cl he is the like one of those players that can be hard to evaluate in fantasy because he has like truly terrible body language like when you watch him play he looks like hes absol miserable out there he in that like who we put in there its like mz ozil famously was a bad body language player but who else was like i feel like were missing some other of course brandon always with the what do you think dave am i forgetting a bad body language player here how do you r your body language dave right the great thing about new york is theres so much to see and do im think thinking about that they might be giant song but my body language right now its its hurting but it was good early in the week and then just as the games have gone on like you like you said these sunday games its just dragging us down it has nothing to do with you going to raves at for exactly rolling in exactly but i like to finish that point on chelsea the wingers as good as they are individually theyre still trying to find like it does feel like moresa wants netto to work and and sancho did not have a great game moww is just feast or famine with him fantasy wise so like as much potential as there is with chelsea then you get to liverpool your feelings on liverpool so you only have trent how are you feeling about trent is that a good use of money for you at the moment hes honestly been fine when i think about how my seasons gone so far trents performance is not at the top of the list by any means getting three consecutive blanks from holland has honestly been a bigger problem for me considering this week was a little bit different this week he was heavily captain the last two weeks though he was a little bit of a differential captain it didnt come through at all and so my i have like just larger problems with man city that im trying to figure out i ive dodged at bolet by not having rico lewis like thats one of the like thats one of the few thats worked out reasonably well but i thought salah had a real like a modern salah performance right where he like he struggles to take people on still but now hes now hes heads up looking for the past which has unlocked another aspect of his game and you saw him trying a lot from wide to find his teammates in this match as you have through a lot of this season so as i am ive been like over the last few weeks looking for the jumping off point to move salah to either saka or palmer and after this weekend i think im gonna gota keep going with salah though they play arsenal away in gw n so but what would your palmer lets see palmer plays newcastle next week and newcastle are a total mess right now and anthony gordon has just been hes hes turned from a cheeky differential into just like weirdly killing my weeks from his miss pens to the blanket home against brighton so that is a huge opportunity i think for palmer against newcastle in gw nine i think so is that worth a transfer that would be the question like is it worth so you have two transfers right going into game week n as do i dave do you have did you make a transfer this week or no i have five i think do you i think wow thats amazing so you got to five ive been waiting for someone to get to five transfers i think hold on let me double let me live check here right no i got four sorry is that right one more week to go dave i think i could roll i could roll wow because youre doing youre like what like a 3k right now in the world something like that i was counting no i think i saw that you and dave are roughly exactly in the same position good so hes doing equally terrible thats great seven figures me too sadly so im on 30 points right now thank you mo i did terrible on saturday the only thing i got was a goal from morgan rogers it was blanks from hs the minus three from celba and just bad news all around fulham didnt just didnt coales even though well okay im already moving to saturday but just for my team you are you got like a youre all over the place right now youre ready to talk about fham i think its because the camera is on you and youre youre feeling like a lot of pressure feeling the pressure its like albert brooks in broadcast news but 30 points with just dean henderson to go like 65m gw rank moving me to around 16m overall so ill certainly be finishing on a red error for the week and im just waiting for the moment to kick on man i think a lot of people are feeling that way im on 26 i have e and henderson to go and so im im feeling the same i was feeling okay going into this match and i if id gotten anything from palmer or trent i would feel okay about this week but im already looking at the i think the average score is 31 so im already five under average and so its and a hasnt done anything the entire season right one attack in return in eight weeks so or seven weeks well see what he does tomorrow so but i think its one of those weeks where its its its like a good week to have a bad week as they say theres its not like theres like a massive swing or anything like that so dave what about you like how are you looking on your points so far this weekend 20 something like everyone else 24 25 watkins and rogers well talk about full them but like we said tomorrows game is gna be the clinch the hammer chriswood i got going e its its gonna be a its gonna be an inter its gonna be a moving a move week thats true and i have henderson so maybe henderson ill have a fantastic match i am on 27 because i get i get one point off the bench i get robinson in for greaves i thought robin a yellow but apparently he didnt he put they put a yellow up on the screen at least on the us version of the broadcast and it was an errant a graphic he comes through with a clean one should we take a quick moment we because were recording early on saturday weve got some more uk listeners in the youtube chat our friend fpl yellow army also sebastian front also has five free transfers so thats a were on the lookout for these rare people these unicorns the are there any questions in the chat dave you want we had a we had a an addition to the bad body language of bruno bruno hes a great hes a great bad body language player for that was an interesting moment in that man utd match where there was an a camera angle on bruno where i thought he had joined the turkish hair transplant brigade his hair just looked full this weekend for some reason so but i backed away from that theory and i just feel like i need to say bruno your hair looked you had a great hair day on saturday thats remember when sal used to have the long hair and it was just like not a great i bet it looked cool off the pitch but it was like it didnt did not work on if it rained it was not a great look that hair had goals in it though thats true that hair did have goals in it thats thats a fair point thats a fair point all right well lets so lets return back to saturday as you were saying its i think the fullam villa match its i think my take away morgan rogers scored a goal watkins scored a goal i dont think theres anything super dramatic in that my big fantasy to take away from that match would have been that r jimnez got the full 90 minutes took scored a goal early nice goal as well and played i thought pretty well throughout he only had the one the one big chance but i think if theres been a little bit of hesitation around him just because of his injury history and stuff like that i this feels like the season wherere were all struggling to find that cheap third forward and maybe maybe that doesnt exist maybe its chris wood honestly hes hes the only consistent one i i want to ask brandon about what he feels about jimenez because i saw after the match hes the top value forward on mikel tos table holland hum men a buy brandon why not fulam are an attacking team if nothing else right now and muns just hes lost his spot to ra raul had a fantastic international break with mexico scoring a screamer and fulam do have good fixtures right terrific run everton brenford palace wolves in the next four thats a strong run i although one other takeaway from saturday is two clean sheets in a row for everton they have wred the ship and we i dont know about you guys i just assumed this would happen eventually it was it was like they had last season they had they had a ton of injuries to start the season right and so we and even now they brw is still not back although he should be soon thats one of the unfortunate things is that probably michael keane who had a great match today or le from f perspective hes at 41m but i think you have to avoid kean unfortunately because i do think that he had been dropped for br branway last year and so i think hes a doubt but you did have the u michael kane though remains a great actor micha michel michael kane fantastic and when he scores points his voice the trip the trip that was good we needed that dave but i but speaking of everton i think that for anyone whos looking like you and i like one of the things that screwed us one of the reasons that you and i and many others are on less than 30 is he has a cba right and not just getting negative3 from him but the fact that anyone who had rya got hurt by that limited all of arsenals attacking sort potential in that match sure it hurt me having hovers and the damage was already done to saka owners so saka being a miss there was just it was an interesting wave waveform of content leading up to the gw talking about saka andy martin i think probably had the cleverest thing where he drove down to arsenals hotel in bournemouth and took a photo of himself and where they had saw the team getting off the bus to do a height comparison hes based hes based in south africa too so thats thats incredible commitment so i hope you have diamond status andy to afford that flight because to do that last minute is crazy theres a lot of stur and drang about who knew what do we know anything josh about team sheets what do you mean do we you getting inside leaks right so okay i okay i wouldnt know the first thing of how to get them to be so you so you and i thought about this and so just for anyone who isnt on twitter and congratulations if you arent thats thats fantastic good exactly and twitter is a is a dying social media network that has now been like its primarily fpl as far as i can tell its like those are the people who are like hanging on and theyre just everyone is absolutely furious with each other and this is like this been going on for like a year and a half i bowed out like unfortun i now turned twitter into like a place where i just like share like podcast information fpl twitter is like going to a sunday family dinner with your like extended relatives often it is cordial but you all know that you all secretly hate other or its its like a its like a family trip that go thats one day too long and and i just think u okay the coup i have a couple of thoughts about this and so the issue was that there was a lot of information about saka or a lack of information about saka and most of the people who are making fpl i dont like the phrase content creators i dont know why but like a lot of people who make fpl youtube videos and podcast whatever we advocating to keep saka and thats where we i just my rationale was that he always starts he always starts artetta is not one of these managers like if artetta says that hes close to starting my expectation is that he probably will start its not like i dont think its like whereas other managers like eddie how for example right you genuinely have no idea like if how says that eso is we plan to have him start tomorrow that means its like 5050 right like you genuinely cant believe what he says but i think and so there was a lot of debate about this it turned out like all of these people dropped saka and you and i cool guys that we are didnt even have saka so we were able to avoid that we had no one to drop we had no one to drop so and dave you had you had saka yourself right and so you kept him youre also in the club i was in i was in the you were all family in the club no that was my thought too its like worst case scenario hes not in squad youll get sing off the bench at samano for sub so its that was a pretty easy solution but like we were talking about before i think it was a sound theory because the pictures coming up are turning for saka they with no odard hes looking all off so but i the also the al alternatives werent super clean like its a double transfer to palmer or its foden who we all we already talked about is a risk and i love foden but so son was a risk too a little bit consistent as well hes got a son sun has not been a like a super reliable fantasy asset this season sun was clearly past fit for the weekend but i agree with you both like it was spurs were in at least some goal scoring form without him you never know how slowly andrew is going to want to bring him back there so there was some risk there too but that turned out to be the best mo i think in some ways that were a little bit on the outside of this of this world because a lot of the content that we do were not were not doing a lot of deadline streams right were not like talking to people 10 minutes before partially because we dont were were still asleep when the deadline hits right its like the deadline is 600 am east coast time it is not i am not up at in most cases every on then if its like if its crucial ill ill do it but in general im not waking up at 515 to check things im just im going with it and so i think so we dont necessarily get like hit by this stuff as much but i think this theres an idea out there that and like this just speaks i think a little bit and i like forgive me if im going off fpl here a little bit but like just the relationship that people have with people who create content a little bit and this idea that like hey you were saying to me yesterday hey like no ones making like a ton of money on this theres this belief that theres this iory tower in which somebody who makes just go to i implore you to go to our youtube channel and look at the quality of this were what are you taking the camera the face okay well okay back up i know youre talking about us here by the way im in joshs house right now and i dont know the money seems to be rolling in here so you are in a parlor so but none nonetheless the point is that there is this like class structure and content creators are a like reaping this incredible revenue from it while not doing any work like the people who do make money like from it like work their tails off and we so whatever that would be the point can i ask you a question though about that so even putting the money aside or including the money even whats the incentive to lie right does that mean youre g to watch more contribute to someone who lies to you whats the whats the game theory of this im not understanding theres some edge in duding three or 400 people or whatever right about what youre doing its like theres theres 12m people or whatever 11m people playing fantasy like the amount of people that you would gain an edge on is so small right and well youre not making money by playing fpl because that be against the rules right well theres that too so i dont understand like what even is the argument of why but i think thats the sub i think thats the subex the subtext of people getting mad about this stuff is that that they are doing it to get an edge over the opposition right i think that to me is what people are mad about this idea that theres like that they have secret knowledge theyre not sharing in order to like get more rank and i think youre rightly making the case and again we dont need to like belabor this because even so like andy said he might change it two days before i watched a video so i dont see where people get this and just this idea that like that people have i dont think theres that much see im in plenty of like dm threads with like these exact people and a lot of them like i believe me like a lot of them are talking minutes before the deadline trying to like cas me about asking everybody else if they know anything right its not like its not like theres like the secret feed and we know the cheaters are pro leaks you guys will share any leaks that no ones ever done it though its a the problem is our listener base pro right there proof were breaking conspiracies here live i think its its ultimately to our benefit that our listener base is not a twitter base and so its so funny like i think of my friends no and louise who are producers of the pod and every now and then ill talk to them and theyre just they do not pay attention to any of this stuff and they think like its insane that anybody does and im like thats probably like even though they manage a fantasy team the joy they derive is is watching the matches of the weekend and exactly and they have a mini league of their own and i we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and that a lot of the anger that people have about fantasy stems from caring about overall rank right and i think that this is just something i think like maybe this like has to be like a theme for us this year which is like invest in your mini leagues invest in headtohead leagues invest in stuff that you can do with smaller groups of people where you have a better chance of winning because if your goal is to finish in the top 10000 out of 11m people your odds are about as good as its like its not like winning the lottery but its about like not as good as arsenal winning the league you should say exactly youre talking about investing time id say theyre lower than that talking about time investment right time in all of it so its just like its its just not i just think like theres i think our goals should be focused on and like find like find like again like yes watch the matches enjoy them find moments of joy in that of course but i think just like looking purely from a fantasy point of you if youre if youre only thinking about overall rank its probably a quick way to just spend a lot of week and i feel guilty of this too spent a lot of time getting frustrated right like if i asked you like right now i am feeling frustrated with my season right im like in the millions like davis and i youre not that far into the hundreds thousands i at 16m are exactly so like were all like a rough season and but if i look at like and i have to force myself to do this right but if i looked at our mini leagues even like the ones that are like more competitive where i would like to win i maybe 30 points back 35 like its nothing right theres 30 weeks to go in the season like its so long plus the mystery chip thats gonna change everything exactly maybe the mystery chip will just be like you click the button and you get the leaks you get the leaks or its like or its like a lottery and its like you just hit a button you get like someone gets an extra 100 point someone get an extra 200 like who knows whats gna happen the mystery chip yes well so thats thats whats going on thats an update on whats going on in the fpl twitter space speaking of conspiracies though do we need to go back to arsenal and talk about further red card drama for them what did you make of the civa red card and like dean rice saying to the officials after the match it happens to us every week well i thats just like thats a self every manager is full of selfpity and and has there a lot of like you mean like listen like its it i to me its and everyones everyone who is like provar is gonna hate this but to me its like its another v problem which is that it force like theres no once you look at v theres no way not to call that a red card right because it is by every technical rule like an off like its its hes the last man hes the last defender and so you have to do but the referee on the pitch called it a yellow and that from a from like an enjoyment standpoint and ultimately from a fantasy standpoint too depending on how many arsenal assets you had its like its the its it like it made it made for a worse match right and so its like that is whats frustrating to me and i just think that vr i dont know the exact same play happened today against with liverpool chelsea where tosen took joe to down within the first 10 minutes of the match thankfully they didnt carbon cop and oliver in the var boo decided to stick with the yellow card instantly too which i think was smart it was like four i dont think you arrive was like 4 seconds in he was like nope this were just not gonna call this right so you do feel for arsenal getting hit with all these like minor infractions that lead to red cards but i fluky it is fluky and i have this theory that i think artetta and anyone whos watched the all or nothing amazon documentary about ettas season with that season with arsenal where artetta is just a guy who enjoys putting out these like big brain nba theories about how to play football and how to be tactical and i think his weirdness is now in the heads of all of these arsenal players so theyre like overthinking all of these instances on the pitch and trying to gain an edge like artetta tries to gain an edge in the press conference room of like lying about players injury status and then hes got his players on the pitch doing weird similar types of things but with trying to like walk that red card line or delaying the game and all that stuff i think its i just think its fluky honestly and i think if you look at all the all the situations its you had a time wasting right thats thats isnt that what got trer knocked out of the match in the man city right its like time wasting and you had the dean rice i dont think should have been a red card it was a second yellow and a red but like i thought that one was like another was that was that is that time wasting too so same exact same thing that trer did so so two time wastings and then and then a technically accurate red card so i think that is all just like fluky stuff thatll that will get wiped away but i am curious about the clean sheet part of it and the and i think there is like a like an actual fpl angle to this and whether we think my feeling is this and you guys tell me if you disagree you had a lot of a lot of international tournaments this summer right and so a lot of players came back late a lot of top players especially defenders center like a bunch of center backs top clubs were playing not ben white as we all know but many others of course now hes a right back mostly but i think that you so they didnt necessarily have enough time to practice together and i think that i think there so a little bit of that a little bit of theres so much money in the premier league now that even bournemouth level clubs can get like aelon type players right like you just like you can like bring in like talented brazilians to be your forward even if youre like the 15th best team in the premier league imagine shakiri at stoke city its its that and so i think thats part of it too its just like its i dont think you get like in la liga or the bundesliga like this level of talent like at the in the bottom third of the of the league and so i think that affects clean sheets maybe like more increasingly but i but i do think ultimately long term that we will get there again and maybe this is just something that we just need to like think about going forward which is just dont focus dont invest too much money in your defense the first half of the season and the second half of the season is when you can start to turn the dial a little bit because i feel like we see this every single year with man city which is that they have this run where they can see a bunch of goals and then the final 10 weeks of the season no one can score on them right it is like they one nil their way to a title and i just dont i just think were gonna see that again this year what do you guys think dave man city that there theyre a punchline defensively at least in fantasy terms how close are you as of today in considering a city defender for the run you brought this up and i just mely said like you like i just ive gone through the ederson ringer weve all had like josh you said rico lewis he is hes probably a buy still because hes starting every match so he and he does get forward a little bit too will be the bandwagon during this transfer window because the run continues for city is he scored his second goal of the season and he finished last season so strong that people will remember that so i think cba to guardal is probably the algorithmic preference for going into gw nine thats interesting that makes a lot of sense im surprised i havent thought about that more seriously thats a pretty logical move i know but like you just said that long point you made i think was good though its like why would we have that undermine the point i just it makes a lot of sense can i spend more money on my defense ignore everything i just said and plus trent like if we have him and gabriel sure thats why ric loose might feel more tempting because you can use that money so what is how do you measure the upside of guardal it is its the same with trent where youre just talking about the high ceilings but it has been so variable the returns on defenders that i im sure an equally compelling case could be made to just getting all 45s well lets well theres not that many good can you bring up the fpl hub heat map for guardal exactly i let me see if i can pull that up in real time without things getting too chaotic here but i am i am okay so lets lets say that like we like that we believe what ive just said which is that you want to maybe scale back a little bit on your defense and i feel this way a little bit about trent where i do wonder if that money could be spent invested and a and like a better third forward perhaps i have jamie vardy at the moment like that cant last im gonna keep im gonna keep jamie vardy ponzi scheme is i know exactly i did finally get a goal this week thankfully b pump and dump over here exactly that goal exactly if we all get b its better for josh if this if this were draft league then id be be even better id be trying to you switch him off but so hes got to go eventually and maybe theres like a i dont know like maybe i can find someone else it could just be i go back to chris wood but lets say that i want to start taking some money on my defense and put it in my midfield and forward lines and i think and maybe the other the other way would be that weve talked before about how you just want to try to have three out of four of these like expensive premium assets and that just may be the thing that you need to do and that youre going to always get something and i think we saw that this week right like in play but and when i say four im thinking saka holland palmer and salah right those are like the big four the big four fantasy assets this season i think and it seems like every single week youre gonna get like one of those will carry you if you have them now you could have had holland holland saka and palmer and palmer this week and that would have been three blanks but i think without saka playing i think if saka had played thats a totally different story im going to ask you a hypothetic here josh dave i want to hear your opinion too imagine holland blanks against southampton at home at the edie hot you laugh and you think like how improbable it is right but itll be four blanks in a row and in those blanks you have some weak opposition you look at the injuries surrounding the club how close would you be to dropping holland if he were to blank against southampton is that a conversation you to even entertain it wouldnt be at the top of my priority list still im going to make a decision off one week but also we had a question on the youtube of are you is this hurting the coland triple captain shout against how i think i think it is talking about dumping him people are talking about triple captaining him like hurts it i dont know i dont know how you can triple captain him at the moment like i think hell score this next weekend but if there was a say like foden and im sorry well say foden and de bruyne returns from his injury midweek in the champions league and there was that dramatic a shift and how you expected man city to line up against southampton potentially but yes as it is given the state of play i just cannot of fathom triple captaining holland right now what do you think dave i dont know maybe dibling in if they could do give it to dibling for the end of the season im thinking the other side the galaxy brand they keep making goals thats true dibling 45 right im just im a like you josh i enjoy by the way on the on the patreon pods you go through some of the odds of the anytime goal scorers i think right im ill be honest im a slave to those odds because like those are efficient markets usually and just hollands just always very good odds to do something so i dont see myself dropping them it is like they have to it feels like pep will figure this out its a little bit like like were talking about d and everton earlier its like this idea that things arent working and theyre not feeding the ball to holland is like a problem that cant be fixed is i think wrong right like in gandan and berard silva and phil foden whenever he gets over his long covid in the years to come i dont know i who know im not im not planting that in the world that was just what somebody said in one of our replies i think that you have like eventually theyre going to figure maybe jack relish needs to get back in there like they need like somebody whos like a better creator right im not sure doku is as good of a is greish on the left and so i think that theyre and theyre missing rodry but i just i do think that pep is the premier leagues best manager and i think that hell eventually and eventually like as in like 20 weeks i think like by this weekend possibly hes going to figure it out but to go back to my question about defense lets say we wanted to take the money out looking at these fixtures like the next seven this i almost never looked seven fixtures ahead by the way i think five or six is as far as i ever want to look this because too many things change to people get injured but are there a couple of teams that you would recommend somebody targeted if they were looking to drop celba or if they were looking to clear up money to bring in lets say saka gets a clean bill of health and its a terrible week to bring in saka but like lets say lets say you want to bring in palmer and you want to keep saka while youre doing it who would be some sheep defenders that you might look at i like still like naam forest great stats i am haunted by that assist that ana had against liverpool to hudson ooi earlier this season i think and they have at least two good fixtures coming up with theyre haunted like because you wanted to im haunted just in like i think about it all the time im not haunted like it affected my life its like its like a 19th century like english novel spooky season i am doing a lot of opium though to go with the maybe that something to do with how i seea everywhere but i do but they have lester away and then wam at home and west ham just the implosion continues and even newcastle at home you have to like for forest so i think you mentioned everton before and everton have this newfound defensive form im curious about these fixtures though for everton fulham even though theyre hosting fulham are an attacking team very capable of scoring we talked about the run that raul is on and then probably the two best defensive fixtures for everton are away from home with southampton and west ham and then they finish off this mini run of theirs with brenford at hosting at goodison park who is also a pretty adept fork i wonder if thats a little stand that they have outside the stadium how could it not be how could the best the best sausages this side of the the ts like this which i know it is does not run as far north as that but so if im comparing everton and forest thats my little like te aet there im im going forest i was making a tiny shout for udogie as a cheaper route into the spurs defense the problem right now is youre not getting clean sheets anywhere right and so you ideally this one of the reasons im not like dying to get rid of trent because im like well at least he has different like multiple routes to points right like sometimes ill look into a clean sheet and sometimes ill ill get an attack in return but aogi has been like a reasonably attacking asset for for spurs and so he might be somebody poro is still the top poro has set pieces over udi hes more consistent defensively he does shoot more he had a great opportunity off of corner kick this on saturday and some would argue that vanen is roughly the same price says udi and maybe hes a little bit more con consistent i dont know udis had a very strange season hes had moments where hes been very defensively inept but thats just like a read outside of the fantasy game its just all about returns and i do see what youre seeing josh where he is getting into the box a bit more when theyre pushing down that left hand side of the pitch its just that hes 49m right so hes hes pretty cheap like you could you could move and they have like a pretty decent run of fixtures palace villa villas a tough fixture but then if switch and fulam at home two the three after that so i dont what do you think dave about the spurs defense in general its been a source of some frustration the last few weeks i think i think parros the obvious move if youre gonna do a civa replacement so but its not im not super excited and i to consult the heat maps on new doggy i dont have a heat map here but heat map over here por 55m is poro so hes point6 more than than ad dogy but he does have its five blanks in six for poro as well which is a lot for like a to me its like if im if im gna a defender that costs more than five million i want some i i want to be averaging some return whether its clean sh attack return like every other match right because its quite a lot of money when you can fluke your way into clean sheets of any old 45m well thats what im saying is it even worth at that point because then just go the clean sheets with like forest or brighton or anyone di and a dogies just got the one assist so far in the season youre not gonna get a return from a defender every other game it seems like at the moment so exactly maybe trent gets you the closest yellow army makes a good point on the chat it was anthony elena who got that assist well so im still haunted by ana im trying to figure out why spectre cant you cant make out the shapes its its like a smoke smokey vision it could be grandma it could be grandma im not sure grandma thats i think thats the title for todays podcast it could be grandma and other thoughts on game week nine all right well lets anything else that you want to discuss we can we can move on and talk about game week n in a second here but any other final thoughts on on the matches that we saw over the weekend i think we probably covered everything the one newcastle that is the one where i just its surprising to me theyve had a number of good fixtures and just feels like the vibes are off mag we need a vibe shift with newcastle sometime soon it is all it all stems we thought that all of newcastles good fortune and good form stemmed from jool linton it turned out it was kieran trippier the whole time and as he has faded from the team so has the form so all right i think its over for lets lets move on lets talk about game mc99 just quickly before we do i want to give a quick shout out to everyone who sports the podcast on patreon you can go to patreon including our friend over here hes not just our friend hes our patreon supporter maybe one day you can become a patreon supporter and be right in this room like and subscribe like and subscribe dave is in the the frer its a thousand dollar a month well worth it though like a frat its like a frat its like initiation and everything no you can go to patreoncom making will occur after this recording again i dont make the rules you can go to patreoncom cheating to support the podcast you get an extra podcast each week we also do were on the were on the discord the discord is im honestly and i know i always say this and its it but it like the way it continues to evolve and expand its there are people on there who its its a its it it feels like its genuinely replaced social media for a lot of people and i think in a way thats positive and theres lots of little sub i think because you and i are mods on there we like we see every little subgroup right and theres little theres little we see everything but theres these little south american i see what you and the norwegian channel are up to okay dont think that were not watching meetups and theres like theres theres a betting channel and theres fashion and like music and nfl lot of nfl so youre the mod of nfl exactly theres nfl fantasy leagues theres all kinds of stuff on there and so its a fun commun so if you feel like if this saka situation and youre just like my god im just so sick of this stuff and you want to be somewhere where like things are just a little calmer and people arent screaming each other all the time you can go to patreoncom support the podcast and even at the lowest pledge level you get access to the discord and so thats just a nice way to maybe get some access to some new fantasy content and then u were also were gonna start a contest sometime soon i think we talking about maybe doing it before the second half this time around just because i know some people are getting a little frustrated with their overall ranks and it might be a chance to get to juice things up maybe well do it like after the next juice we have thankfully you i know you guys are sick of the premier league already we got another national break coming up in a couple of weeks and so it might be a time to to kick off one weekend of premier league was plenty get me out of here i know exactly already gearing up for the next ib so we should do like an off the side fpl challenge league its like you guys like i dont even know what fpl challenge is and you were explaining to me i was like sounds fun and if its a daily fantasy theres always you dont have to worry about your current team so maybe can do like a second half like league with that its a little its a little bit like d and d where its like you need someone to be like the like i just mean like you need someone to like be the like what are they dungeon master dungeon master you just need someone to be that was the word i thought it was then i was like i doubted myself at the last second but you need somebody to safe politically to say dungeon master exactly im not gonna get cancel for saying dungeon master no but its its a its like you need someone to whos like enthusiastic who leads the chart right and this goes back to the mini thing we talking about before too this is like patreon stuff aside but if you if youre not if the person who leads your mini league isnt like actively managing it or like engaging it maybe you need to be that person its like its like be the be the change exactly thank you obama thanks obama all right well lets move on then i want to look ahead to gw nine i think the captaincy we have a couple of questions too but just to kick things off captaincy i think is relatively straightforward this week right i think its going to be i very hard for me to vision not going with early holland even with those blanks but if holland were to get injured or if there was some risk of him starting right theres some leak that comes out that hes not expected to start this match like that then i think you could you could consider and bomo right i think hosting nip switch could be one ando blanked this week for the first time in quite a while and just imagine having an asset where its surprising when they blank and his name is not earling holland right it was it was surprising to see on bomo blank this week and he has a plum home fixture apologies to our buddy james holland but ipswitch just have not got going this season at all and for all the talk about how well managed they are and how theyre theyre like canny enough to play in the premier league they are a team to target at this point as far as im concerned at as far as everyones concerned im going out on a limb here i understand but okay so like thats so captain c fairly simple vice captain i think i probably will end up putting on emb maybe ill put on co palmer that would be the other logical vc pick herz against everton well thats an interesting question because i do think that everton is a team where you could target their defensive assets too and i wonder if that could be to me guess like maybe the most likely scenario was like 11 for that match but i one nil everton win wouldnt be like a shocking result there so what about in terms of you guys your teams this week maybe well start with dave what are you you have five you have four transfers im rolling no matter what to get the five just for the bit just for the banter for the just to see that number in the in the bus team next week are you are you are you being serious like guess think i have a cra problem because of a s a half problem so wed share your team but we just because weve got this like hacked setup for the todays stream im not gonna do no i wild card a few weeks ago so i had to fairly template wild card team but no diaz which has been a good move but then of the sano smith row eighth attacker like trick rotation thing so i dont know i you could so theres might be some opportunities to fiddle around with stuff but again i dont know who is a screaming b this week as weve talked about so i think if you i think what lets say like you had the luxury of not needed to make any big changes this week i think watkins would be someone you could target well you already have them but i just in general sing to just general sorry a good speaking of a good question in the chat around spurs of there scoring goals but and brandon this is your pet topic of do you want someone a team to target thats scoring a lot of goals but its spread out or the concentrated tip of the spear of low scoring i know you feel strongly about this but it is frustrating to have senen and then four goal game and nothing so thats super frustrating but it seems fluky though too right exactly so i dont know if can we see it josh can we see it first hes hes done a two ex i know youre trying to rope me into simmons talk here but its i hes hes had returns in the two previous weeks right sank so i we have been seeing him round into fantasy shape he hasnt i dont think hes had a big match right i dont think weve seen him like even necessarily get like multiple attack and returns in a match so far i think to watch him play he is its so much hold up play from him and i think like some spurs fans would suggest that an will change those tactics depending on the opponent and i think west ham would be given their vulnerability on crosses and set pieces still it didnt feel like salanki was a huge part of that plan for him to be getting the final ball still he was playing very well as a hold up player but its just im not seeing the huge fantasy ceiling for i think and i think and i just pulled up his stats he had attacks in three matches in a row before this one takes long but he not you want the double digits so maybe sun is a possible outside play and theyre a little tricky too because you can see three matches in a row three attacking returns you before this blank and yet no bonus in any of those matches right and so that does get to the other problem of the old school back when man city were scoring four or five goals a match you needed to have kd b or aguero and if you had a like it was always tempting to get a bernardo silva type player right because theyd always be the one of the cheapest options in their d silva back when he was there but but often they would get one attack in return and no bonus right and so its like youre like ah is this worth 75m or whatever and so maybe we are a little bit there with salanki i think the problem is i dont know like what about brenan johnson dave youre a sore supporter like hes been hes been great hes on fire that could be a p but again its like its the price thing youre just like well hes not i dont mean to b down but like whos exciting to bring in its like hes so cheap hes almost not exciting youre like i have 5m in the bank thats not fun just psychologically the moves i know i think thats one of the reason i didnt bring him in this week either i just couldnt get excited enough about it if br johnson was 10 points too wed all have them its so true isnt that funny the way that works sometimes i know its so true and i dont know palmer the still the fixtures are not great i think what ill ill give a shout out to the content creators of so hey palmers banging them in but the pictures are gna turn so is he a buy and he hasnt been tough because pictures create points so and hes still okay took four shots today he had a big chance in the first half i think or biggish chance it was a big chance for him i dont maybe for a lesser player thats a low percentage chance but he did a i this was always going to be a tough match for him and i think newcastle at home id be very surprised if he didnt get some attack in return in that one but you guys we gloss over watkins for a second i do think that theres there is some potential there the question is like lets say you were scared off of foden but maybe but maybe you do want to drop cipa this week ahead of the run could you maybe go i dont know how much it depends how much money you have in the bank already but a move that was like watkins to what lewis for example excuse me let start where we going sba cba to lewis thats a big s but lewis would free up like 15m roughly i think some somewhere in that maybe a little less than that maybe like 12m now and maybe then you could go chris wood or somebody you whatever whoever your third forward is you could upgrade to watkins and i that wouldnt be terrible but then after this week watkins has spurs away liverpool away chelsea away three in the next four bor so hes almost like a get off i was looking at the drop so i dont know hes like a hold for this week but after that i dont know villa have a home fixture midweek on tuesday against bolognia for the champions league certainly that it good us some pork as well or get us in pork its theres some distance pork and goodis and pork but the pork pies are stronger through that entire corridor the bolog try the fried bolognia sandwich certainly im holding my transfers until we see those champions league what are what are the fixtures this week in the champions league so youve got villa hosting bologna you always get so emotion it looks like thats the only premier league club thats thats playing on tuesday then on wednesday youve got man city hosting sparta praha liverpool away arby leig which may be the trickiest of them lets see im just hunting around for the arsenal champions league fixture as if following champions league in america wasnt hard enough cu well working this new structure is diabolical these pictures are crazy i can follow its like its its a mix of one of the most difficult fixers you can imagine or the easiest fixer you played all season like are we sure its thats arsal arsenal hosts shakar donet on tuesday so villa and arsenal both home on tuesday and then city at okay liverpool on wednesday so should have europa league as well right on thursday you so lets see im im man united are away at fer aach on thursday hunting around here for lets see blah right there blah go up a little bit go up a little bit okay thank you for finding that and reading that chelsea are away in gree at pananos as discussed with cole palmer hes not even on their roster for hes still not on that okay no i dont think they submit a new roster until they get out of the group stage okay of the competition so hes free and easy hes its interesting you bring up like palmer is such a difficult player to not own right now because he is that guy but they have bad fixtures when is the right moment to get him i do feel like the newcastle fixture is good enough to just go for palmer and i am think im considering ways to downgrade celba or another player in my 11 to upgrade anthony gordon to palmer that would probably require three transfers so would not take a minus four just to get polymer in the midst of this run but i do feel like that is a great fixture you down are you could downgrade salo because as we saw today his returns are totally fluky and you got lucky so thats true i got lucky playing the variance with most the variance game with him as he moves ninth place in alltime premier league goal scorer why would you guys do if you had what would you guys do if you had diaz get rid of him no its i think so too the boil and unfortunately because theres another international break coming up in november it does seem like you and i brandon were talking about this morning arot does seem like a manager whos going to use the whole squad i salah is like one of those players hes like the so hes like the hes a hes a mov he also came back early from the international break which made it even easier but i think it as we have we are now seeing it for real right which is there are four players for five slots in front well see about jod he went off injured that but either way and cody thought was pretty geeko i thought was irrelevant he was very quiet darwin came on and put himself about he was like mr dark arts against chelsea this weekend but i thought that liverpool benefited from that he was distracted some of the chelsea defenders so as far as slot saw it i think he would be pleased with darwins performance sol could work his way behind him it seemed like when he was pushing up front was good and what about you brandon in terms of your transfers so i think if i look at my squad the problem players are celba with the red card and i feel like its im good going without arsenal defense right now i thought it feels like a coupon that the league gave us i was telling you this josh where when that wild card turn happened around gw six that was when rya and gabrielle was scoring his set piece goals looked unstoppable rya was getting a lots of fpl returns as well and then people moved off of cba to get those guys and that there is the double arsenal defense because we didnt wild card at that time we still had cba so now were in a position to just like for free just get off of the arsenal defense train while they go through this rough b batch of fixtures but if you have rya and gabrielle im not sure you can find a good enough reason to get rid of them so not certainly not right and the thing is once they get past this trio of rough fixtures its its its a fantastic run for them right so you just have to weather the storm even if it will storm we dont know arsenal are good enough to certainly clean sheet in any fixture so its cba and gordon and i need to just look at more options in terms of downgrading celba does that open up something more interesting for gordon to become right because if you lets say lets say you did like the one of the cheapest options which was you took you turn cbos around six million into maybe a little more or less into like mikeno one 43 that would open up fre that would free up 17m for you its still not enough for me to turn anthony gordon into palmer sure its its enough for me to turn hts into ali watkins so and hts is the tertiary player on the bubble for me where even though hes had a good run hes been great for arsenal this season i think given the shape the arsenal team is in theyre not probably not going to be scoring three or four goals anytime soon although as dave said the run for watkins gets worse after game week nine probably not its it feels like long term probably not like thats a transfer that its hard to like net out super ahead on that if howards plays 90 in midweek and the team looks a little ragged harts might move closer to my maybe he gets turned into watkins plan but w watkins has the same midweek week issue so ive got a lot of balls in the air here the other ele in the room for me is wild card but that to me wild card is all about how im going to do premium asset structure and i think still optimally assuming everyones healthy it feels like holland plus saka plus palmer and i need i feel like i want a wild card in order to get that and there are too many things in motion right now its not doesnt feel like a good week to make that put a steak in the ground i think i think in two weeks time when arsenals fixer run gets good that is a great time for you to wild card because you could go you could go to three options right and youd be itd be a good time to reset a little bit as far as my team just because ive got it pulled up here i will ill pick my team for next week 27 points thats brutal i know im telling you bud its its been a rough run okay you just start putting out some fake info to help your i know exactly so this is my squad right now for for gw nine it looks okay its its its like its an acceptable squad like if i had to do nothing i would be okay with that like if i were dave i would probably just save my transfer and have three i think there might be an opportunity here because i do have two transfers to change things around a little bit i think it feels like its last chance city for e i would like to see him do something in on in mondays match to feel confident in holding on to him i think who do palace host spurs its honestly not a bad fixture for him but so like that doesnt feel like the most urgent issue it would be great to get another man city asset and so i could look at as something as simple as cba vardal would be would be an option in that case it probably bench robinson i dont know its like and maybe hold one of my other transfers that might be that might be a possible move vardy i would like to drop eventually but i dont necessarily need to do that away to arsenal like not great but probably fine like its not something that im like again no ones keeping clean sheets so so moving like wasting a lot of money on defenders feels which i know undermines my gardial point but because its southampton theyve been so bad this season you could make an argument for that like theres the upside is there for gardial theres a chance of like a 15o level return and thats something worth shooting for so i dont know you guys looking at my squad do anything else stand out to you as like an urgent not having saka remains a big problem but i think i can fix that in a couple weeks i dont think thats a problem right now not for the liver not for the next couple weeks i dont want necessarily want them right now so i think to your point yet your weakest links are pretty like luxury moves so its your its your bench that might be the weakest link with g the greaves injury and the celba suspension you have no defenders to rotate or cover so but you wouldnt look to upgrade greaves to serious hamstring injury out for a month my goodness that could be mind games thats thats true who knows usually those things are like based on like lit like a literal comment from a manager its like a few weeks few weeks time well see them i do subscribe brandon though to the theory of if you lose a defender youre losing a maximum of two points none of them score anyways so and maybe thats the secret benefit so the f up to five free transfers you talk about that like a mini wild card well its an interesting strategy for fixing your bench because if you want need to fix your bench and you have one or two free transfers youre limited in what you can do and you often make compromises in terms of how creative you can be if you had three or four transfers you fix your bench and do something interesting with one or two starting players so it i think you can weather a benching storm for i look at my like if i look at my squad right now and you look at my 11 and i just were to swap out robinson for vardal then id have a squad that i liked for gw and i know like for podcast listeners they are not looking at my squad right now but its a pretty its its ive got watkins holland bardy up front momo rogers palmer e again all fine right and then as a i dont know like arguable but like spurs are just like conceding goals for fun so like it feels like thats a match where he could he could do something its almost baked into their approach right but im not going to waste a transfer on a keeper and and then con is fine even robinson would be okay i just dont expect f to keep a clean sheet in that match although they did a way to forest in a similar match a few weeks ago so not the most consistent so exactly so thats thats where i am lets lets wrap things up here with just a couple of questions shane asked about thoughts on defender strategy i think we covered that already so sam c asked about says solid with more points than holland he says by the time this match finishes and almost three million cheaper is crazy if you think about its all its solid as expensive as he is its three million cheaper than holland can we swerve holland and have some extra cash to spread around of course i blame the content creator calver not telling me sa is good that is a joke but okay so lets say after southampton regardless of what holland does is it is it time to consider moving him on or are we just rearranging deck chairs trying find the right premium is good i dont know what to say like we saw it today were just like he go by watching that match like hes gonna get pens sure and assists and i dont youll take along but i dont know like he had no clearcut im talking over you dave here but ive got a interesting point to make i was looking at you sol had no clearcut goal scoring opportunities and open play it was the pen and then he was creating chances for his teammates i still think hes hes below palmer saka and holland on the premium asset list all right i think so i think its pretty its pretty tight between all four of them again if i the other strategy that i could do this week and ill maybe give a little more thought would be to just keep saving transfers and stick to my guns and ultimately downgrade celba and trent and try to turn e into saka which would give me saka palmer holland and allow me to stick to my gun idea that you just want three out of four of these premium assets so that would be one option too id have to like do a little investigating how honestly i could get rico lewis and that might be enough if i turned celba into lewis trent into like a 45 that probably would be enough for me to turn a into saka so thats another possibility too all right so final questions from al aloha lounge she says has foden done enough to prove to pep to prove to pep that he needs to start no tell no historically or like its like who knows like how do you prove youre over long co dave youve had long covered for four years now you tell me im sorry i shouldnt make we havent seen how peps shirts look after foden has ironed them i assume this is how you prove your value to guardal its the little things like picking up the dry cleaning and like washing the dishes and that thing how good is the tea that foden is brewing that in the staff cafeteria i slept through the game so you guys tell me how he looked but foden they did start for one well thats not a good sign so hes not and he and he didnt influence the game at all after coming on apart from taking a well taken corner to deliver the jon stones goal so but that goes also back to the holland question of okay then what city asset are we just not having city players like it just seems crazy and then what the alternative like premium assets and theres not like super ones this week so thats why i just i just feel like keeping holland is just sensical but im open to it we werent we podcasting like months ago about like you cant have everybody theyre all everyones so good and now were going through this like e where its like no ones quite there happens with the fixtures thats it just so happens were in a transition week with fixtures too so im gna be in 28 points brandon once i once i get that robinson point subbed in there you things are looking up for old josh landon all of a sudden vy somehow nicked a bonus point while we were talking today he has gained a bonus point how why is this happening this year all of a sudden these bonus points josh is a good actor i see the dms open with fpl towers negotiating the exra bonus point first party pump and d scham i know with this yellow cards get punished too much in this game in my opinion theres too many punishment you want talk about bps scoring system thats everyones favorite topic right all right so i think end the stream all right so i think that i had one final question for you guys which was we talked a little bit about lewis we talked a little bit about vardal a little bit about foden are there any other because the southender match is a fantastic match are there any other possible fantasy assets on man city i know they the champions league as a factor and then but lets say that we get a predictable champions league 11 is there is there anybody i think youve named plenty thats all we need okay like theres like because like there could be defenders or is there any edge in any or any or even other defenders like im just curious is there any edge to be g picking someone off the table vodin is the choice and hes not a choice youll talk yourself into getting bernardo silva or doku and these are these are paths to pain youre right all right so there we are and i think thats it i think we can wrap this up guys yes and thanks everyone for listening i gotta i gotta pull up my running order again this is weve never done a more chaotic pod

we're back I feel like I still have an international break like breathing down my neck well I can't we're back for four weeks only limited time only yeah I know but it feels like I'm like oh [ __ ] is it next oh no no is it two weeks oh no no oh [ __ ] it's three weeks it's right there it's right there yeah yeah it's always right there isn't it what's up with you dude I'm chilling dog Met's lost yeah sad all day stinky yeah I was too big busy at work with work today to be able to watch my [ __ ] dumbass team still not have won a game this season Crystal pal November Crystal Palace FC football club [ __ ] and so I was very pleased to have been saved that torment I don't know if I could have taken a nil nil one loss if I actually watched the whole [ __ ] game so that was uh felt like I was uh like you know cast aside I don't I I actually agree yeah I don't think you would have been able to handle that game and you guys are a [ __ ] mess and glasner is yeah maybe out I don't know I don't all right all right all right don't need to speculate on that yeah yeah what about you over on your side of the yeah you know saying that'ss I I I went into Sunday thinking wow imagine if Liverpool win in the morning Mets win Jets win ah one for three yeah you know if you if you hit one for three you go to the Baseball Hall of Fame so you know in some some sense that's good you know what's cool is I know that you're on a a pretty nice red arrow I'm on a small pretty nice I doubled my rank I'm on a small green arrow but we have the exact same number of points in the exact same rank we didn't get there the same way this week though come on that's cool though I've used all my chips I don't the chips over there I'm not [ __ ] competing it's nice it's nice it's but we're just aligned you know yeah we're on the same same page same point same page same page let's look at team W 32 points one game gave me my points I just the the tilting of Holland like bringing him in after game wi five and just Captain blank Captain blank Captain blank [ __ ] [ __ ] it's hard that's been really hard for me over the last uh I mean I guess it's over a month since there's an international break every two weeks but um that's been very difficult to stomach for we just we'll just say that but my villa guys were the only returns it's just you know dib God seems to di God for those the uninitiated is Tyler dibling I didn't realize that he just gets a yellow card every game definitely do without that he's just caught out of position and does some petulant [ __ ] every game cuz he's [ __ ] child kid yeah and uh he just has a boner at all times I imagine because that's what we were all doing at 18 but yeah yeah everyone's bad everything was bad Saka didn't play kill me apparently did you see all the cartel [ __ ] on Discord are you privy to that I saw a little bit of the chat on Discord but I mean obviously I'm not on Twitter and I don't really understand or know who the actors are I didn't know until just now cuz a bunch of people were asking questions that with the word cartel in it and I was like [ __ ] are you guys talking about like stop and so Ron said it was a thing on Twitter at deadline tons of content creators advised all week to hold Saka but last minute they transfer Saka son there are accusations of Insider info and [ __ ] [ __ ] off I don't know I'm having a hard I I I can feel myself wanting to get worked up over this oh yeah oh yeah and also it's just like I don't care I can't care I don't know like are people just sitting there with these big text things and being like yeah what's that like who's what's happening like this guy that guy and I think there's probably a WhatsApp group and they that's probably exactly what's happening and [ __ ] it's like a [ __ ] they they have like a grand M they're like a cult and there's got to be some cult leader and he sent beams out the signal Saka to son everyone panics one second before the deadline does the move and you know gains plus seven or whatever the [ __ ] but who cares dude [ __ ] who cares it's just like if you're watching or paying attention to what you know these alleged content creators of which whom I suppose were I mean both of us hold Saka like just don't know what's happen easy easy he's obviously playing but like I just I can't be [ __ ] to follow some type of timeline of you know they're advocating X Y and Z and I mean I can understand the the disingenuousness if they're dealing with hidden information and then they have close contacts who are asking them to keep themselves secret and they're winning money leagues because of it like well it's I mean it's Five Points here six points there is one thing but I think it's just the nature of like who are you trusting and what's happening and um I mean I could imagine that feeling bad and also at the same time it's like this game is [ __ ] ridiculously stupid and they make up what the rules are as we've been saying for years week to week as they go along yeah and some got an assist and then you got take away and I I mean that that we can I'm sure we'll get on to later but yeah just stupid you know I mean it's a stupid game content creators like we're all [ __ ] idiots we don't know anything it's just you're obviously just subscribed to the wrong podcast join us at FML we have no hidden information no secret contacts no WhatsApp groups we just [ __ ] play the game yeah play it as it lies we hold dibling we start soccer with confidence we go for how about you over there with your fly FL Everton related [ __ ] 45 points that's how bad a [ __ ] week it was 45 feels like [ __ ] flying yeah yeah [ __ ] for and meleno dude is they came they're coming in for you big time the true Joy isn't just that I got a meleno 7po auto sub it's that I had my bench order correct because there are a bunch of people on our Discord who had s meno first on their bench and I was like that's on you we have very few actual manager decisions to make in this goddamn game and that's one of them and I'm so happy I got it right because I got the minko seven pointer yeah pick for I'm glad you didn't ask me because I would have said definitely seeno over Michael Eno okay dangerous yeah well you told me he missing big chances on red card for an hour and a half for fun so that's maybe prash but yeah yeah yeah I mean Sanu got a big chance he got he got his one big chance um I brought in foden and Archer didn't get rid of Saka got rid of shot Ali Ali instead so I I I barely barely came out positive there yeah I mean I just knew I wanted to get rid of OI out of my I guess no one heard or a lot of people didn't hear the patreon pop but it was more like who am I GNA want to get rid of the most as I move towards probably you know two premium midfielders with Holland but that might all blow up because Holland might be the worst pick in the game but that aside I knew oi was probably first on my kill list so I just wanted to do that while holding Saka in a good fixture jokes on me doesn't even [ __ ] play and then I'll you know wait till this week when arsenal of Liverpool to you know pick my other premium is is kind of why I did that but Archer NP pointer [ __ ] genius move amazing great pick great pick yeah amazing and somehow Roger shot wasn't an unle but we take those I don't know what the [ __ ] the rules are I don't I mean those ones when they take the shot from that far away you can't like what are you going to get some [ __ ] physicist to draw some like it's like a splatter bloodline or something you I mean as you said it's made up I mean it's lit like the the rule is obviously stupid because that just it's obviously an own goal by any sense of logic like the ball doesn't go in the net unless it hits bass's fat [ __ ] ass therefore it should be an Ole but I don't [ __ ] care I got the points um October mug Le leaders one more game we to go this is from F game we because I don't know if the game's updated yet probably not they're probably still adding an assist Alex Parry AKA wack FC in First Sea Whittle AKA gardy always on time and in third Kyle Shepard AKA post thought XG love that shout out to the public league leader Seth Stillman AKA Felix FC dude where are we going where aren't we going this is going to be a long one that's all I can say I think we should start with Manchester City the Champions sure the gold badged frauds so were a few games since the rogery injury yep they can't create a big [ __ ] chance they're losing an XG they cross 40 plus times a game and do [ __ ] nothing and play for Corners yep what the [ __ ] are we doing here I mean it just feels insane I don't know I don't know yeah I mean it's a multi-layered question because you know everyone has Holland obviously and then everyone has pretty much everyone has at least one Defender yeah leis or Gard most people yeah so I mean let's start with the Holland you know $15 million question I guess yeah let's start with Holland jitb said is it better to roll this week to maximize potentially shipping out Holland in 10 because everyone should know they're home Southampton and nine so we're not getting rid of this week and then ethical said any doubts creeping in about Holland after Southampton 15.2 buys a lot of stuff in the squad so yeah I'm very much thinking about it I mean yeah it's it's weird with Holland because I think that the reputation that he has especially like this season last season is like he just gets the final shot and he's so good at finishing so all he does is score goals and he never touches the ball otherwise but when he was on Dortmund he was like incredible at many things not just shooting so good in buildup so good on the break so good at all the time yeah but pep has constructed this [ __ ] house of cards this delicate balance of this that you don't do that in this system partially because I think they get no transition opportunities ever against anyone well also it conserves his energy it conserves his energy keeps him fit which was always a problem yeah and now we're just looking at this team where I'm just like I never expect him to score he's bad in the air I know he's big but he's bad in the air he's bad at headers and all they [ __ ] do is get it to one of their goddamn dribbly Wingers and [ __ ] cross and then the cross gets headed out by some [ __ ] Dawson and they take a corner like they're bad right now they're worse than they've been for years right now it's you can't argue against that like the last few games are I think probably the worst three game I could maybe Mis misremembering some of the Roder outs periods that they've had over the last handle years but the last three games from City are about as bad as you could possibly imagine them of looking in I mean I think it was like it was interesting the minute Gish came on he stopped like I mean Goku I don't want to upset you off please go off I mean we're getting we're getting Pak Jus Naas here I mean he's gonna be in Spain playing fullback in five the minute that guish came on and realize like oh let me float these crosses to the back post instead of just Spam them into the guy immediately in front of me to win a corner they were like all they were kill like for those 15 10 minutes it was like oh they're [ __ ] scrambling like wolves don't know what to do yeah and they were like some late Runners and like so that was one thing I just noticed but you know I mean dku and Savia were just carbon copies of each other who just do a lot really good middle third build up you know foul blah blah blah but when they get the ball to feed at the final third there's just no movement there's no onew passing in the middle of the area at the top of the box like lamina just shut them down down and you know [ __ ] gundo looks beyond wased he's just so slow he's just so slow like it's not even like his body but almost like his mind as well he's just he seems like he's moving at half speed and B also just was just kind of pedestrian and kovich you know he his his weaknesses were being exploited just not moving the ball fast enough and they just keep getting the ball to reuban at the top of the box and you know no one they're just and they they just didn't they could just didn't do anything I mean we've seen this game reminded me there was a Southampton game that they played against maybe like three years ago where they won one nil at the death on some cross and I think they put in like 40 crosses in this game I don't know if you remember that that game like a couple years ago I no I can't really remember it yeah but I mean you know they've had this in their locker but you know you're talking about the rogery aspect from from certainly that's an issue but you know the Kevin aspect was also what we've been talking about and you know him missing the last four games and like it looks like he picked something else some some new thing up after he trained for one day um so it's like I have I'm I'm like of two minds where it's you know we see these last few games and you know you don't not only not want Holland who's 15 million but you don't want a city player you don't [ __ ] anyone yeah and then also the thing that we talk about all the time is they have worldclass players and the best manager in the world so they're not going to just keep doing this like they're gonna obviously improve and start scoring again because they're gonna either win the league or finish like second so I don't know like you know I'm I'm conflicted in that sense of like yes Holland looks really bad and yeah redistributing him to get an extra premium feels genius but then I also look at it and I'm just like are we back to trying to play the game on hard mode by taking a three sample size game period And extrapolating it over the next 30 thinking like oh he's bad like he's not bad he's not bad yeah it's just it's just like a [ __ ] ridiculous thing I don't know what to make of it it's like I mean I think part of it is also just like you like the reality of the Premier League right you have no time ever to train especially if you're in Champions League you have one day a week Max to train and all you have time for is like let's prepare for the next opponent you can't like adapt and what happened when they lost Kevin and Roger at the same time is just all of their passing is out of the team they're two best midfielders by a long long [ __ ] range but also just the type of midfielders that they don't have to replace because like kova is good we like kova you know foden's good we like him you know savos look good every game but they're all Rico is good they're all just like dribbly boys and no one can pass and like like you were saying they just recycle possession recycle how many times because I I went back and watched the second half how many times they get it to kovic who I 50 times and all he does is try and win a foul yeah he just tries to like up up trick trick you hopeful wolves guy sticks his foot and win a foul and then they get a free kick from 25 yards great and [ __ ] guess who's not scoring if all they get is Corners in 25 yardage is [ __ ] Holland so yeah like you said obviously I agree Pep's gonna think of something because he's [ __ ] great but right now it's just like [ __ ] get out of here like get out of town um it's just hard to it's hard to imagine you know they're just going to turn it turn it on at a nowhere and just like starts creating huge chances everywhere yeah I mean I think it's also Ian you know I didn't have Holland for very long last year I was obviously did it very badly at the game as I usually do but I didn't have Holland for a really long time and it really just felt like paddling Upstream the whole time yeah because you know he you we we were accurately not captaining him in the away games and the non-home bankers and I mean he did have that the away Wolves game actually ironically last year was when he had you know five returns I think yeah they had two pens and and I was yeah that was really fun for me not having him in that game but um like if you're looking at his run after the Southampton game this week which you know I do want to actually talk about as like is he the best captaincy option but looking past that you know they don't have a really good home banker against a bad team I I don't know if Everton is bad I mean they they tend to fall apart against the good teams but I mean that's game make 18 and you know that's like we're looking at almost 20 we're almost like 2025 I mean their home games after Southampton are are Spurs NFL man united Everton you know a lot of aways in there um and then you know they have West Ham 20 at home and then you know some aways so I don't know I mean it's like I think you need to kind of commit and look see you know am I happy to you know may be Captain this week against Southampton and then hold and not cap for a while unless if things change or get rid you know which I mean either way you can make very cogent arguments I think against for for for other cases right and I'm very much leaning right now towards getrid I mean like you were saying like Everton normally I'm like Oh They'll score five you know pep D that's what happens every year imagine imagine IM ining them crossing 45 times against Everton just like I can't watch that I can't Captain a guy in that game because TCO and bran just heading balls out all day like that's DA's dream as you crossed [Music] that so I just I looked it up while you're were talking so how many times is Man City under pep crossed 40 or more times and it's 12 times that's crazy in like should be like three 400 games or something it should be less than that I mean that's very little you know like I I don't I haven't like looked specifically into these matches like maybe there's red cards or weird [ __ ] but the results are horrendous when they do I mean they have two wins in these 12 games so like some it's almost a clear indication that something is just very very f broken if this ever happens yeah and it's happened twice you it just happened and oh no it didn't happen again this season but like you know the other games were just as bad it feels like it's happening it feels like it's happening all the time so so you're you're more leaning towards getting right after Southampton and just spreading it around more yeah I think so yeah which you know obviously I used two of my four free to get him fed and now I'm just like I I do feel a little bit but like ah God I wish I just had my freeze because like yeah I maybe would have kept olly you know like that's some you know like I I don't you don't need any money if you're ever getting rid of Holland so but I you know figure it out I don't know I'm I'm leaning towards holding him um okay I just holding and not capping yeah holding and not because I feel like I can do I feel like I can do that fine in a fine way and not like forsake too much um you know just by spreading it around because I think you know you have your your two mids that you need or whoever to to have the like whether it's sun or Mo or or Palm God or Saka or whatever like you know I mean it's not like we're we're spreading this around from so many players and I just feel like it just changes so fast right like we literally after the Arsenal game in game week five we're like all the the entire preseason everything we learned from last year we're sitting here like never Captain him in away games only Captain them in home bankers and after five games of watching them destroy everyone and him do all the things all the time at Newcastle Home full of at wolves you know two away games two one medium home game and he just blinks them all and now we're talking about getting rid of him and I just like a really good point I can't [ __ ] oscillate from extreme to extreme and ahead and I'm just like I don't know you know he's good they'll win a pen periodically yeah right like I just he's just like bumo now he's just yeah I'm just like [ __ ] forget him like maybe they play well against Bournemouth and Brighton and I'm like oh game M 12 home Spurs I'll just like I'll just Captain him because things change in three weeks or it's after the international break and he's I don't [ __ ] knowbe vodin will change things you know maybe you know cuz I can't imagine it's so Savio and doku and like that would that would blow my mind yeah so it's got to be like Jack and foden and maybe you know another Midfield try or something I think that's a really good point because like you said and this was totally a preseason note of mine is like when team when things aren't going well you should expect the manager and players to make changes and when things are going well you should expect the opposite so you know what are we doing Southampton though I mean so you're thinking not capting because said what three City players should we have for their upcoming demolition to Southampton and ethical said do we get foden for Southampton I it's still the best fixture in the league home IP switch isn't far away IP switch have fallen off the [ __ ] whatever they were on they look really bad now no Greaves who plays them bumo you're really going to cap buo over Holland I just said they're the same player I'm think about it I mean I I am actually thinking about it and hopefully bu just put everyone off the scent because he was so bad at man united maybe yeah last time I C booma I worked pretty [ __ ] good home South home Southampton for city is like you know you expect them to just give them goals for fun but also I'm just like I don't they do yeah I I think it's it's just it's a consideration I think you still probably are supposed to in Holland but you know they play midweek we'll see what happens we we'll revisit at the end of the week but I also wanted to come back around on on City the defense I mean dude we got to talk about the defense we have to talk about the defense like you know look vard [ __ ] bangs a off foot top bins worldy which is an actual laugh Riot joke that that even happened but it's a joke but also like at what point are we like he's just a donger like I him not scoring five plus goals a year at this point I'm just like he's gonna yeah no that's fine you know that's fine G he'll score his few goals a year but the defense is ridiculous it's just so bad I mean they have one this year through eight and they've had many very easy many easy games yeah yeah it's the thing that's insane about watching them play is like their like XG whatever isn't that high but they're not like letting up low XG chances in accumulation it's like it's not that high and there there's like a few enormous chances that make the the low number overall and I just feel like every time I watch them it's like without Roger like they just either the backline drops off or someone falls asleep or someone cuts in behind or yeah and it's just like it's a matter of when it's like they let up between two and four absolute gigantic chances every single game and they're letting up the least amount of shots per game and and the second highest quality chances per shot to to switch Yeah that doesn't work they're coning they're just getting [ __ ] run right down the gut by whoever the fastest player is on the other team doesn't matter who saato or Adama or whoever the [ __ ] yeah and yeah it happens multiple times it's so easy I feel like for these teams to play against them which yeah without R it's yeah without Roger and like the and you know not having Walker there for the recover pace which you know makes up for a lot I mean they have [ __ ] Ruban still somehow the year 2024 he still [ __ ] plays every game he can't move and Stones is still playing in the backline just [ __ ] put him at striker godamn play him up in the box but like even if it's a kanji or stone I mean it doesn't [ __ ] matter there's just no Pace in the backline and you know Rico's just like a little small guy and even when he he has some Pace but he just get Shug off the ball by any [ __ ] player so yeah I mean they're they're just a mess and like I vardal look I got it you know we were talking about it a couple weeks ago the fixtures and but he's just not a good pick like I get the dong or whatever like I don't care like the way you watch this team and you're not spending six million on a on a Defender period you're just gonna be lucking into points if he keeps doing this it just there's no sustainability and Rico like we talk about Rico's always good compared to the other four FS well he's still taking up the spot on your team he's still getting no points and maybe he's not like maybe he's not yeah cuz he just doesn't do anything like he does and also like it's the same right it's it works the same as I just said with Holland and it works negatively for the defense right if something is not working you should expect it to change so like yeah he started three in a row great they've been [ __ ] awful in every game and conceded in every game and are lucky he been a big reason why and they're very lucky to seven points very lucky and he could get dropped he probably will get dropped like just waiting for Kyle or gonna put a kanji back at right back or Stones back at right back he's gonna try stuff to fix it yeah and you know I mean it's just he's so lightweight like I mean I've been watching him very closely in the last handful of games and he just he's annoying to watch really hard to watch I mean he they he changed his role in the second half he was playing a lot more deep in the first half but like he just he just goes into this little half space on the right mid right Striker eight fre eight side whatever yeah he just doesn't do anything he just stands there he comes he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass I mean he he maybe you know he'll make a couple of maybe forward passes but broadly speaking he just doesn't shoot he doesn't create anything he just doesn't do anything and you know I don't really care what his price is I think he's just a bad pick and they're not keeping clean so yeah you know he's been really frustrating and I think I'm I'm like past my my boiling point with him I think after Southampton um I mean if he starts midweek I might get rid of him but I'm I'm I'm I'm very concerned about him and and very concerned about the defense at large and especially because you know Roger's Roger didn't you know strain his hamstring he's out for the year out for the season so why are there why is there clean sheeter defense prospects going to improve they're not going tole that goes back to the pep thing right it's like clearly whatever they've done to address the rogery Kevin double injury has not worked attacking or defending eventually they're going to put up some good performances keep a string of cleans win a bunch of games I think they'll get it right but until then yeah he's just a bad pick F's a bad pick ederson's a bad pick but do you think that that that he's gonna start start dropping off and playing cuz to me when I look at the squad and the players they have available what they should be doing is playing deeper and coning possession more and trying to get Holland in space and trying to break that's they haven't played that way since Pep's been there like what's he gonna do like I I yeah I I don't really know what he's going to do I mean make one of the midfielders stay deeper make bilva be the deepest midfielder he's done that before I mean relying on like gundo and kovic like it's eight years ago and they're going to cover all this ground and win the ball and yeah it's just not realistic at all I think that like as much as he loves gundo like a son he's just gonna watch the tape of the games and just be like good God you know this is not working at all um all right I honestly stones in Midfield is like not yeah yeah I I don't know why he hasn't something like that like you know could do that could do that yeah okay City's a mess City's a mess somehow they have all these Point how are you feeling with Rico I mean you have Rico as well yeah I mean he stinks um most defenses stink yeah I mean we we did get questions on that I mean J Phoenix said who are the best defenders Calli said I have Trent and poro both seem like problems what Defenders are actually good right now which you know is we can go towards Liverpool we can go towards Arsenal with the discussion we can talk about Spurs but like which defense is actually good right now is a real question and it's really hard to answer I mean List Liverpool NF Liverpool's great the hardest pictures in the league I think nfo also is very easy you know like Nuno team playing well there's no reason to not trust them to just keep some cleans they keep keeping cleans um they're good but there's very few teams very few teams that I really really trust I want to say that I do still trust Arsenal I really do these red cards are [ __ ] dumb and Etta teams for some reason get way more red cards than everyone else but do you feel the same way or are you like kind of wavering With Your Arsenal guys the missing Personnel is starting to really compound for me like you know I mean odard missing is something we almost have as like not even uh it's it happened so long ago that we don't even really realize it but he is the most important player like he does everything for them getting going forward space Pace intelligence like he just does so much for them that every injury past him I feel like it's like it makes such a huge amount of difference and um like they're just players are just trying to do too much almost right where you know everyone is trying to play like an extra an extra gear and then they look just like an extra gear worse because of that almost yeah you know I mean Saka misses a game and the defense has just been I trust the defense from a a systemic standpoint of like how he has them set up and the control he's trying to Output influence but dude they they like haven't played with the same back line I think twice all year almost if you like like they yeah it's I mean white back which is nice but yeah but but like now like Gabrielle's played all the games right I mean he started every game other than that it's like white Timber CBA calori zenko played like it's just yeah I think Gabrielle and CBA have started every game obviously celba just got the red but yeah white just came back Timber now is her Cal Fury started starting but he's played I think both on the left and the right or has he just played on the left I can't remember yeah yeah yeah exactly but but yeah but then it's it's that compounded with like where's Rice playing where's Tom playing is is George Marino yeah Marino is new he doesn't know what the [ __ ] going on and it's just all of a sudden he played Kai in Midfield a game or two here or there right and all of a sudden it's just like all of the it's just so many moving parts and yeah the thing that made them grind everyone else to dust last year to me was he played the same 11 all year like every game he had every like 3,000 minutes from like nine players or whatever and everyone just did the same [ __ ] thing and it was Unstoppable and now you know they have a fixture pile up and they have injuries and yeah I mean I'm not like that confident I still I still like them a lot but you're also paying an absolute up the- noose premium on them right yeah yeah yeah I mean barck said do we sell our Arsenal defense especially if we're doubled up no cleans in the last three pretty disappointing next three don't Inspire much confidence and Jeff said if you have double Arsenal D are sick of it do you dump Rya for pford or Gabrielle for Lewis well forget about [ __ ] Lewis we we but I I just feel like that's also insane like to to get rid it just feels crazy to me right yeah I'm I'm right there with you it's it's it is crazy and these red cards I mean someone posted in our Discord like they have way more red cards than any other team since artetta got there so like I don't know whatever he's injecting them with before the game it's too much he needs to dial it back the aggression and the stupidity but they're not going to keep getting Reds you know it's it's literally not possible and they do still have cleans well I mean it's also like the Southampton leester concessions are nonsense right I mean they were they were not both all three of those goals were absolute ridiculous banana and nonsense goals so you know they were in complete control there and if they kept one clean in those two games let's not even say both right you're sitting here and you're saying like oh yeah they're just you know they have four cleans in eight and you know but it's just you know that with three red cards you know with three red cards yeah like and you know look they do have tough fixtures upcoming they have Liverpool Newcastle Chelsea pressure makes diamonds like they are good at cleaning tough games because they have to be on it and they're not complacent and you know Gabrielle's [ __ ] sticking his finger up the enemy's bum holes right you have to you have to so I don't care that much about that I just feel like if you have them you hold them and if you're looking to make money I guess but also it's just like like for who like I would like to see that team but I think it all goes back to the overall belief that both of us have which is just like I don't want to touch my keeper I don't even want to touch my Defenders there's too many high upside premium attackers who are [ __ ] amazing getting quadruple returns and like that's where I want to use my transfers my biggest problem is never Gabrielle or Rya you know like they're just going to get cleans and get points like don't [ __ ] care yeah um but I I I do think Liverpool maybe are are are leap frogging them for for best defense in the league honestly after watching the Chelsea game yeah I mean they're the Chelsea game if anything like confirmed that we should believe in the defense cuz like they just are like you can have the ball as much as you [ __ ] want we're not going to we're not going to get baited by this press ever and we're not we're not doing anything risky we're just going to stay in shape and you're going to do nothing and they basically can see the one Nico chance and he does a good finish and can yeah you could look at that and and interpret it any way you want second second clean sheet can canate has given up of the season but they're great yeah if you concede one chance that's good yeah um we'll get to Liverpool for the the other two Arsenal questions I mean Vikings said Kai do we sell or hold Arsenal playing a lot with 10 men fixtures about to get tough who are the good replacements and then golf said does Arsenal have a stench who stenching it's not stench levels come on we gota we got to relax with that there's still maybe best team in the league like they're still so good but yeah it's just been a [ __ ] up start to the season yeah I don't know I mean where what are you feeling about with Kai he's eight3 right now um he has four goals one assist through eight where where you at yeah I think it's a I think it's a transfer out I mean I don't think it's a [ __ ] emergency you're insane if you transfer him out he's a really good player he's going to get returns but do I want him in home Liverpool at Newcastle at Chelsea home nfo like the answer is no I don't want him at all in those um especially if Saka is out we know OD guard's still out but Saka to me Saka is by far their most important player and if he's out they just have [ __ ] nothing I mean relying on like trossard to make the killer pass and Marino to do stuff in the Box I'm like get out of here um yeah Martinelli yeah Martinelli [ __ ] off um so well they play midweek so we'll have a better idea we'll have a better idea after champions league but yeah for me for me it's a transfer out I mean gaming 13 talk to me about Kai talk to me about Saka you know we I I'll be interested again you know I'll be back but that's exactly what I was just trying to say about the Defenders is like I want to use my transfers here because I see I could move to someone get more points more goals or double change and make him at a premium mid maybe a captaincy option if we're not Captain Holland Etc so yep that's where I want to go um yeah Fair yeah as for which forwards I mean Chris Wood is isn't it so obvious God it just is it's just so ridiculously for for the next four if you don't include you know gameing 12 when when they play City I mean I mean when they play Arsenal I mean you [Music] just you start him in the in gimick 9 10 11 13 with a lot of confidence I mean he could have braced today easily he has pens I mean he's [ __ ] great I don't know what to say yeah yeah yeah I mean I mean it does feel very much overthinking to not have what at this point is insane is it I mean if you told me this two years ago like you're going to be doing this podcast in two years it's gonna be like December November and you're gonna be saying Chris Wood is one of the most obvious fors in the game like you're [ __ ] transfer Your Arsenal for to Chris Wood yeah you're insane but yeah it's close I mean I all of a sudden they're just like the forwards there are all these budget forward options putting their hats in the rank and there then that's it yeah wiissa strand COA like Jim yeah Jim yeah I forgot about Jim yeah we got questions about these guys too I mean I basically all of the above I mean would you rather buy Dom or Jim or wood thoughts on cheap forward Shan Larson versus Jim versus wiissa I mean do you have big preferences on these because Jim also his form is just unbelievable yeah I mean it was a little bit of a weird one where you got the you know goal kick assisted goal and you know he had another little half chance here there but um I mean I think Wiis is the best of the of the bunch honestly I mean just looking at the fixtures and looking at you know the player home IP switch at Fulham homeborn with at Everton home Lester I mean easily the best pictures of all the the pretty good he's 5'9 and you know he's done it before and you know I I think that the player is good um you know Bren Hammer a little bit mix bag and but they're getting they're getting fitter and you know the NPCs are NPC so I like WIA the most um I like that I like that yeah I mean I I think strand is probably second because this fixture runs just longer I mean basically my thing with wood that I'm a little bit uncertain of how to handle is like you want to transfer out yeah you're GNA want to transfer him out soon because the Run gets really bad really fast so like if you don't already own him are you buying him over these plays I'm just not yeah because again it's similar to a Defender right you don't want to use your transfers on the spot right right it's at Lester home Western Home Newcastle at Arsenal home iip switch then it gets really bad at City at United Home Villa at Brenham Spurs Everton W you know Liverpool so um so you know really after the next I mean you're looking at the next five and you know you probably have two and a half good ones Arsenal's really bad and then you know what they're going to lay an egg in one or two of them but um yeah I don't know I just I feel like he's he's all of a sudden like just going lower and lower on the the power ranking yeah I mean as his run declines it's like yeah the the length of his run it you know impacts the quality of the pick a lot I think um yeah I really rate Tran Larson um just like pure ey test I just think he does a lot of really good stuff and I honestly don't think wolves are that bad I know that they have no wins bottom of the table all the [ __ ] and you know they have the hardest ever imaginable schedule so far yeah and I just think they're very I'm not saying they're good but I just think they're like okay like they're whatever they have some guys they can move the ball into the final third they can cross the ball and I just think you know he just played against literally every best team in the league League like the the top five at least and you know he doesn't have to play against them anymore I mean he is for his one and two he's [ __ ] one and two yeah yeah so I think he's great he's the cheapest of this group I think now yeah he's 55 yeah long-term hold like you said I mean you don't want to use a transfer on this spot and you will not use a transfer on this spot until you know maybe gameweek 19 or something like that with Trent Larsson so yeah that's as good as you can get I think yeah um even though he doesn't have pens you know still still good and which would does have you know I mean it's because interesting would and D have that yeah yeah well DCL is something else but I mean that's also like looking at wood and wiissa because they kind of have like a similar convergence of like they have the next few good fixtures and then it gets bad and like yeah I don't know I mean wiissa not having pens versus what having pens it's it does make a big difference and then it's it's almost like you going to just are you resigned to make a transfer in in December on the player or or not or is this a rotation and you know you kind of have to look at your team and think about like how am I seeing the season how am I going to play how am I when's the I think what you have to do planning wise is like when is the next time I want to rotate out my premiums like when is the next Triple Three transfer week because that very much impacts if you want someone who's good for four game we or if you want someone who's good for 11 game weeks right right right totally like I'm on three free now I'm sure I'm going to use at least two this week I think you know assuming like Saka is hurt I'll probably get rid of Kai I'll move to a premium mid whatever but I'm going to want those Arsenal guys back I think you know game we 13ish or something like that 13 14 just for you know a pretty long good run of p and I still like them both a lot so I can't think of it as like oh I'll just get wood and then I'll move him to [ __ ] strand Larson and then I'll move him to blah blah blah it's like no I I already booked all these transfers like I'm getting the Arsenal guys I don't I have no freeze is like how I should be looking at it yeah yeah and I mean CA is also there 65 like he's yeah I mean he's who we presumably believe to be on pens for wolves is that correct yeah I think so as I mean cabia doesn't play anymore he doesn't play anymore yeah so I mean he's also a pick there right but yeah yeah I guess it's also just like where is The Meta moving like do we want to have I mean we haven't mentioned salanki 77 talk about him and Spurs or yeah but just just just a note on this like how many it seems like everyone should have at least one sheep forward like but should it be two yeah the correct two or something like that is is that the best now five mids maybe yeah maybe yeah but I mean because it also in the back of my mind like watching ESO I'm just like oh I'm gonna want to get him soon he should have braced he should have braced yeah he should red and you know this is they play Chelsea and Arsenal and then NFL away which isn't we thought would be good but is not and then they have a pretty good run forever so I'm just like also looking at that like well every he was in 60% of teams in game this is the guy dude didn't I say this is the [ __ ] we learned our lesson with Rich last year and we're going to forget about him guy yeah and he's gonna like they don't have a slam dunk run of fixtures at any point really yeah they have like just enough to splice it up to make it look not so good but like he goes back to one of those where he plays once a week I don't know if calum's going to be back at some point and you know maybe he's wing and then yeah I mean who knows but like he's playing once a week and has pens and they're looking competent again and everyone's getting fit again so like he's also some like well I kind of want to get him soon and like if I go down to all these six million forwards like what am I doing yeah so it's and also like if isach is who everyone thought he was at the beginning of this season everyone knows he was at the end of last season I don't give a [ __ ] if they have two hard fixtures in 10 or whatever you know like he could score in [ __ ] anyway he was Unreal last year so you know it doesn't even matter I like that shout a lot yeah I mean starting in 12 this incredible run incredible run I mean basically it's just they're only definitely hard one is home Liverpool and even even that at least it's at home yeah the rest are good till [ __ ] March February whatever really good so I love that shout I love that shout and they honestly played really well against Brighton yeah yeah they should have won the game for sure yeah um you have Spurs stuff because you watch that match I'm only living on Highlights but I mean to get four goals with no BJ involvement no Dom involvement you know the the [ __ ] fluky own goal assist then is taken away I mean weird weird goals and weird game yes it was a weird game weird goals um it's just so much more down to Western being so diabolical to me than than Spurs being actually really good but you know I mean Spurs probably you know they could have scored six yeah you would have been would have been chance that he hit off the inside of the post yeah yeah and they they let the foot off the gas for the last half hour like they stop kind of stopped playing but um you know subing mat early was very interesting one there subbing him at half um it's it's just you know they just attack so much right they just relentlessly attack and they barely play any Defenders and the Defenders that they do play are all all really fast and play at the halfway line so dogs is in the Box the whole highlight the whole highlights he was in the Box yeah and por shooting from distance like it was either one or the other doing that so um yeah I mean sun was like also just very pedestrian to me like as as I I used to seeing him be um where it just you know against a good defense he just blanked easily comfortably blanked uh you know and against West Ham it's just like he looks like a a world beater where you know his shots that we've been watching him just get blocked all season are just like going through or or whatever and ariol had a really bad game yeah arol is he's [ __ ] he's passing to the other team but yeah you just looking at their their fixer run in the Thursday games it's just it's really hard to to ascertain like is this is this a buy is this a is a sell like he's 99 now he just went up today but you know they play home it if switch and 11 which we've been talking about is like a really good captaincy uh game but other than that it's just like you know it's like some good some bad if he's playing on Thursday and they're playing on Sunday it's like you know it's not great you know you're stacking him up against you know all of the other players you know Saka Palmer oi you know foden foden Holland you know I mean you can only have so many of these players so presumably as pens I mean do do do they ever win pens the answer is no so there's a player that's on pens that doesn't win pens on pens I don't know it's like tree falling in the tree falling in the woods if no one's around to hear it but I don't know I'm just still very lukewarm I don't know it's it's very bizarre like I just feel very lukewarm I'm less lukewarm again I'm only on Highlights didn't watch the full game but I do think that like a lot of the West Ham looking diabolical is what Spurs do like that's what their thing is press you win the ball in the third you know make two passes get a shot off whatever I mean they've been scoring a lot of goals lately yeah yeah a lot of goals and I think that like like Fen didn't even [ __ ] start so I don't you know like what what are we even talking about when we're saying like oh foden versus Palmer versus son it's like he doesn't even [ __ ] start and he got a lucky assist at in the 95th minute so I don't even know if he should be in the convo but to me the question is like Palmer in Newcastle man united Arsenal or son in Palace who are a bottom three three or four team right now home Villa ips switch and to me that answerers son yeah it's fair because I mean I don't know what to make fully out of you know the Liverpool Chelsea game was a complicated game but what Liverpool did to Palmer was just like hey guys here's the blueprint I mean if Curtis Jones can just completely Mark him out of the game and score a goal and get an assist but just like yeah I mean Curtis just [ __ ] humiliated him I feel like he just wasn't also could have easily scored a goal like he had a really good no he had that one good chance like that was the best chance that was blocked yeah and yeah I mean he he did nothing otherwise and it was just kind of like okay new Newcastle can do that you know can Manchester United do that like probably not actually like they're just bad but and they have no midfielders that can can run around that much but Arsenal and Newcastle can surely do that like got I don't know I'm just I I kind of want to wait for 12 for Palmer is kind of what I'm getting at here where he will just bully these bad teams and he will get more space and time on the ball and when he will get another quad return or whatever the [ __ ] he's up to you know and yeah I look at these harder games a bit differently after that Liverpool game yeah so Sun yeah Sun's a pick yeah yeah I mean son he's definitely a pick I mean you still just can back back door into the he has pens you know so you have that going for you yeah pens a lot of attacking a lot of shooting yeah sure you know sure you're just trying to find your braces and I think he has a better chance of braces in the next run I mean that a lot of people asked about sun fod and Palmer Saka Etc I mean Jeff D do we prioritize Palmer or Mo or sun to replace s yeah I haven't even talked about Mo um slim said I want to ask you guys do you think it's Mo to Palmer still that's still a move to make no question right um I don't know what what do you think between all these premium mids like who what do you think is the priority what's your priority I think the priority is the fixtures yeah it's just it's all so much of a muchness like you look at Mo as like if he didn't take a pen he just didn't do anything like he created two and no but I mean like oh you create two and a half chances like okay whatever you know maybe you'll get a six-pointer you're not looking at you know the doors are being blown down like oh my God I don't even did he even have a [ __ ] shot like other than that like two shots maybe would be my guess open Play he had yeah he just didn't do anything besides the pen really but um so you know the pen is papering over a lot of cracks I think with the mo the mo argument and it's similarly with sun like if he got the fake assist and you're looking at this like huge double digit Hall where it's like you know whatever you you make you make he also had that that humongous chance that he almost he finishes nine times out of 10 that hit like the inside of the post and bounce across the go line like oh my God yeah that's true that's true but you know I mean I think it's more like you just want to play the medium the the like next four to seven game we fixture run of I'm gonna hold this premium for this period of time and then I'm gonna get this other premium in this spot for this period of time yeah because you you know you can do as much analysis as you want of like which premium player gets Point like Saka is so good in hard fixtures it's like I don't care you know I still want him for the [ __ ] easy ass [ __ ] bad fixtures and I I'd rather have like sun in home Bankers than Salah who performs well in hard fixtures for a hard fixture run you know so it's like every time yeah and I mean like that's where I feel like you want to try and angle yourself towards so that you have the rest so the answer is sun and foden right well foden I think is a little bit stickier because is what the [ __ ] yeah yeah we don't know if he's starting he has no Avenues except for we don't know if City are good we don't know if they're good so that that's Messier but um I think it's probably yeah I mean I think it's just it's just messy like I think we all have Holland I think it's certainly sun with the fixtures in the in the near Horizon and then it's probably like you know Palmer Palmer and 12 yeah or maybe sakade or maybe Palmer now like Watkins I don't know yeah it's I mean you're going to have to take A Couple of bad fixtures on the chin here because if you're looking at just shortterm like next three it's sun and there's no one close for me yeah like between of all the premiums like you know between Liverpool Arsenal Chelsea Villa like it's son yeah after that I think it dovetails nicely with Palmer and that's like immediately where I'll go in 12 no non-negotiable sun could score [ __ ] 500 goals the next three matches and he'll still make the transfer yeah I mean I I think it it's team dependent too there because you know he loves playing that City and I think that's a really good sunf fixture and then home fham at bourem like I think you could hold him past that um I yeah I mean I am sitting here with foden in my team saying I'll transfer him out like maybe's a nightmare foden's probably gonna always be a worst P than Sun unless if he's playing you know Southampton I switch like two or three but uh but I I think it's also you know you look at your your team structure and figure out like what am I doing with my team structure how many how many premium mids you know Holland and no premium forwards or yeah you I'm G have Watkins or Kai or whatever and yeah you know going from there and figuring out like where am I sending my transfers yeah for sure yeah okay um we got some Liverpool questions but mainly just about the defense I mean cink said if you have both which you do uh would you drop Trent or Robo I know Trent's better but is he worth one million more Jitterbug is Trent deard worth using a transfer on when City can clean to save their lives and then Sammy also thoughts on selling Trent obvious Cash Cow when looking add a premium Midfield and pool have really tough run in the next few weeks with their Champions League games blah blah blah um I think I know what you're going to say but what what do you think about that I mean I want to add a third Liverpool Defender I want to get Kate for my leis spot honestly like I do I just do I mean look one one negative for Robbo and Trent this weekend were I mean they just played fullback they were not playing yeah they were not playing Attack attacking positions at all Robo had maybe like a small diance in the second half towards the the end of the game where he was getting forward a couple of overlapping but he was also getting [ __ ] rinsed yeah you know which is I mean he was he was all hands on deck trying to defend and he had help and all that but yeah um but I just still just going back to what we're were talking about earlier is like they played Chelsea who is you know fourth best team in the league yeah top four or other than Liverpool a top three attack in the league yeah and they held them to nothing one chance so yeah I so I mean I look at like look yes they're playing Arsenal in a game that I think could just be non a noname and the just the amount of control that he's trying to influence on the games I just like yeah you know this team I don't really care about the fixtures I just feel like I want as many Defenders as I can get on this [Music] team and I like it so you know so I mean my my near term is like I really want to make Lewis Kate and I want to hold Robo as as little attacking threat as he has like making that transfer to white or or CBA just feels like a [ __ ] waste of time because I yeah voice of free they're very similar and I mean tren's still taking [ __ ] Tren Rob was still taking they had no corners this game somehow I don't know that was a very weird thing they've actually been getting very few corners on the Seas I feel like it's like a directive they don't go to the Bine they don't P crosses they do the opposite Savio and do yeah they just recycle they don't they don't even try to get the corner um I wonder if that's also because it's like they think they're gonna they're more likely to concede off a corner than score on a corner or something yeah I could see that uh but yeah I mean Liverpool defense I just I'm so hard on that like I just feel like that's like the biggest like that's like to me like my biggest Edge play is just like I want Liverpool defense as much as possible I'm very there I mean to me Trent is just still the best aventer in the game even with this insane run I'm still just like man that that Chelsea game was everything for me cuz we had not played a single good team in Europe or the league and then to do that I was just like oh yeah like I I believe now and like Sammy mentioned in in his thing you know obviously they have Arsenal this week they have City and 13 they have a bunch of tough ones in between but like Home Brighton home Villa at Southampton like those are all those are just control the game shut them down type of games so y yeah I'm with you I'm with you there yeah yeah yeah all right let's go to some questions um and you know how I feel about a triple up on a defense hello I mean that just means it's F field baby like f Fields Back yes sir yes sir thank you sir and then your mood 100 depend 100% depends on if that that team cleans or doesn't clean so F that's fun it's chill it's it's good vibes it's good vibes um Lauren said interesting one he said what are your thoughts on a free hit game week nine for teams like mine who don't have Holland or Palmer sort of like alon's free hit 2 plan that never was we know chips are less valuable this season I have three Arsenal and two Liverpool playing each other as well interesting right I it's not insane to me Palmer is not part of the equation for me I really do think that like Newcastle play up to their opponent I mean they played so wellan City Joe Linton Bruno tanali are gonna be up Palmer's ass all [ __ ] game like whatever it's like I think the with Palmer similar to all the other premiums like a return is what you should expect but is it a CR like a cricket score like is that something that can happen and if the answer is no then you're fine to not have that player right yeah exactly but looking at I mean dodging Arsenal versus Liverpool and Liverpool versus Arsenal and like getting on jumping on a bunch of City not having Holland this week feels scary even if with all the negative [ __ ] we just said about Holland I mean you know rammers could just give him a hattrick bednerick and just Southampton players will create the chances for Holland it doesn't matter like they're we know what Russell Martin Rusty Russell Martin's going to do and he's going to All Out attack and try and possess and be the better team and it's going to be a joke I don't love it I but I also don't hate it you hate it yeah I think I hate it I think that you're going to be better placed to use it later when there are blanks like even if it's not these expens used to yeah I don't know I just or something yeah yeah it just it just feels a little short I think the other thing too is you know he's talking about like my Liverpool and um it's gonna be a nil right yeah right like he's not talking Defenders yeah he's not talking about which players he has or how many frees he has but you know it's G to be a stodgy Affair so I mean if you have like Kai Mo and Saka problem yeah maybe we can talk about it a little bit more but like that's where you you just use your freeze there I mean yeah you don't want yeah you don't want soccer with RSL players anyway they have like bad you know so yeah yeah yeah yeah big daddy said what do you guys see with garnacho very happy to asked this question because okay you you go on I I missed this game so I've been yeah I watched this I've been very very high on garnacho I in higher than most United FS I think honestly for like over a year now he under the radar Liam pointed out to me has just started and played 90 for four straight games which was like really the only question mark for him I was like is if he's starting he's a [ __ ] incredible pick he takes 50 shots a game he's an absolute genius little demon I mean he's taken the leap last season he's a [ __ ] star I want him in my team immediately they have great fixtures you know except for Chelsea and 10 he's [ __ ] cheap way underpriced and really great I think everyone should get him that's about that all right over BJ yeah [ __ ] BJ man maybe both but garnacho first make sure in order of you're clicking the buttons you bring in garnacho first if you're bringing six2 yeah 62 I just I I just don't know where you fit him in like who are you forsaking for him I mean Rogers seeno he's better than both of them a lot better seeno A lot better what Cena is good he doesn't take eight shots he doesn't take eight shots a game not yet and he's at Villa home City I mean I don't know Mishka do you believe in regression to the mean or is that an FPL fallacy is Holland destined to Triple return next and Spurs will lose to palet with an a brace and a pen talk to me about regressing to the mean well talk to me about the concept of believing in it or not like it's a [ __ ] religion well isn't it just a a statistical yeah it's just how statistics work I think the confusing part maybe for Mish is what it actually means which is like me too can you teach me yeah well because I think we always joke right like oh VV do like Blah Blah Blah's blanked three in a row they're due to score that's not how it works um you know if Holland were to blank 10 gamings in a row we would not expect him to score oh he's going to score six in one of these games to balance it out what it means is that he'll go back to their normal average rate of scoring aka the mean and therefore it will like a curve back to over time it will curve back to where we expected them to be in the first place it doesn't mean they're just going to make up for everything oh he Holland blank three in a row he's scoring seven this week at Southampton so that it averages out to like oh he shouldn't have blanked three in a row that's not what it means but yeah I mean that that's basically what it means it's just like you should expect them to do put their mean performances whether they're hot you should expect mean performance whether they're cold you should expect a mean performance over time that's all it means cool cool hardly boys so I just put up a week where I had zero returns as in not even a Midfield or clean sheet point I should just quit right yeah not even a midfielder clean couldn't find a four pointer any forward clean banks that was nice when wood wood Bank the clean today I like those like those shots yeah yeah yeah um I can skip some of these Cutler do you want to discuss Everton defense if we have piw should we be doubling up are we in the middle of their run of queens that gets them out of trouble they were never in trouble never in trouble yeah they're great I don't know what to say great team for cleans Good Run Of fixures get them out game week 15 they have wow gameweek 15 I've never seen anything like this they play the four best teams in the league in a row home Liverpool Home Chelsea at Man City what yeah well that's great love it but yeah they're great I don't know what to say doesn't matter if you have Pi don't have Pickford you should get a Defender um speaking of Defenders x50 said brenford haven't kept a clean all season but they've have a good run coming up and pinck and are donging their lives away is there a Defender pick here or are there other cheap Defenders you like more I mean so bad yeah they're just bad like they're a bad team they they attack a bit and there but the spacing is just every game is just very schizophrenic so looking at the four five plays I I just I just get I I guess I'm not sure you know what are you doing with your defense like are are people actually rotating four or five defense fixture plays like I I don't think they're really rotating but I do think that a lot of people have like premium premium and then 145 they're just like starting every week for 10 gamings or something like that I just think that that's misguided like I mean to me it's like I want to have three Defenders that are on good teams like I just I feel like that's the a better way to play this year um just more predictable I mean City being a good team is very subjective but uh um but yeah I mean I I just feel like you're just going to go a lot farther by spending an extra 0. five or million on that spot not having to worry about you know Collins or you know Newcastle like rotation [ __ ] and then someone gets hurt you have to spend another transfer there it's it's just a mess like I think you just get three start every weeks is is kind of where I'm at this year one one little study that someone should do not me is like what percentage of a Defender points come from cleans versus attacking returns yeah versus bonus points and integr because it's probably [ __ ] a very high percent very very high percent prob like 85% or something so the idea of getting a Defender who you don't expect cleans from despite a good run is just ridiculous I mean they need to be [ __ ] Ivanovic like eight goal Marcus a eight goals six assist levels to even consider them and if you're looking at like oh maybe pinck will get me a [ __ ] goal in the next eight game weeks while they keep maybe like one clean it's like that's nowhere near good enough it's not even in the vicinity of good enough you need cleans that's my on that you need cleans you need cleans last question was Giannis he said for non Holland owners which Captain is best bumo Palmer or Rogue foden boo yeah it's got to be bumo It's gotta be bo yeah I think Palmer's fine fine cap um there's not going to be any leaks because there's a Friday game so you can't go fod you just can't do that to yourself think Palmer's fine but I would go boomo yeah yeah yeah like it like the shout like it like it like it okay cool dude yeah we're back F feel's back anything else you want to talk about well I guess Villa we didn't talk about for one second yeah yeah yeah um I you watch this game I watch highlights yeah it was a very strange game very open game um it's it's it just makes me so confused about Oli of like what to do with him I know asset unreal header yeah the header was Unreal and you know he had another chance or two uh that he didn't finish an open Play had a one one-on-one yeah yeah but like they play midweek obviously and it's hard to know what Eon like he subbed him early because he wants to you know not he played 75 whatever he wants to play him in Europe but yeah they have barmouth at home on the weekend and it's going to be their third game of the week and they have Spurs Liverpool Palace Chelsea like I don't I know you just got R and I'm sure a lot of it was because of the the run and you didn't think that looked good for him but yeah what do you what do you see with Oly yeah I'm just it's really hard when a manager gives us different things all the time when like he's said one week he's like we're not even going to attempt to attack Manchester United we're just going to sit on a nil nil and I'm very happy with that and then next week against Fulham he's like I want to play a transitional up and down open space game the whole game and like Ali could have triple returned um and so getting those sort of like inconsistent data points is is hard for me I think to navigate but that said I mean Spurs Liverpool Chelsea coming up like I'm pretty sure I know how he's going to play those and they're all away like he's he's playing for a nil nil in those um and yeah alli's going to start all of them and alli's still great and Alli might be on pens but I just think for n million you're not getting like the bang for your buck there um at least in the short term like I would just rather that be son and then Palmer or just Palmer straight up or yeah yeah but it's certainly not a problem short end the stick certainly not a problem yeah I mean they could they could score three against Bournemouth no problem happens all the time I mean the the home Bournemouth is the one that's like yeah I mean that's where I was like okay I want to just kind of try and see if I can hold on here yeah yeah it's just a good picture for a good team yeah but that's other thing too where I'm like well Bournemouth get to just train and [ __ ] chill all week and they have to play midweek and then play again it's like after they already played Internationals I'm just like oh my God like yeah you they are they GNA come out and just get [ __ ] flat look flat and get kind of battered by a more fys team yeah yeah I'm concerned about I mean you see what pow just did to Jim I'm like oh good luck against [ __ ] seeno like that's a problem for them yeah um yeah I I think he's a good start this week but I think like next five I would just rather spend that money elsewhere yeah and he he's another one that falls in the same boat of like maybe he's 14 you just bring him straight back home Breon yeah what do you see about with Rogers like are you happy to hold to to play him in some of these tougher games because he's so cheap or no not happy you just you just want to bench him yeah I'm not happy with that yeah bench or transfer Venture transfer yeah yeah that's that's what I think about him and like I listen I know he's a very fit young strapping young lad but he's not playing [ __ ] 90 in Europe and 90 in the league All Season no well he's also not possible I mean he's also looked I know he's returned recently but he's looked kind of bad like he looked better in the games he wasn't returning the beginning of the year than he has in like the first four game weeks I think he looked a lot better than he has in the last four game weeks yeah you know he had he had no returns in the first four he has a lot of returns in the last four so he's not playing 5,000 minutes and if he tries like the you know turn and dribble and take on three men against Spurs in game week 10 like he's going to get [ __ ] like they're just GNA press the [ __ ] out of him and win the ball nonstop and same with Liverpool and same with Chelsea you know I I'm not saying he'll complete zero dribbles or something like that but it's just not he needs a rest and like I don't think those games cater to his skills yeah that's fair that's fair yeah Villa tough one so many good picks great it's a great FPL season it's a great F season no it is it is it is and it make it's made better by Towers yeah well if they can just it's it's nice to know they can take away goals or assists at any point while they can do whatever they want they can adjust bonus points tomorrow yeah oh yeah I don't know if it's on I tweeted at them actually before we poed I said are bonus points confirmed yet or goals and assists no response no no response which to me means no they're not confirmed yet so we'll see how it goes let me slap some asses new patreon signups Mark blo Ryan Dale Colin lettuce Austin Burger Arby and the longest Pete get in there baby slap that ass thank you for signing up Walsh any last words I'll see you tomorrow baby I'll see you tomorrow check us [Music] out. sports. sub [Music]",14649,12872,support for this podcast comes from the patrons at patreoncom fmlf okay wel to what are we up to here were back were back i feel like i still have an international break like breathing down my neck well i cant were back for four weeks only limited time only i know but it feels like im like is it next no is it two weeks no its three weeks its right there its right there its always right there isnt it whats up with you dude im chilling dog mets lost sad all day stinky i was too big busy at work with work today to be able to watch my dumbass team still not have won a game this season crystal pal november crystal palace fc football club and so i was very pleased to have been saved that torment i dont know if i could have taken a nil one loss if i watched the whole game so that was felt like i was like cast aside i dont i agree i dont think you would have been able to handle that game and you guys are a mess and glasner is maybe out i dont know i dont all right all right all right dont need to speculate on that what about you over on your side of the saying thatss i went into sunday thinking wow imagine if liverpool win in the morning mets win jets win ah one for three if you if you hit one for three you go to the baseball hall of fame so in some sense thats good whats cool is i know that youre on a pretty nice red arrow im on a small pretty nice i doubled my rank im on a small green arrow but we have the exact same number of points in the exact same rank we didnt get there the same way this week though come on thats cool though ive used all my chips i dont the chips over there im not competing its nice its nice its but were just aligned were on the same page same point same page same page lets look at team w 32 points one game gave me my points i just the tilting of holland like bringing him in after game wi five and just captain blank captain blank captain blank its hard thats been hard for me over the last its over a month since theres an international break every two weeks but thats been very difficult to stomach for we just well just say that but my villa guys were the only returns its just dib god seems to di god for those the uninitiated is tyler dibling i didnt realize that he just gets a yellow card every game definitely do without that hes just caught out of position and does some petulant every game cuz hes child kid and he just has a boner at all times i imagine because thats what we were all doing at 18 but everyones bad everything was bad saka didnt play kill me apparently did you see all the cartel on discord are you privy to that i saw a little bit of the chat on discord but im not on twitter and i dont understand or know who the actors are i didnt know until just now cuz a bunch of people were asking questions that with the word cartel in it and i was like are you guys talking about like stop and so ron said it was a thing on twitter at deadline tons of content creators advised all week to hold saka but last minute they transfer saka son there are accusations of insider info and off i dont know im having a hard i can feel myself wanting to get worked up over this and also its just like i dont care i cant care i dont know like are people just sitting there with these big text things and being like whats that like whos whats happening like this guy that guy and i think theres probably a whatsapp group and they thats probably exactly whats happening and its like a they have like a grand m theyre like a cult and theres got to be some cult leader and he sent beams out the signal saka to son everyone panics one second before the deadline does the move and gains plus seven or whatever the but who cares dude who cares its just like if youre watching or paying attention to what these alleged content creators of which whom were both of us hold saka like just dont know whats happen easy hes playing but like i just i cant be to follow some type of timeline of theyre advocating x y and z and i can understand the disingenuousness if theyre dealing with hidden information and then they have close contacts who are asking them to keep themselves secret and theyre winning money leagues because of it like well its its five points here six points there is one thing but i think its just the nature of like who are you trusting and whats happening and i could imagine that feeling bad and also at the same time its like this game is ridiculously stupid and they make up what the rules are as weve been saying for years week to week as they go along and some got an assist and then you got take away and i that we can im sure well get on to later but just stupid its a stupid game content creators like were all idiots we dont know anything its just youre just subscribed to the wrong podcast join us at fml we have no hidden information no secret contacts no whatsapp groups we just play the game play it as it lies we hold dibling we start soccer with confidence we go for how about you over there with your fly fl everton related 45 points thats how bad a week it was 45 feels like flying for and meleno dude is they came theyre coming in for you big time the true joy isnt just that i got a meleno 7po auto sub its that i had my bench order correct because there are a bunch of people on our discord who had s meno first on their bench and i was like thats on you we have very few actual manager decisions to make in this goddamn game and thats one of them and im so happy i got it right because i got the minko seven pointer pick for im glad you didnt ask me because i would have said definitely seeno over michael eno okay dangerous well you told me he missing big chances on red card for an hour and a half for fun so thats maybe prash but sanu got a big chance he got he got his one big chance i brought in foden and archer didnt get rid of saka got rid of shot ali instead so i barely came out positive there i just knew i wanted to get rid of oi out of my no one heard or a lot of people didnt hear the patreon pop but it was more like who am i gna want to get rid of the most as i move towards probably two premium midfielders with holland but that might all blow up because holland might be the worst pick in the game but that aside i knew oi was probably first on my kill list so i just wanted to do that while holding saka in a good fixture jokes on me doesnt even play and then ill wait till this week when arsenal of liverpool to pick my other premium is why i did that but archer np pointer genius move amazing great pick great pick amazing and somehow roger shot wasnt an unle but we take those i dont know what the the rules are i dont those ones when they take the shot from that far away you cant like what are you going to get some physicist to draw some like its like a splatter bloodline you as you said its made up its lit like the rule is stupid because that just its an own goal by any sense of logic like the ball doesnt go in the net unless it hits basss fat ass therefore it should be an ole but i dont care i got the points october mug le leaders one more game we to go this is from f game we because i dont know if the games updated yet probably not theyre probably still adding an assist alex parry aka wack fc in first sea whittle aka gardy always on time and in third kyle shepard aka post thought xg love that shout out to the public league leader seth stillman aka felix fc dude where are we going where arent we going this is going to be a long one thats all i can say i think we should start with man city the champions sure the gold badged frauds so were a few games since the rogery injury yep they cant create a big chance theyre losing an xg they cross 40 plus times a game and do nothing and play for corners yep what the are we doing here it just feels insane i dont know i dont know its a multilayered question because everyone has holland and then everyone has pretty much everyone has at least one defender leis or gard most people so lets start with the holland 15m question lets start with holland jitb said is it better to roll this week to maximize potentially shipping out holland in 10 because everyone should know theyre home southampton and nine so were not getting rid of this week and then ethical said any doubts creeping in about holland after southampton 152 buys a lot of stuff in the squad so im thinking about it its its weird with holland because i think that the reputation that he has especially like this season last season is like he just gets the final shot and hes so good at finishing so all he does is score goals and he never touches the ball otherwise but when he was on dortmund he was like incredible at many things not just shooting so good in buildup so good on the break so good at all the time but pep has constructed this house of cards this delicate balance of this that you dont do that in this system partially because i think they get no transition opportunities ever against anyone well also it conserves his energy it conserves his energy keeps him fit which was always a problem and now were just looking at this team where im just like i never expect him to score hes bad in the air i know hes big but hes bad in the air hes bad at headers and all they do is get it to one of their goddamn dribbly wingers and cross and then the cross gets headed out by some dawson and they take a corner like theyre bad right now theyre worse than theyve been for years right now its you cant argue against that like the last few games are i think probably the worst three game i could maybe mis misremembering some of the roder outs periods that theyve had over the last handle years but the last three games from city are about as bad as you could possibly imagine them of looking in i think it was like it was interesting the minute gish came on he stopped like goku i dont want to upset you off please go off were getting were getting pak jus naas here hes gonna be in spain playing fullback in five the minute that guish came on and realize like let me float these crosses to the back post instead of just spam them into the guy immediately in front of me to win a corner they were like all they were kill like for those 15 10 minutes it was like theyre scrambling like wolves dont know what to do and they were like some late runners and like so that was one thing i just noticed dku and savia were just carbon copies of each other who just do a lot good middle third build up foul blah but when they get the ball to feed at the final third theres just no movement theres no onew passing in the middle of the area at the top of the box like lamina just shut them down and gundo looks beyond wased hes just so slow hes just so slow like its not even like his body but almost like his mind as well hes just he seems like hes moving at half speed and b also just was just pedestrian and kovich he his weaknesses were being exploited just not moving the ball fast enough and they just keep getting the ball to reuban at the top of the box and no one theyre just and they just didnt they could just didnt do anything weve seen this game reminded me there was a southampton game that they played against maybe like three years ago where they won one nil at the death on some cross and i think they put in like 40 crosses in this game i dont know if you remember that game like a couple years ago i no i cant remember it but theyve had this in their locker youre talking about the rogery aspect from certainly thats an issue the kevin aspect was also what weve been talking about and him missing the last four games and like it looks like he picked something else some new thing up after he trained for one day so its like i have im im like of two minds where its we see these last few games and you dont not only not want holland whos 15m but you dont want a city player you dont anyone and then also the thing that we talk about all the time is they have worldclass players and the best manager in the world so theyre not going to just keep doing this like theyre gonna improve and start scoring again because theyre gonna either win the league or finish like second so i dont know like im im conflicted in that sense of like yes holland looks bad and redistributing him to get an extra premium feels genius but then i also look at it and im just like are we back to trying to play the game on hard mode by taking a three sample size game period and extrapolating it over the next 30 thinking like hes bad like hes not bad hes not bad its just its just like a ridiculous thing i dont know what to make of its like i think part of it is also just like you like the reality of the premier league right you have no time ever to train especially if youre in champions league you have one day a week max to train and all you have time for is like lets prepare for the next opponent you cant like adapt and what happened when they lost kevin and roger at the same time is just all of their passing is out of the team theyre two best midfielders by a long range but also just the type of midfielders that they dont have to replace because like kova is good we like kova fodens good we like him savos look good every game but theyre all rico is good theyre all just like dribbly boys and no one can pass and like you were saying they just recycle possession recycle how many times because i went back and watched the second half how many times they get it to kovic who i 50 times and all he does is try and win a foul he just tries to like up trick you hopeful wolves guy sticks his foot and win a foul and then they get a free kick from 25 yards great and guess whos not scoring if all they get is corners in 25 yardage is holland so like you said i agree peps gonna think of something because hes great but right now its just like get out of here like get out of town its just hard to its hard to imagine theyre just going to turn it turn it on at a nowhere and just like starts creating huge chances everywhere i think its also ian i didnt have holland for very long last year i was did it very badly at the game as i usually do but i didnt have holland for a long time and it just felt like paddling upstream the whole time because he you we were accurately not captaining him in the away games and the nonhome bankers and he did have that the away wolves game ironically last year was when he had five returns i think they had two pens and i was that was fun for me not having him in that game but like if youre looking at his run after the southampton game this week which i do want to talk about as like is he the best captaincy option but looking past that they dont have a good home banker against a bad team i dont know if everton is bad they tend to fall apart against the good teams but thats game make 18 and thats like were looking at almost 20 were almost like 2025 their home games after southampton are spurs nfl man united everton a lot of aways in there and then they have west ham 20 at home and then some aways so i dont know its like i think you need to commit and look see am i happy to may be captain this week against southampton and then hold and not cap for a while unless if things change or get rid which either way you can make very cogent arguments i think against for other cases right and im leaning right now towards getrid like you were saying like everton normally im like theyll score five pep d thats what happens every year imagine im ining them crossing 45 times against everton just like i cant watch that i cant captain a guy in that game because tco and bran just heading balls out all day like thats das dream as you crossed that so i just i looked it up while youre were talking so how many times is man city under pep crossed 40 or more times and its 12 times thats crazy in like should be like three 400 games it should be less than that thats very little like i dont i havent like looked specifically into these matches like maybe theres red cards or weird but the results are horrendous when they do they have two wins in these 12 games so like some its almost a clear indication that something is just very f broken if this ever happens and its happened twice you it just happened and no it didnt happen again this season but like the other games were just as bad it feels like its happening it feels like its happening all the time so youre youre more leaning towards getting right after southampton and just spreading it around more i think so which i used two of my four free to get him fed and now im just like i do feel a little bit but like ah god i wish i just had my freeze because like i maybe would have kept olly like thats some like i dont you dont need any money if youre ever getting rid of holland so but i figure it out i dont know im im leaning towards holding him okay i just holding and not capping holding and not because i feel like i can do i feel like i can do that fine in a fine way and not like forsake too much just by spreading it around because i think you have your two mids that you need or whoever to have the like whether its sun or mo or palm god or saka or whatever like its not like were were spreading this around from so many players and i just feel like it just changes so fast right like we after the arsenal game in game week five were like all the entire preseason everything we learned from last year were sitting here like never captain him in away games only captain them in home bankers and after five games of watching them destroy everyone and him do all the things all the time at newcastle home full of at wolves two away games two one medium home game and he just blinks them all and now were talking about getting rid of him and i just like a good point i cant oscillate from extreme to extreme and ahead and im just like i dont know hes good theyll win a pen periodically right like i just hes just like bumo now hes just im just like forget him like maybe they play well against bournemouth and brighton and im like game m 12 home spurs ill just like ill just captain him because things change in three weeks or its after the international break and hes i dont knowbe vodin will change things maybe cuz i cant imagine its so savio and doku and like that would that would blow my mind so its got to be like jack and foden and maybe another midfield try i think thats a good point because like you said and this was totally a preseason note of mine is like when team when things arent going well you should expect the manager and players to make changes and when things are going well you should expect the opposite so what are we doing southampton though so youre thinking not capting because said what three city players should we have for their upcoming demolition to southampton and ethical said do we get foden for southampton i its still the best fixture in the league home ip switch isnt far away ip switch have fallen off the whatever they were on they look bad now no greaves who plays them bumo youre going to cap buo over holland i just said theyre the same player im think about it i am thinking about it and hopefully bu just put everyone off the scent because he was so bad at man united maybe last time i c booma i worked pretty good home south home southampton for city is like you expect them to just give them goals for fun but also im just like i dont they do i think its its just its a consideration i think you still probably are supposed to in holland they play midweek well see what happens well revisit at the end of the week but i also wanted to come back around on city the defense dude we got to talk about the defense we have to talk about the defense like look vard bangs a off foot top bins worldy which is an actual laugh riot joke that even happened but its a joke but also like at what point are we like hes just a donger like i him not scoring five plus goals a year at this point im just like hes gonna no thats fine thats fine g hell score his few goals a year but the defense is ridiculous its just so bad they have one this year through eight and theyve had many very easy many easy games its the thing thats insane about watching them play is like their like xg whatever isnt that high but theyre not like letting up low xg chances in accumulation its like its not that high and theres like a few enormous chances that make the low number overall and i just feel like every time i watch them its like without roger like they just either the backline drops off or someone falls asleep or someone cuts in behind or and its just like its a matter of when its like they let up between two and four absolute gigantic chances every single game and theyre letting up the least amount of shots per game and the second highest quality chances per shot to switch that doesnt work theyre coning theyre just getting run right down the gut by whoever the fastest player is on the other team doesnt matter who saato or adama or whoever the and it happens multiple times its so easy i feel like for these teams to play against them which without r its without roger and like the and not having walker there for the recover pace which makes up for a lot they have ruban still somehow the year 2024 he still plays every game he cant move and stones is still playing in the backline just put him at striker godamn play him up in the box but like even if its a kanji or stone it doesnt matter theres just no pace in the backline and ricos just like a little small guy and even when he has some pace but he just get shug off the ball by any player so theyre theyre just a mess and like i vardal look i got it we were talking about it a couple weeks ago the fixtures and but hes just not a good pick like i get the dong or whatever like i dont care like the way you watch this team and youre not spending six million on a on a defender period youre just gonna be lucking into points if he keeps doing this it just theres no sustainability and rico like we talk about ricos always good compared to the other four fs well hes still taking up the spot on your team hes still getting no points and maybe hes not like maybe hes not cuz he just doesnt do anything like he does and also like its the same right its it works the same as i just said with holland and it works negatively for the defense right if something is not working you should expect it to change so like he started three in a row great theyve been awful in every game and conceded in every game and are lucky he been a big reason why and theyre very lucky to seven points very lucky and he could get dropped he probably will get dropped like just waiting for kyle or gonna put a kanji back at right back or stones back at right back hes gonna try stuff to fix it and its just hes so lightweight like ive been watching him very closely in the last handful of games and he just hes annoying to watch hard to watch he they he changed his role in the second half he was playing a lot more deep in the first half but like he just he just goes into this little half space on the right mid right striker eight fre eight side whatever he just doesnt do anything he just stands there he comes he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass he shows for a ball he makes a wall pass he maybe hell make a couple of maybe forward passes but broadly speaking he just doesnt shoot he doesnt create anything he just doesnt do anything and i dont care what his price is i think hes just a bad pick and theyre not keeping clean so hes been frustrating and i think im im like past my boiling point with him i think after southampton if he starts midweek i might get rid of him but im im im im very concerned about him and very concerned about the defense at large and especially because rogers roger didnt strain his hamstring hes out for the year out for the season so why are there why is there clean sheeter defense prospects going to improve theyre not going tole that goes back to the pep thing right its like clearly whatever theyve done to address the rogery kevin double injury has not worked attacking or defending eventually theyre going to put up some good performances keep a string of cleans win a bunch of games i think theyll get it right but until then hes just a bad pick fs a bad pick edersons a bad pick but do you think that hes gonna start dropping off and playing cuz to me when i look at the squad and the players they have available what they should be doing is playing deeper and coning possession more and trying to get holland in space and trying to break thats they havent played that way since peps been there like whats he gonna do like i i dont know what hes going to do make one of the midfielders stay deeper make bilva be the deepest midfielder hes done that before relying on like gundo and kovic like its eight years ago and theyre going to cover all this ground and win the ball and its just not realistic at all i think that like as much as he loves gundo like a son hes just gonna watch the tape of the games and just be like good god this is not working at all all right i honestly stones in midfield is like not i dont know why he hasnt something like that like could do that could do that okay citys a mess citys a mess somehow they have all these point how are you feeling with rico you have rico as well he stinks most defenses stink we did get questions on that j phoenix said who are the best defenders calli said i have trent and poro both seem like problems what defenders are good right now which is we can go towards liverpool we can go towards arsenal with the discussion we can talk about spurs but like which defense is good right now is a real question and its hard to answer list liverpool nf liverpools great the hardest pictures in the league i think nfo also is very easy like nuno team playing well theres no reason to not trust them to just keep some cleans they keep keeping cleans theyre good but theres very few teams very few teams that i trust i want to say that i do still trust arsenal i do these red cards are dumb and etta teams for some reason get way more red cards than everyone else but do you feel the same way or are you like wavering with your arsenal guys the missing personnel is starting to compound for me like odard missing is something we almost have as like not even its it happened so long ago that we dont even realize it but he is the most important player like he does everything for them getting going forward space pace intelligence like he just does so much for them that every injury past him i feel like its like it makes such a huge amount of difference and like theyre just players are just trying to do too much almost right where everyone is trying to play like an extra an extra gear and then they look just like an extra gear worse because of that almost saka misses a game and the defense has just been i trust the defense from a systemic standpoint of like how he has them set up and the control hes trying to output influence but dude they like havent played with the same back line i think twice all year almost if you like they its white back which is nice but but like now like gabrielles played all the games right he started every game other than that its like white timber cba calori zenko played like its just i think gabrielle and cba have started every game celba just got the red but white just came back timber now is her cal fury started starting but hes played i think both on the left and the right or has he just played on the left i cant remember exactly but but then its its that compounded with like wheres rice playing wheres tom playing is george marino marino is new he doesnt know what the going on and its just all of a sudden he played kai in midfield a game or two here or there right and all of a sudden its just like all of the its just so many moving parts and the thing that made them grind everyone else to dust last year to me was he played the same 11 all year like every game he had every like 3000 minutes from like nine players or whatever and everyone just did the same thing and it was unstoppable and now they have a fixture pile up and they have injuries and im not like that confident i still i still like them a lot but youre also paying an absolute up the noose premium on them right barck said do we sell our arsenal defense especially if were doubled up no cleans in the last three pretty disappointing next three dont inspire much confidence and jeff said if you have double arsenal d are sick of it do you dump rya for pford or gabrielle for lewis well forget about lewis we but i just feel like thats also insane like to get rid it just feels crazy to me right im im right there with you its its it is crazy and these red cards someone posted in our discord like they have way more red cards than any other team since artetta got there so like i dont know whatever hes injecting them with before the game its too much he needs to dial it back the aggression and the stupidity but theyre not going to keep getting reds its its not possible and they do still have cleans well its also like the southampton leester concessions are nonsense right they were they were not both all three of those goals were absolute ridiculous banana and nonsense goals so they were in complete control there and if they kept one clean in those two games lets not even say both right youre sitting here and youre saying like theyre just they have four cleans in eight and but its just that with three red cards with three red cards like and look they do have tough fixtures upcoming they have liverpool newcastle chelsea pressure makes diamonds like they are good at cleaning tough games because they have to be on it and theyre not complacent and gabrielles sticking his finger up the enemys bum holes right you have to you have to so i dont care that much about that i just feel like if you have them you hold them and if youre looking to make money but also its just like for who like i would like to see that team but i think it all goes back to the overall belief that both of us have which is just like i dont want to touch my keeper i dont even want to touch my defenders theres too many high upside premium attackers who are amazing getting quadruple returns and like thats where i want to use my transfers my biggest problem is never gabrielle or rya like theyre just going to get cleans and get points like dont care but i do think liverpool maybe are leap frogging them for best defense in the league honestly after watching the chelsea game theyre the chelsea game if anything like confirmed that we should believe in the defense cuz like they just are like you can have the ball as much as you want were not going to were not going to get baited by this press ever and were not were not doing anything risky were just going to stay in shape and youre going to do nothing and they can see the one nico chance and he does a good finish and can you could look at that and interpret it any way you want second clean sheet can canate has given up of the season but theyre great if you concede one chance thats good well get to liverpool for the other two arsenal questions vikings said kai do we sell or hold arsenal playing a lot with 10 men fixtures about to get tough who are the good replacements and then golf said does arsenal have a stench who stenching its not stench levels come on we gota we got to relax with that theres still maybe best team in the league like theyre still so good but its just been a up start to the season i dont know where what are you feeling about with kai hes eight3 right now he has four goals one assist through eight where you at i think its a i think its a transfer out i dont think its a emergency youre insane if you transfer him out hes a good player hes going to get returns but do i want him in home liverpool at newcastle at chelsea home nfo like the answer is no i dont want him at all in those especially if saka is out we know od guards still out but saka to me saka is by far their most important player and if hes out they just have nothing relying on like trossard to make the killer pass and marino to do stuff in the box im like get out of here martinelli martinelli off so well they play midweek so well have a better idea well have a better idea after champions league but for me for me its a transfer out gaming 13 talk to me about kai talk to me about saka we ill be interested again ill be back but thats exactly what i was just trying to say about the defenders is like i want to use my transfers here because i see i could move to someone get more points more goals or double change and make him at a premium mid maybe a captaincy option if were not captain holland etc so yep thats where i want to go fair as for which forwards chris wood is isnt it so obvious god it just is its just so ridiculously for the next four if you dont include gameing 12 when they play city when they play arsenal you just you start him in the in gimick 9 10 11 13 with a lot of confidence he could have braced today easily he has pens hes great i dont know what to say it does feel overthinking to not have what at this point is insane is it if you told me this two years ago like youre going to be doing this podcast in two years its gonna be like december november and youre gonna be saying chris wood is one of the most obvious fors in the game like youre transfer your arsenal for to chris wood youre insane but its close i all of a sudden theyre just like the forwards there are all these budget forward options putting their hats in the rank and there then thats it wiissa strand coa like jim jim i forgot about jim we got questions about these guys too i all of the above would you rather buy dom or jim or wood thoughts on cheap forward shan larson versus jim versus wiissa do you have big preferences on these because jim also his form is just unbelievable it was a little bit of a weird one where you got the goal kick assisted goal and he had another little half chance here there but i think wiis is the best of the of the bunch honestly just looking at the fixtures and looking at the player home ip switch at fulham homeborn with at everton home lester easily the best pictures of all the pretty good hes 59 and hes done it before and i think that the player is good bren hammer a little bit mix bag and but theyre getting theyre getting fitter and the npcs are npc so i like wia the most i like that i like that i think strand is probably second because this fixture runs just longer my thing with wood that im a little bit uncertain of how to handle is like you want to transfer out youre gna want to transfer him out soon because the run gets bad fast so like if you dont already own him are you buying him over these plays im just not because again its similar to a defender right you dont want to use your transfers on the spot right its at lester home western home newcastle at arsenal home iip switch then it gets bad at city at united home villa at brenham spurs everton w liverpool so so after the next youre looking at the next five and you probably have two and a half good ones arsenals bad and then what theyre going to lay an egg in one or two of them but i dont know i just i feel like hes hes all of a sudden like just going lower and lower on the power ranking as his run declines its like the length of his run it impacts the quality of the pick a lot i think i rate tran larson just like pure ey test i just think he does a lot of good stuff and i honestly dont think wolves are that bad i know that they have no wins bottom of the table all the and they have the hardest ever imaginable schedule so far and i just think theyre very im not saying theyre good but i just think theyre like okay like theyre whatever they have some guys they can move the ball into the final third they can cross the ball and i just think he just played against every best team in the league like the top five at least and he doesnt have to play against them anymore he is for his one and two hes one and two so i think hes great hes the cheapest of this group i think now hes 55 longterm hold like you said you dont want to use a transfer on this spot and you will not use a transfer on this spot until maybe gw 19 like that with trent larsson so thats as good as you can get i think even though he doesnt have pens still good and which would does have its because interesting would and d have that well dcl is something else but thats also like looking at wood and wiissa because they have like a similar convergence of like they have the next few good fixtures and then it gets bad and like i dont know wiissa not having pens versus what having pens its it does make a big difference and then its its almost like you going to just are you resigned to make a transfer in december on the player or not or is this a rotation and you have to look at your team and think about like how am i seeing the season how am i going to play how am i whens the i think what you have to do planning wise is like when is the next time i want to rotate out my premiums like when is the next triple three transfer week because that impacts if you want someone whos good for four game we or if you want someone whos good for 11 game weeks right totally like im on three free now im sure im going to use at least two this week i think assuming like saka is hurt ill probably get rid of kai ill move to a premium mid whatever but im going to want those arsenal guys back i think game we 13ish like that 13 14 just for a pretty long good run of p and i still like them both a lot so i cant think of it as like ill just get wood and then ill move him to strand larson and then ill move him to blah its like no i already booked all these transfers like im getting the arsenal guys i dont i have no freeze is like how i should be looking at it and ca is also there 65 like hes hes who we presumably believe to be on pens for wolves is that correct i think so as cabia doesnt play anymore he doesnt play anymore so hes also a pick there right but its also just like where is the meta moving like do we want to have we havent mentioned salanki 77 talk about him and spurs or but just a note on this like how many it seems like everyone should have at least one sheep forward like but should it be two the correct two like that is that the best now five mids maybe maybe but because it also in the back of my mind like watching eso im just like im gonna want to get him soon he should have braced he should have braced he should red and this is they play chelsea and arsenal and then nfl away which isnt we thought would be good but is not and then they have a pretty good run forever so im just like also looking at that like well every he was in 60 of teams in game this is the guy dude didnt i say this is the we learned our lesson with rich last year and were going to forget about him guy and hes gonna like they dont have a slam dunk run of fixtures at any point they have like just enough to splice it up to make it look not so good but like he goes back to one of those where he plays once a week i dont know if calums going to be back at some point and maybe hes wing and then who knows but like hes playing once a week and has pens and theyre looking competent again and everyones getting fit again so like hes also some like well i want to get him soon and like if i go down to all these six million forwards like what am i doing so its and also like if isach is who everyone thought he was at the beginning of this season everyone knows he was at the end of last season i dont give a if they have two hard fixtures in 10 or whatever like he could score in anyway he was unreal last year so it doesnt even matter i like that shout a lot starting in 12 this incredible run incredible run its just theyre only definitely hard one is home liverpool and even that at least its at home the rest are good till march february whatever good so i love that shout i love that shout and they honestly played well against brighton they should have won the game for sure you have spurs stuff because you watch that match im only living on highlights but to get four goals with no bj involvement no dom involvement the fluky own goal assist then is taken away weird goals and weird game yes it was a weird game weird goals its just so much more down to western being so diabolical to me than spurs being good spurs probably they could have scored six you would have been would have been chance that he hit off the inside of the post and they let the foot off the gas for the last half hour like they stop stopped playing but subing mat early was very interesting one there subbing him at half its its just they just attack so much right they just relentlessly attack and they barely play any defenders and the defenders that they do play are all fast and play at the halfway line so dogs is in the box the whole highlight the whole highlights he was in the box and por shooting from distance like it was either one or the other doing that so sun was like also just very pedestrian to me like as i used to seeing him be where it just against a good defense he just blanked easily comfortably blanked and against west ham its just like he looks like a world beater where his shots that weve been watching him just get blocked all season are just like going through or whatever and ariol had a bad game arol is hes hes passing to the other team but you just looking at their fixer run in the thursday games its just its hard to ascertain like is this is this a buy is this a is a sell like hes 99 now he just went up today they play home it if switch and 11 which weve been talking about is like a good captaincy game but other than that its just like its like some good some bad if hes playing on thursday and theyre playing on sunday its like its not great youre stacking him up against all of the other players saka palmer oi foden holland you can only have so many of these players so presumably as pens do they ever win pens the answer is no so theres a player thats on pens that doesnt win pens on pens i dont know its like tree falling in the tree falling in the woods if no ones around to hear it but i dont know im just still very lukewarm i dont know its its very bizarre like i just feel very lukewarm im less lukewarm again im only on highlights didnt watch the full game but i do think that like a lot of the west ham looking diabolical is what spurs do like thats what their thing is press you win the ball in the third make two passes get a shot off whatever theyve been scoring a lot of goals lately a lot of goals and i think that like fen didnt even start so i dont like what are we even talking about when were saying like foden versus palmer versus son its like he doesnt even start and he got a lucky assist at in the 95th minute so i dont even know if he should be in the convo but to me the question is like palmer in newcastle man united arsenal or son in palace who are a bottom three or four team right now home villa ips switch and to me that answerers son its fair because i dont know what to make fully out of the liverpool chelsea game was a complicated game but what liverpool did to palmer was just like hey guys heres the blueprint if curtis jones can just completely mark him out of the game and score a goal and get an assist but just like curtis just humiliated him i feel like he just wasnt also could have easily scored a goal like he had a good no he had that one good chance like that was the best chance that was blocked and he did nothing otherwise and it was just like okay new newcastle can do that can man utd do that like probably not like theyre just bad but and they have no midfielders that can run around that much but arsenal and newcastle can surely do that like got i dont know im just i want to wait for 12 for palmer is what im getting at here where he will just bully these bad teams and he will get more space and time on the ball and when he will get another quad return or whatever the hes up to and i look at these harder games a bit differently after that liverpool game so sun suns a pick son hes definitely a pick you still just can back door into the he has pens so you have that going for you pens a lot of attacking a lot of shooting sure sure youre just trying to find your braces and i think he has a better chance of braces in the next run that a lot of people asked about sun fod and palmer saka etc jeff d do we prioritize palmer or mo or sun to replace s i havent even talked about mo slim said i want to ask you guys do you think its mo to palmer still thats still a move to make no question right i dont know what do you think between all these premium mids like who what do you think is the priority whats your priority i think the priority is the fixtures its just its all so much of a muchness like you look at mo as like if he didnt take a pen he just didnt do anything like he created two and no but like you create two and a half chances like okay whatever maybe youll get a sixpointer youre not looking at the doors are being blown down like my god i dont even did he even have a shot like other than that like two shots maybe would be my guess open play he had he just didnt do anything besides the pen but so the pen is papering over a lot of cracks i think with the mo the mo argument and its similarly with sun like if he got the fake assist and youre looking at this like huge double digit hall where its like whatever you make you make he also had that humongous chance that he almost he finishes nine times out of 10 that hit like the inside of the post and bounce across the go line like my god thats true thats true i think its more like you just want to play the medium the like next four to seven game we fixture run of im gonna hold this premium for this period of time and then im gonna get this other premium in this spot for this period of time because you you can do as much analysis as you want of like which premium player gets point like saka is so good in hard fixtures its like i dont care i still want him for the easy ass bad fixtures and id rather have like sun in home bankers than salah who performs well in hard fixtures for a hard fixture run so its like every time and like thats where i feel like you want to try and angle yourself towards so that you have the rest so the answer is sun and foden right well foden i think is a little bit stickier because is what the we dont know if hes starting he has no avenues except for we dont know if city are good we dont know if theyre good so thats messier but i think its probably i think its just its just messy like i think we all have holland i think its certainly sun with the fixtures in the in the near horizon and then its probably like palmer and 12 or maybe sakade or maybe palmer now like watkins i dont know its youre going to have to take a couple of bad fixtures on the chin here because if youre looking at just shortterm like next three its sun and theres no one close for me like between of all the premiums like between liverpool arsenal chelsea villa like its son after that i think it dovetails nicely with palmer and thats like immediately where ill go in 12 no nonnegotiable sun could score 500 goals the next three matches and hell still make the transfer i think its team dependent too there because he loves playing that city and i think thats a good sunf fixture and then home fham at bourem like i think you could hold him past that i i am sitting here with foden in my team saying ill transfer him out like maybes a nightmare fodens probably gonna always be a worst p than sun unless if hes playing southampton i switch like two or three but but i think its also you look at your team structure and figure out like what am i doing with my team structure how many how many premium mids holland and no premium forwards or you im g have watkins or kai or whatever and going from there and figuring out like where am i sending my transfers for sure okay we got some liverpool questions but mainly just about the defense cink said if you have both which you do would you drop trent or robo i know trents better but is he worth one million more jitterbug is trent deard worth using a transfer on when city can clean to save their lives and then sammy also thoughts on selling trent obvious cash cow when looking add a premium midfield and pool have tough run in the next few weeks with their champions league games blah i think i know what youre going to say but what do you think about that i want to add a third liverpool defender i want to get kate for my leis spot honestly like i do i just do look one negative for robbo and trent this weekend were they just played fullback they were not playing they were not playing attack attacking positions at all robo had maybe like a small diance in the second half towards the end of the game where he was getting forward a couple of overlapping but he was also getting rinsed which is he was he was all hands on deck trying to defend and he had help and all that but but i just still just going back to what were were talking about earlier is like they played chelsea who is fourth best team in the league top four or other than liverpool a top three attack in the league and they held them to nothing one chance so i so i look at like look yes theyre playing arsenal in a game that i think could just be non a noname and the just the amount of control that hes trying to influence on the games i just like this team i dont care about the fixtures i just feel like i want as many defenders as i can get on this team and i like it so so my near term is like i want to make lewis kate and i want to hold robo as little attacking threat as he has like making that transfer to white or cba just feels like a waste of time because i voice of free theyre very similar and trens still taking tren rob was still taking they had no corners this game somehow i dont know that was a very weird thing theyve been getting very few corners on the seas i feel like its like a directive they dont go to the bine they dont p crosses they do the opposite savio and do they just recycle they dont they dont even try to get the corner i wonder if thats also because its like they think theyre gonna theyre more likely to concede off a corner than score on a corner i could see that but liverpool defense i just im so hard on that like i just feel like thats like the biggest like thats like to me like my biggest edge play is just like i want liverpool defense as much as possible im very there to me trent is just still the best aventer in the game even with this insane run im still just like man that chelsea game was everything for me cuz we had not played a single good team in europe or the league and then to do that i was just like like i believe now and like sammy mentioned in his thing they have arsenal this week they have city and 13 they have a bunch of tough ones in between but like home brighton home villa at southampton like those are all those are just control the game shut them down type of games so y im with you im with you there all right lets go to some questions and how i feel about a triple up on a defense hello that just means its f field baby like f fields back yes sir yes sir thank you sir and then your mood 100 depend 100 depends on if that team cleans or doesnt clean so f thats fun its chill its its good vibes its good vibes lauren said interesting one he said what are your thoughts on a free hit game week nine for teams like mine who dont have holland or palmer like alons free hit 2 plan that never was we know chips are less valuable this season i have three arsenal and two liverpool playing each other as well interesting right i its not insane to me palmer is not part of the equation for me i do think that like newcastle play up to their opponent they played so wellan city joe linton bruno tanali are gonna be up palmers ass all game like whatever its like i think the with palmer similar to all the other premiums like a return is what you should expect but is it a cr like a cricket score like is that something that can happen and if the answer is no then youre fine to not have that player right exactly but looking at dodging arsenal versus liverpool and liverpool versus arsenal and like getting on jumping on a bunch of city not having holland this week feels scary even if with all the negative we just said about holland rammers could just give him a hattrick bednerick and just southampton players will create the chances for holland it doesnt matter like theyre we know what russell martin rusty russell martins going to do and hes going to all out attack and try and possess and be the better team and its going to be a joke i dont love it i but i also dont hate it you hate it i think i hate it i think that youre going to be better placed to use it later when there are blanks like even if its not these expens used to i dont know i just it just it just feels a little short i think the other thing too is hes talking about like my liverpool and its gonna be a nil right right like hes not talking defenders hes not talking about which players he has or how many frees he has its g to be a stodgy affair so if you have like kai mo and saka problem maybe we can talk about it a little bit more but like thats where you just use your freeze there you dont want you dont want soccer with rsl players anyway they have like bad so big daddy said what do you guys see with garnacho very happy to asked this question because okay you go on i missed this game so ive been i watched this ive been very high on garnacho i in higher than most united fs i think honestly for like over a year now he under the radar liam pointed out to me has just started and played 90 for four straight games which was like the only question mark for him i was like is if hes starting hes a incredible pick he takes 50 shots a game hes an absolute genius little demon hes taken the leap last season hes a star i want him in my team immediately they have great fixtures except for chelsea and 10 hes cheap way underpriced and great i think everyone should get him thats about that all right over bj bj man maybe both but garnacho first make sure in order of youre clicking the buttons you bring in garnacho first if youre bringing six2 62 i just i just dont know where you fit him in like who are you forsaking for him rogers seeno hes better than both of them a lot better seeno a lot better what cena is good he doesnt take eight shots he doesnt take eight shots a game not yet and hes at villa home city i dont know mishka do you believe in regression to the mean or is that an fpl fallacy is holland destined to triple return next and spurs will lose to palet with an a brace and a pen talk to me about regressing to the mean well talk to me about the concept of believing in it or not like its a religion well isnt it just a statistical its just how statistics work i think the confusing part maybe for mish is what it means which is like me too can you teach me well because i think we always joke right like vv do like blahs blanked three in a row theyre due to score thats not how it works if holland were to blank 10 gamings in a row we would not expect him to score hes going to score six in one of these games to balance it out what it means is that hell go back to their normal average rate of scoring aka the mean and therefore it will like a curve back to over time it will curve back to where we expected them to be in the first place it doesnt mean theyre just going to make up for everything he holland blank three in a row hes scoring seven this week at southampton so that it averages out to like he shouldnt have blanked three in a row thats not what it means but thats what it means its just like you should expect them to do put their mean performances whether theyre hot you should expect mean performance whether theyre cold you should expect a mean performance over time thats all it means cool hardly boys so i just put up a week where i had zero returns as in not even a midfield or clean sheet point i should just quit right not even a midfielder clean couldnt find a four pointer any forward clean banks that was nice when wood bank the clean today i like those like those shots i can skip some of these cutler do you want to discuss everton defense if we have piw should we be doubling up are we in the middle of their run of queens that gets them out of trouble they were never in trouble never in trouble theyre great i dont know what to say great team for cleans good run of fixures get them out game week 15 they have wow gw 15 ive never seen anything like this they play the four best teams in the league in a row home liverpool home chelsea at man city what well thats great love it but theyre great i dont know what to say doesnt matter if you have pi dont have pickford you should get a defender speaking of defenders x50 said brenford havent kept a clean all season but theyve have a good run coming up and pinck and are donging their lives away is there a defender pick here or are there other cheap defenders you like more so bad theyre just bad like theyre a bad team they attack a bit and there but the spacing is just every game is just very schizophrenic so looking at the four five plays i just i just get i im not sure what are you doing with your defense like are people rotating four or five defense fixture plays like i dont think theyre rotating but i do think that a lot of people have like premium and then 145 theyre just like starting every week for 10 gamings like that i just think thats misguided like to me its like i want to have three defenders that are on good teams like i just i feel like thats the a better way to play this year just more predictable city being a good team is very subjective but but i just feel like youre just going to go a lot farther by spending an extra 0 five or million on that spot not having to worry about collins or newcastle like rotation and then someone gets hurt you have to spend another transfer there its its just a mess like i think you just get three start every weeks is where im at this year one little study that someone should do not me is like what percentage of a defender points come from cleans versus attacking returns versus bonus points and integr because its probably a very high percent very high percent prob like 85 so the idea of getting a defender who you dont expect cleans from despite a good run is just ridiculous they need to be ivanovic like eight goal marcus a eight goals six assist levels to even consider them and if youre looking at like maybe pinck will get me a goal in the next eight game weeks while they keep maybe like one clean its like thats nowhere near good enough its not even in the vicinity of good enough you need cleans thats my on that you need cleans you need cleans last question was giannis he said for non holland owners which captain is best bumo palmer or rogue foden boo its got to be bumo its gotta be bo i think palmers fine cap theres not going to be any leaks because theres a friday game so you cant go fod you just cant do that to yourself think palmers fine but i would go boomo like it like the shout like it like it like it okay cool dude were back f feels back anything else you want to talk about well villa we didnt talk about for one second i you watch this game i watch highlights it was a very strange game very open game its its it just makes me so confused about oli of like what to do with him i know asset unreal header the header was unreal and he had another chance or two that he didnt finish an open play had a oneonone but like they play midweek and its hard to know what eon like he subbed him early because he wants to not he played 75 whatever he wants to play him in europe but they have barmouth at home on the weekend and its going to be their third game of the week and they have spurs liverpool palace chelsea like i dont i know you just got r and im sure a lot of it was because of the run and you didnt think that looked good for him but what do you what do you see with oly im just its hard when a manager gives us different things all the time when like hes said one week hes like were not even going to attempt to attack man utd were just going to sit on a nil and im very happy with that and then next week against fulham hes like i want to play a transitional up and down open space game the whole game and like ali could have triple returned and so getting those like inconsistent data points is hard for me i think to navigate but that said spurs liverpool chelsea coming up like im pretty sure i know how hes going to play those and theyre all away like hes hes playing for a nil in those and allis going to start all of them and allis still great and alli might be on pens but i just think for n million youre not getting like the bang for your buck there at least in the short term like i would just rather that be son and then palmer or just palmer straight up or but its certainly not a problem short end the stick certainly not a problem they could they could score three against bournemouth no problem happens all the time the home bournemouth is the one thats like thats where i was like okay i want to just try and see if i can hold on here its just a good picture for a good team but thats other thing too where im like well bournemouth get to just train and chill all week and they have to play midweek and then play again its like after they already played internationals im just like my god like you they are they gna come out and just get flat look flat and get battered by a more fys team im concerned about you see what pow just did to jim im like good luck against seeno like thats a problem for them i think hes a good start this week but i think like next five i would just rather spend that money elsewhere and hes another one that falls in the same boat of like maybe hes 14 you just bring him straight back home breon what do you see about with rogers like are you happy to hold to play him in some of these tougher games because hes so cheap or no not happy you just you just want to bench him im not happy with that bench or transfer venture transfer thats thats what i think about him and like i listen i know hes a very fit young strapping young lad but hes not playing 90 in europe and 90 in the league all season no well hes also not possible hes also looked i know hes returned recently but hes looked bad like he looked better in the games he wasnt returning the beginning of the year than he has in like the first four game weeks i think he looked a lot better than he has in the last four game weeks he had he had no returns in the first four he has a lot of returns in the last four so hes not playing 5000 minutes and if he tries like the turn and dribble and take on three men against spurs in game week 10 like hes going to get like theyre just gna press the out of him and win the ball nonstop and same with liverpool and same with chelsea im not saying hell complete zero dribbles like that but its just not he needs a rest and like i dont think those games cater to his skills thats fair thats fair villa tough one so many good picks great its a great fpl season its a great f season no it is it is it is and it make its made better by towers well if they can just its its nice to know they can take away goals or assists at any point while they can do whatever they want they can adjust bonus points tomorrow i dont know if its on i tweeted at them before we poed i said are bonus points confirmed yet or goals and assists no response no response which

blackbox ahead of gameweek nine take two how are you Mr Andy mode you right I'm not too bad mate yeah is it is still lagging or are we all right no no we're good I think that's it I tried quite an optimistic setting the resolution to 4K and I think that might be the reason why things were as great as they were um but hello to to everyone I'm sorry that Mr Mark sus isn't here but it's great to see you you and if you're your first black boox of the Season isn't it it is indeed it's the first black box of the Season yeah um I've missed it it's been a while I don't know the last time I was on I know obviously my favorite one was when we were roasting your wild car but I think that was a little while back now that was a Friday night mid midseason wasn't it wasn't it you know the exact Before Christmas yeah probably burned into my into my mind luckily my season started a little bit better this time so it's not quite as uh as as bad has it been have you found the season so far you you been enjoying it uh it's not been too bad I I've I've had a little bit of a struggle so far this season usually I'm a little bit higher than this but it's been I I've made a few moves a little too early and that sometimes hurt me and I seem to have avoided the Liverpool midfielder points i' I've owned three of them and seem to have owned them all at the wrong times but it's it's picking up a little bit now got a green arrow this week so hopefully that can carry on and the team's looking all right so fingers crossed yeah it's I think this is the first time I've streamed with you for a while where you've been ahead of me actually which doesn't feel very nice I mean it was heading in the direction of it was going to be my highest rank for about 18 months but red this week after so many uh so like so many people it was a it was a it was a strange game week and we've you know we've got quite a lot to talk about we only have you for about 45 minutes because then you've got a yes a delivery coming which which is a supermarket of choice that's that's the key question is i' love to say like I'd love to say like okado or something like that but it's not no it's it's just tesos Tesco okay I thought you were a sous man but Tesco is is fine um yeah so we got we got lots to cover we're going to talk about um all the different stats marks on some great tables for us even though he's not here here we got our teams uh to cover uh and depending on how long Andy's around for um we've got predictions and everything else if Andy goes I I'll stay around for a bit and yeah answer some question and and things like that uh we do have a sponsor um for this week's episode and this is of course manscaped you are watching two bearded men on the screen right now I have the uh I don't know if you knew that that manscape do beard trimmers do you Andy as well as as well as The Bull Shavers I didn't know that no tell me more there you go well they do they do uh so I I use the manscape beer trimmer which which is great because we go for the more kind of longer longer beard uh look they've actually just bought out a brand new product called the chairman Pro which is for people who basically want an electric beard trimmer but want to go a bit closer to the skin so this is where the Five O'Clock Somewhere comes from you want a five o'clock shadow don't there's a video of it as

you can go for your stubble look or your clean shaven uh look pair it with your your beard trim if you want to grow it a bit longer you can pair it with your ball shaver if you want to have your Fresh

and use our code blackbox for 20% off before we get into game weeks and all of that stuff I think we have to cover the big talking point of the week and I know you've briefly spoken about it already um on the scow cast but it is this whole sack content creator cartel there's already comments about the cartel in the chat that I'm I'm seeing I mean what's your take on on sacka gate there was a lot of last minute moves from sacka to son to foden um you know from popular people within the community do you think there was anything untoward going on no we certainly didn't get any bloody news did we no I know and and I said this to you before we streamed is that if you're getting news and not telling me I'm not not going to be very happy so I'm pretty sure there is nothing going on behind the scenes I think it was just a lot of good managers making a good move sacka was not 100% Going to play and a lot of people wanted to move him on the next week anyway and I think that's just what they did they basically jumped on two assets that they thought could do quite well this week and had nice fixtures moving forward which was foden and son I kept sacka myself I moved havs out uh I kept sacka and obviously keeping sacka meant I got minkovich off the bench so actually actually worked okay for me I know jamm a little bit but actually I didn't move sacar out because I knew I had minkovich first on the bench and I think those people that had a good bench or a good person that could in there was less of a risk as those players that maybe didn't I can I can see why they made the move I want to move sacker out this week it was always my plan and if I thought he was definitely going to be out or I thought I need to move him out to get another player in I I see it as a good move personally so I do also think as well people keep forgetting that these managers could have like two three four transfers in the bank at the moment so like moving a player out like that there's less risk I feel doing it when you've got lots of transfers so I don't think there's anything going on personally and if it is I'm not privy to it uh so I'd be very surprised I mean you OB but there's there's nothing going on is there as my God I mean I'm getting I'm getting called out as as part of one of the people that that sold him you know with 20 minutes of the headline um and I you know you know what happened to me I got got by Bloody boer's tweet when he was impersonating that Arsenal and who sent you that list ah and obviously in the Godfather's chat bloody Mark Southerns shares it and he's been caught out before like that and I clicked on it and my normal check is just go over I was thinking of selling him anyway so I was looking for any excuse I click on the link he sends I check the subscriber numbers 20K I look through the previous tweets and they all look legit and that's what boa did really smartly if you could call it that this time is that he kind of created a bit of a pre Loop because normally it's just inject emojis you know and you're like oh okay clearly that's that's bua this time he done the ground workor and yeah it just it completely got me so I looked at that transferred sacker out went back to the group chat and someone said oh that's that's Boer Mark um and it was it was too late and that's normally the kind of thing that that catches you out and then obviously sacka didn't play foden was benched he came off and got the assist it was a real roller coaster Andy I'm not going to lie yeah um but yeah ultimately it was the right decision because I had dibling for a sub but yeah yeah it surprised me how many people had forgotten who bua was because obviously hasn't done anything for a little while and then all of a sudden I had people in chats going who's who's bua who's this bua why why do you all know that this is fake and as soon as there was an extra letter in the Charles wats thing I was like I know this is fake but the fact you actually did the sacka move because of it I thought I was absolutely brilliant and the fact Mark sent it to you as well but you brought foden in so it didn't turn out that badly did it no and obviously the two players that people were bringing in were were son and foden and both of them got some points for the owners and I think that's what kind of sha a bit more of a lens on it because had they both blanks I don't think people will care I just think I I I can I thought all week saaka would would play and it was only when I saw the team arriving at the stadium and he wasn't in any of the pictures and then we had the old Andy Martin thing of him going to the stadium and he's all of that was was just was just brilliant um but you know I was probably going to sell him this week anyway and because it was like 50/50 at that point I just thought you know what I'm gonna do it a week early and and and bring him in and SK says yeah getting buono in is a good cover story I love that as if I'd make that up to make myself look like that much of an idiot yeah what I love someone else in the chat has put um we know you two aren't getting leaks because look at your ranks it's like yeah if we were getting leaks You' really think I'd be 1.7 million at the moment oh I've told this story before I told it to you earlier but the the only the only leak I've ever had genuinely was last season someone messaged me I I spoke to a fair bit on Twitter and said just heard liento playing like today and he was in my team and I had him benched and I was like do you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna risk it I'm gonna play him off the back of that benched was complete rubbish it's the only leak I've I've ever had um yeah it's it is a funny one I mean what I did this poll and I just thought you know there's a lot of like PE there's a lot of people like trigger lips has done videos on it and Al's done videos on it and there's lots of people calling into question like the Integrity of content creators and I just thought out of the general Twitter lot so this is a sample of like 2,800 people if there was this secret WhatsApp group this cartel group that people think there is well some people think there is um you know which gets team leaks you're allowed to be in it but you're not allowed to ever share them and if if you ever share them you you're booted out immediately how many people would join it 76 % said they would join that League I love that so yeah I know it's people give it all the high Mighty and I think that 24% at least half of those would would would still you know would would do it really yeah I know and to be fair I said to you before the stream when you showed me these results the thing is there are some people out there that wouldn't join it because they're already part of it so you got to take that into account as well but but um I if if you offered somebody that opportunity of course they do it but I think as soon as you've got a certain amount of followers and I don't know how many it is specifically as soon as you got a certain amount of followers it's seen as is wrong if you do get leaks and things like that but you look at the biggest guy out there which is let's talk fbl he gets the leaks and he shares them all every single one he gets his shares so I don't really know what people want to be perfectly honest but I think it's F I don't think there really is anything going on that we don't really know most of the time no I think it's a shame with because Andy gets a lot of the brunt of it because kind of the biggest account and you know people say is he doing it for clout on his deadline streams but you know Andy doesn't build his deadline streams as being this is where you're going to get the leagues people turn up because he might get them and he has a list of of people that he trust that sometimes they in those leagues before but he always shares them with with people so I don't really know why he why he gets some of the stick that he does in this regard don't know I think people just attack people that are they've got a big following BAS I think and it's unfortunate but obviously that's where you get the most interaction sometimes so people wouldn't be doing it if they were just shouting into the void they want to make sure people interact back with them and that's obviously what they want half the time I guess um which that's what Twitter is isn't it yeah it's uh not been the best place over the last last week or so um hopefully it starts to pick up a bit and we can start having some nice chats again but yeah it's it's not not being the best place anyway let's talk some FPL uh stuff just quickly cover my team this week uh it was a bit of a disaster 33 points I'm sure a lot of people can sympathize with that Raya Trent Gabrielle Lewis and Davis all blanked in defense foden came in he got the assist from the corner in the 90th minute Four Points uh inom o to Rogers actually came in last minute for dibling who I'd been saying I was going to play all week and then I just suddenly went why am I playing as Southampton player let's just get Rogers back in uh so Rogers got the got the goal uh booked again though it always seems to get booked when he when he scores which is annoying yeah uh Harland with four Watkins did well for me with eight and salanki has been really disappointing with two and I benched Moreno who got six on my bench he would have been quite a nice differential but yeah a bit of a bit of a me game W best we just move on right yeah yeah let's just move on from this one we can move on to Mr Mark Southern's team actually managed to have a o worse worst with he got 26 uh I think fleen was his I know Rogers was his highest scorer but fleen was up there with four uh Trent CBA with minus three Lewis with two Gabrielle with one seeno Rogers and bumo F and harand salanki so a pretty similar team to to mine obviously had had celba with minus what did you make of the celba red card how do you think that's going to affect Arsenal going forward I think it is I I think on scoutcast the other day we did um a little bit of an analysis on Arsenal and it shows that they are already conceding more chances than they were most of last season and they're not putting up as much XG I think the odard injury is a massive difference I think he is such a controller of the ball in their Midfield and I think these have been a massive Miss I do also think they've played a lot of their games with with 10 men which obviously hasn't helped their XGC this season either and their disciplinary record is is shocking compared to the rest of the season it's compared to the rest of the teams I don't know what's happen like they wanted them to be kind of tougher and they're doing that by getting red cards all the time um which obviously isn't great for their assets and cbra celebra managers the people that went celebra and Gabrielle or CRA and Rya and went for that double Aral defense have been punished quite brutally to be perfectly honest and minus three from CBA is is you know that is brutal so yeah I think I think it is going to I think he's only going to miss one game isn't he but I think Arsenal double defense especially with their fixtures moving forward I think I'd be moving off one personally and when you got a player like say 8 Nori or someone like that who could be good you know especially from next week onwards I think I'd probably make the move myself yeah I mean I I it is a one match ban the commentators on the match definitely said it was a three- match ban and I went back and listened to it again and they said three matches but it's not violent play right so it's just a one match match that's how I thought it was yeah just one game yeah fine um so he's back for Newcastle and and Chelsea but obviously misses the the Liverpool game um so yeah not not ideal for Mark he's already made a couple of of transfers I'll talk about those um in a bit your team though absolutely flying 40 points oh coming up trumps mate it it wasn't looking that good uh I obviously I had I had Rogers as well who didn't do too badly I was absolutely gutted salanki got nothing um I was out I was out in town when it was happening I was every goal that went in I was thinking San's got to be involved and every time he wasn't involved so I was absolutely Gutt about that yeah but the big one was that those Forest players on the Monday night and obviously having word who could have had a hat-trick like he looked good again like he hit the post he had a few sitters that he missed and then milinkovic as well um milinkovic who I got in on wild card and I was kind of eyeing up some of these nice fixtures Palace we were talking beforeand and we put cells in our uh Strictly Come captain in um selections Palace honestly that all they do is just pepper goalkeepers from outside the box and they can't finish to say their low so that any keeper against him it looks absolutely brilliant to play him and obviously Sals got an 11 pointer in the end so the people that were waiting on say a SS and a wood for Monday night um got you know help themselves to 18 points but yeah they saved me massively so I was on about a 500K red arrow until Monday night and then I ended up getting a green arrow of about 100K so yeah I will very much take it can you remember the last time a Monday night game actually delivered for people it's been a while it has been a while um it used to quite I swear the one that sticks in my mind I'm pretty sure Hazard played against West H yeah and got um and got a brace or a hat trick or something wasn't it and he absolutely killed it on a Monday night I remember that quite vividly but if that's the last one I remember then that says a lot that's about eight years ago wasn't it eight years normally it's like you've got one or two players left on the Monday night and you you think right they can save my game week they can they can really do something for me and then you watch the clean sheet get wiped out after like 10 minutes and then player gets subed at 65 and you're like get up my whole Monday night for this but that was a good one for forest forest you know owners um it went it went well are you playing linkovich this week against Lisa I'm not he's first on my bench I think uh or second on my bench I can't actually remember now but yeah he's not in my team currently okay I've got Moreno so he is in my in my team at the moment uh this is the Great and the good obviously she've been added to this after um not usurping what's the word beating beating grayhead last year that was the punishment that he he faced you coming into this I'm top of the three of us somehow uh 785k which puts me fourth which is pretty surprising just below pra one point behind prz seven points behind Harry had an awful week again with with 26 prz and Harry both well praz Harry and Mark all with 26 uh pretty pretty remarkable Ben Kellin though 54 points with his son captain thing is we're looking at him as smashing it and he's only 300K like you know there are other people out there that are like already in the top 100K like hibo is obviously around the 100K Mark and I think it's absolutely mad that he's I feel like he's played really well recently Ben but like I said he's only 300K I expected him to be way more than that and that's after a almost 350k Green Arrow so yeah it's been it's been tough so far in this league I would say and I looked at my overall Rank and thought God I'm going to be bottom half of this easily so to be top half I think it says a lot about the kind of start of the season but we got to remember as well that it's very rare that we've had triple Captain be played quite as much as it has been so far obviously that's been played a lot so maybe that's t a little bit to be taken into account because all those that played Highland obviously got um 17 extra points so maybe that's skewing things a little bit but yeah it's been tough 300 KB in the top and most of us over one mil is is yeah not usual yeah I think it's been the Relentless form of as well I think you know quite a few people didn't start with him at the beginning like myself few a lot of people sold him on wild cards in in maybe gameing five or six and he's carried on doing really well you know two two double digit Halles in his last couple of game weeks so yeah if if you had if you had sellah you've been you've been doing well BL says it's the Bad and the worse good name good name for this league um I have to say um yeah Seb is is really struggling he's he's down 4.8 4.8 million obviously not doing the the Scout cast riew this season and just seems to love banking those transfers that's what does it that's what does it see you leave the Scout cast and it all goes to part no he's um I think I saw his his team value is like 99.5 as well like he's really like you said he's kept hold of those transfers and I don't think it's helped him yet but I'm hoping that he kind of has a couple good weeks and he starts storming on up but he's only what just under 50 points behind me and that's three million rank so he he'll make that up hold I thought yeah there's there's there's really not much in it between between a really good rank a respectable Rank and even a poor rank at this stage so yeah don't panic uh Don't Panic too much uh let's take a look at some stats this is team data uh defense and Liverpool are at the top of this they have we I think we all know that they're the best defends given from what we've seen which is obviously one of the major things that slot's bought in uh in his kind of brief tenure Villa a second interestingly not really a team that I trust particularly um but .89 um you know is is good obviously quite tough fixtures uh to come let's talk about Man City though I mean I've got Lewis I every week they just seem to concede it's really frustrating yeah I find with this team data defense stuff that like you've got Liverpool there okay they they seem like the you know the best defense at the moment but is it any other defense that you trust at the moment I mean funly enough forest was one that a lot of us you know kind of put a bit of put a bit of money into because that their data did look good and obviously they got the cheap options Lewis at least is cheap like we're not paying for gardol or something like that although he obviously turned into Prime Roberto Carlos at the weekend but I do think Forest I do think Forest are good Liverpool's an interesting one for me still they do look really good but their fixture run has been the best it could possibly be really up until now so the fact that their fixtures are changing now if they start keeping clean sheets and having this good a Daya against teams like Arsenal Villa City like then we can start really taking them seriously but I there's not a lot I mean I was thinking about this with goalkeepers there's not a lot of goalkeepers I fancy moving forward either but there's an awful lot of fixtures that are changing soon so if you've got those High upside Defenders like anate Nori or something like that I've already mentioned them anyway their fixtures change you dramatically moving forward brentford's are looking really good moving forward Brighton's look good after a while like all of a sudden you're looking at a few different teams and it's just based on fixtures really but I I think forest and Liverpool look the two best defenses I've seen so far Villa's interesting though because I thought Villa might struggle with with their whole you know playing in Europe this year but they've killed it in Europe and they seem to not be having too much of a hangover after after the games either so fair play to them um it's Arsenal's the biggest one for me it has been a bit of a drop off but do you think a lot of that is because of the the red cards or do you think something quite dramatic has changed this year yeah well I think I think it's it it doesn't help does it when you've had three red cards in in eight games um it's it's going to skew the the statistics a bit I mean against Leicester it was just two freak you know worldly goals from from James Justin not much you can do about that um I wonder if and James made this point last week that maybe they they do switch off a little bit against some of the the teams they kind of expect to beat because they've got so much of the ball because they're so in control you know if you're two it up maybe do just take your eye off the prize a little bit and I think we saw that in the first game against wolves wolves should have scored in in that match Villa was a tough game next but again I think Watkins miss an absolute sitter in that game so yeah I don't think it's it's really surprising that maybe they haven't hit the heights that we we thought given given that kind of start but at the same time no clean against Leicester Southampton and Bournemouth I know is is a concern especially when you go into the run that they're going on to now with Liverpool Newcastle and and then Chelsea um are you are you doubled up you doubled up on on Arsenal defense I'm not so I was going to and then we weren't sure whether Ry was going to play so I brought flein in and went with havitz havitz got me two goals in two weeks I was quite happy with that and now I've moved on from hav to salanki so no I wasn't and I think those people that went for double Arsenal defense it was the floor play it was the I'm expecting some clean sheets in this run which was a good decision but it's like I said it's been it's been paid off in the in the worst way really especially with the celba red card kind of yeah really rounding it off for a lot of managers there so I do think we've got to look at the data we're seeing at the moment and think that Arsenal aren't the elite defense we thought they were but Liverpool's the one that's most interesting to me in terms of maybe not a Trent because obviously he's expensive we got to try and get those premium mids but when you've got players like canate who look good good and kellerer who could potentially be in goal until December with reports that are coming out like they're not the worst players to potentially to invest in but I do want to see how they get on against an Arsenal and a villa and a city in the next five yeah I mean I'm I am doubled up on on Arsenal um I've got Gabrielle bench this week because obviously I can't bench bench re haven't got a backup obviously benching Gabrielle is a is a risky move given the given his his threat from from set pieces but I do want if we are going to see people pivoting to a double Liverpool defense because I know obviously there's there's jotter there's Diaz um there's Salah there's Trent there's you know there's there are decent picks there but if you're not going for Salah I can see why people aren't going for one of Josh oraz given the fact that they get benched and there's kind of rotation um around that obviously J's now got this little injury so I wonder if maybe it's it's Trent canate and then you leave the third spot open for for Salah I wonder if we're going to see people doing that when the pictures turn I'd be very surprised I'd be really really surprised if people went double Liverpool I mean I'd be surprised if people are even got one at the moment unless it's Trent and even then the majority of people I know that have Trent are thinking of selling him because he's just that cash cow that you need to move to those premium mids so I'd be very surprised I mean the fixtures I wouldn't say are really there the Brighton game's not too bad but Brighton can attack so I'm looking at those fixtures and thinking I don't think now is the time to be moving to it from 15 onwards yeah there's there's a case for it but I I would be very very surprised I think people are going to be moving off defense quite quickly and they're going to be pumping their money into Midfield because that's where it all is and we're going to get to a time from kind of 12 onwards when we're wanting sacka we're wanting son we're wanting um fod uh Palmer we're wanting you know all that Harland still potentially and I think I just don't see it personally I think we're kind of going back into the old days of make your defense as cheap as possible and pump everything into Midfield and Strikers which it did wouldn't it that's exactly what it used to be 4.5 million Defenders across the board so we'll see do have Trent well that's what I mean do you think Trent's going to be the sacrifice for this yeah I think so I I think it's just too easy a sacrifice to make in terms of you free up like three million by moving down from him and I and I think that's the the biggest thing that people are going to do and when you've got players like I said like eight Nori or I don't know mikeno that you can down to and they got nice fixtures I think people will do it yeah other end of the table the obvious ones I switch a bottom I think no surprises there Southampton and then Leicester all in and around two expected goals conceded every game clearly the teams to to Target Chelsea down in 17th I knew their defense had been bad but it has been really bad according to the stats yeah yeah it's interesting that one I mean the three at the bottom of the three you'd expect and obviously they've got some we've got some players with nice fixtures against them this week in in brenford and we've got um Man City obviously as well chelse is an interesting one and actually I think a lot of people didn't go for Sanchez because they thought he was going to lose his place but I don't hate the idea of Sanchez because they do concede a little bit of XGC if that makes sense but I would love to see how much his what's that stat was it XG prevented or something isn't it XGC prevented for Keepers I'd love to see where he is on that because he always looks he's got a cler in him but oh Andy let me let me let me get that up for you right now there you go at this there you [Laughter] go uh actually it is oh xgp is there uh it's yeah um it's one's four so it's not great yeah yeah well he's he's four for points per 90 um one is one ranks about one of one of the lowest um on on show I think Ray rayer and Leno actually the two lowest oh and pford actually pi at 2.3 Leno at 2.4 yeah no it's an interesting that obviously the two Liverpool boys being top if if we find out Allison is out for a little bit longer kellaher is going to be extremely popular um but yeah Onan is always going to be up there because we can see so many chances as well um but no I I was interested to see where Sanchez was on this but I don't think that it's it's tough with Chelsea because the fixtures aren't there for quite a while are they really you'd be looking to move in maybe 12 or 13 and again if you've got a a keeper that's is doing fine you're not going to be moving for one are you no I mean just just to just to kind of reiterate what this what this chart showing so um expected goal prevented just basically indicates how I think I I think it's the best metric of how well a goalkeeper's been performing um this season uh you can see Hanson is there at the top at 4.6 he's basically prevented nearly five goals with some of the saves that he's made Pope there at 3.1 Anana had a great start to the season uh 3.3 you wouldn't expect to see Rea in the minus so he's actually he's actually let in more goals than than he should have done um you know give what we seen from the Champions League when he's saving penalties and rebounds and and all that kind of thing um you know it's you wouldn't expect to see see it kind of reversed Allison at 2.7 so yeah there there's been some Keepers that have had strong starts the season basically very very very interesting though that fen's bottom one well not bottom but he's bottom of this list and minus 1.70 but he's got more save points than anybody else this season hasn't he yep he's made 42 saves and next best is Pope with oh no next best is Hanson with 40 and then it's Pope with 35 so that's quite interesting but um yeah obviously fen's also got the fixtures coming up you know I switch Bournemouth Leicester at home and he's got two nice away fixtures you'd be hoping for something in that run I would have thought yep uh let's look at some attacking data don't know if you like me I I think I probably trust the attacking data more than I trust the defensive data especially when you see teams like City and Villa at the top when what I see is is teams that can sort of play play quite well against them apart from obviously in the Champions League they're doing really well um Spurs are a topic that we're going to talk about bit more this episode I've got a table on some of their assets and they are top actually non 90 expect to score two goals a game with Chelsea second 1.86 and Man City just off that um 1.85 but Spurs players we've both got slanky how are you feeling about how are you feeling about that uh I mean he's going to be in and around the attack the thing that um is really interesting at the moment and I was listening to the above average pod and they were saying the same thing is that he seems to be doing that firmino role like firmino used to do for Liverpool where he does a lot of the work to make sure that the Wingers obviously get what they need to do and Madison kisi Brennan Johnson son seem to be thriving because they've got that Striker up front and you think they've had te o Vera richison and people like that for a little while since Kane's left and I think is what they've needed they've needed that player that's a bit selfless and will do that not great for FPL nobody ever really picked forino he did have those weeks where he did really well I think sank will still be fine but I think if you've got sank and he's your only attacking Spurs asset I think you probably want to try and get another one especially for you know this little run that they've got as well and the fact they in 11 and 13 they've got two Captain all fixtures my biggest thing is which one do you go for because I think if you were set me up so perfectly I know I know because look at this because son is the one that seems to be the explosive player that we've we've you know had an FPL before and he's the one that can hit those Heights and get you the braces hat tricks whatever it's going to be Brennan Johnson seems to be getting a ridiculous amount of chances inside the box and touches inside the box which it shows here but I've got such a soft spot for koseski like I I think he's creating so well at the moment but is he Captain a ball I I don't think he is so all roads kind of lead to son Madison the big thing this week was that he got taken off at halftime he was playing really well but they needed to change things and he was the one that went so I think all roads lead to on personally unless you need a cheaper option then I think you probably just go Brennan because the value is there interesting I see I think all roads lead to Brennan um with this I mean touch touches in the Box 64 um for for Brenan Johnson um interesting keski isn't isn't far off that with with 62 so you know having like 10 touches in the Box um a match essentially um I haven't fact checked this Mark Southern sent me he did also send me boer's um tweet to take it with a pinch of soul but he told me brenan's touches in the box is identical to harland's in terms of her so you think about parlan's position his average position and where he just stands or Johnson is getting that many touches in the box from from out from out wide yeah I know I I mean Brennan looks looks nailed now doesn't he I think he's going to be playing every game for them moving forward kisi I think is as well son we we've been told by Andre already that he's going to be managed this season he can't be playing every single game 90 minutes he's got to be managed a bit more so you would think that raras and verer are going to be coming on for son and maybe verer coming on for salanki so that koseski role I think I think between koseski and Brennan I think they're fine and they're obviously an awful lot cheaper as well I do have a soft spot for Koski but I just think son is there and he's the one you'd want to captain in 11 and 13 would you Captain Brennan Johnson in 11 and 11 in 11 or 13 against ipswitch will F him no I wouldn't but I'm not looking at I'm not really looking at alternative captains other than other than Harland at the moment I think if I think if Holland wasn't in the picture it would it might be it might be a bit different um who's Holland got in in third who City got in 13 is that the Brighton game city of Liverpool away oh okay yeah so you so you probably do need an extra Captain let's get the um let's get the ticker up hang on uh yeah so in 13 City have Liverpool obviously you've got that great Spurs game against Fulham I'm looking at Chelsea Chelsea with Villa at home that's not too bad either Arsenal with West Ham away I don't know would I rather have son than saaka or Palmer that's the thing that I keep coming back to I I just don't think I would yeah sacka is the one because I think sacka by the time you get to 12 if he's fit again which will most likely happen you're looking at sacka in 12 back because you're going to want to be getting on some of those Arsenal assets again potentially but I mean Palmer if you don't own Palmer now when do you think is the entry point when do you think I need to get him back in for that game you is the Leer one in 12 you have you have to get him in 12 don't you so if you're getting Lester if you're getting him in 12 and you need son for 13 because he looks the best captaincy option or a or Spurs when how are you going to own all these players by by well I I don't I don't think son I don't think son is is needed that I've said this from the start of the season it's it's probably going to come back and bite me when son's ends up to the top scorer in FPL or something like that but if I'm looking at son compared to saaka Palmer Salah Harland he's the fifth one for me out of those he's the one I'm I'm picking last and the Fulham game isn't it's not like Southampton at home or rip switch at home you know he's got him in 11 Harland has has Brighton where he will get chances against us believe me um so do I need to get do I need to get some full at home when when Palmer's got Villa at home I don't mind that for for Palmer and then Palmer's got him switching South Antony for side I think Palmer's got to be a mustone from 12 isn't he yeah I the more you look at it as well he's obviously in 12 he's got Leicester in 14 he's got Southampton the big thing for me with Palmer now is like and I mentioned this on scoutcast about five weeks ago is that he's one of the only players that can go really big anymore like I don't really when you look at other players and you think Harland obviously can Salah still has it in him but he's slowed down a little bit compared to what he used to be sacka doesn't massively go big I know he has what twice but you wouldn't expect it in a game week whereas Palmer against the right oppos position just goes mental and he's not playing in Europe I just think when you're looking at those fixtures it's not like you have to look and say yeah but he's he might play midweek he's not going to so I feel like Palmer from 12 is you know a musthave really so it's just when the rest of them come in but like you just said if you swerve son and you go for a koseski or a Brennan Johnson it means you can get on a sacker and a Palmer quite easily in 12 I guess the alternative is I mean you've got you've got J Johnson compared to um to son there about 3 million saving there you could go Jackson over Palmer there's going to be what a 4 million saving there no let's stop you could do I mean or you go havs over sacka right and that's that's your 1.5 million million saving I mean I was going to ask you which of those you think is actually a decent a decent tradeoff um I'm guessing it's not it's not Jackson it's not it's not either I don't think I don't think I want either over them um oh as as gone hello is it just me what's happened has as disappeared I have no idea whether it's just me hello I'm assuming this is just me I'm waiting for him to come back in rip as just you Andy cartel got him he mentioned too much oh he's back again do you know what this is one good thing though about streamyard is awful is is what I've learned from this this whole experience has been not because of you because we're having to wait we have to pause between each bloody thing so we can we can speak they were just talking to me it was lovely but at least one of us can like leave and come back in it doesn't kill the whole stream yeah true yeah yeah um yeah I was I was just saying uh you know if we are looking to save some money like where where can you go I mean foden to harland's the other one isn't it do you ever think foden is going to be a replacement for him no not at the moment no and I mean we we talked to Luke quite a bit and he's saying like there I we don't see a time at the moment where foden's going to be nailed on because that he's not going to play him on the wings and that Midfield three with gundan is obviously where he wants to go and he seems really scared of teams playing in Counterattack so it it doesn't look like there's going to be a fixture where you can say foden's definitely going to play even this week and I don't think foden's a good buy this week because a lot of people with foden are probably going to be moving off him in a couple of weeks so it's tough and it's a shame because you want them but I don't really feel like there's over a longer period of time I don't feel like you can compromise on sacka Palmer and Harland I just don't think you can whereas son could be one you compromise on um but yeah the others I just don't think they are of course they're all on penalties as well which is such a major factor too yeah I mean I've got I've got foden probably until gameweek 12 and then and then I'm probably going to be losing him for for Palmer in some way losing foden before Spurs at home though doesn't feel amazingly you know amazingly good if he play but that's the thing I mean you think that's going to be a case all season do you think foden's going to be a doubt All Season or you reckon he's eventually going to be straight he's going to be number one it's a shame I think he is I thought kdb being out I thought that kind of nailed him on but I think with rodri being out and gundan coming in and the fact that he's quite scared of that Midfield not really being secure enough against teams he seems to keep picking gundan who I don't think has been great since he's come back either and I I think it just means that foden ends up being the player that doesn't play and uh what Savio is great at the uh last night and so is Matas Nunes as well and I just think foden's being turned into little bit of a scapegoat and kind of not getting the minutes we're expecting and coupled with the fact that he's had a bit of an injury too it's meant that unfortunately one of those kind of explosive players from last year we're now having second outs about and it's not like we haven't got other options like I said you got saaka palas son and that's just naming three of them and then you've also got players like inmo so all of a sudden it just becomes foden is a bit more dispensable this season than he was last season it's got kind of mahrez Vibes hasn't it like when we all kind of thought mahrez was going to be first name on the team sheet when he'd been playing really well literally week after week after week he gets he gets benched I mean Mar has never won play of the Season like like foden did last year and it does seem surprising that he's potentially going that way but he has had history with pet before La last season was the blip for foden really because he he played pretty much every game before they yeah I know I know um and to be honest I thought that was it then but I think things have changed I think the rodri injury did shock it did shake them quite a lot as well you know to lose him for the whole season I think is massive for them um and I just think I've always said obviously with foden last year he was playing every game so it was absolutely fine and when Harland didn't play or De Bron didn't play he was he was another focal point which is awesome as well but I just think this year he's turned into a player that we're having doubts about every week and you don't want to invest in too many players you're having doubts about every week and like I said there's alternative so yeah I'll be getting rid of him for Palmer most likely yeah not this week obviously it'd be 12 yeah we're all saying that because Mark's in in the chat with ar and he's saying he doesn't feel confident about phone and kind of regrets buying him and wants to move elsewhere all three of us have got him and we're all feeling kind of same way but and remember as well we've got fent and Lewis so it's it's every week you're looking thinking if both of those are benched like that's a massive hit to your team and the upside hasn't been there yet so that's the other issue like but you know hopefully when he does play and if he plays this week we could be absolutely loving life and obviously he scored in champ league as well so we'll see what happens but he's not as certain as he was last year that's for sure yeah we've got a little bit sidetracked just to come back to the Spurs assets table I saw a question asking us to kind of rank these in order just to just for the podcast listeners um son comes out top on terms of points per per 90 7.1 and he's mentioned kazi's assist potential he's the highest on show out of Som brell and kvi Madison and sanki uh 3.4 pretty much Brennan's the one who's getting those shots away getting the shots in the Box he's having those touches um all in the area as well um slanky is having the best chances if you look at XG per shot non penalty 0.26 that's the highest so when he is getting an opportunity it's the highest XG um shot and he has had the most big chances as well with eight compared to Brenan six so he so sinki is still there I mean I'm not like you say when I watch him I'm kind of not that impressed but the stats don't make me think think he's an awful option I just think Brennan is probably the one I if you could offer me those if you offer me the swap for free I think I'd probably take you up on it yeah i' it's really interesed that though like salanki I think is fine because he's obviously that Striker position and when you're looking at Strikers I think Harland salanki wood seems to be the ideal three at the moment in terms of fixtures looking forward and form and things like that but that Midfield slot I think is actually quite tough son it's basically I'm fighting in the back of my head with keep it simple and simple as son because I can afford son and that's just keeping it simple he's the goal scorer but I do think Brennan and koseski at that discount you it can't be ignored basically and I do get what you're saying with Brennan Johnson I've just got this thing in my head that Brennan Johnson is g to revert to type soon but as kfy i' I've owned koseski before and he's done well but again he's got his issues where he's not really a goal scorer so I think I'll probably end up with son but Kulu is the one in the back of my head but are you going to Bren this week or are you is this just the one you'd pick if you could no I'm not actually um my my transfer yeah well I be interested to get your your take on on my transfer because I'm I'm doing these match of the day notes on on Twitter and you know the reason for that is I want to give myself a reason to watch match today because I I didn't watch it religiously last year and I had my worst ever season and I think I was watching a lot of live football but I think sometimes it's nice to get a bit more of a broader overview of what's of what's going on and I think match to day is really helpful because obviously they break down the tactics and you see you know players that you might not otherwise have seen or mentioned and I have to say the the player that I've been really impressed with um for a little while and particularly I thought against brenford was your was your mate garnacho oh your boy I thought he was unb I think he had eight shots in in that game uh against brenford I just think he's taken it a bit personally being benched in those first few few matches and there's always question marks around Manchester United and whether tar can get them you know playing any brand of football that doesn't rely on kind of individual Brilliance but he is a hell of a player isn't he gacho and the fixtures I mean again we're going to come back to the fixtures um graphic but the next five for Manchester United West Ham Chelsea Leicester IP switch Everton four of those five games against four of the weakest teams in the league well five if you include Chelsea's defensive you see exact so I there's been so many false dorms with United and it happens every season every season we got oh hang on they've started looking good again I will say that front three of rashford gacho and holand did look really really good and I think holand is the one that we've missed because xerx is not that type of player yeah I do think that looked really really good Bruno that assist was absolutely beautiful by the way and if anybody else did that we'd be talking about it for ages but I do think na would be the one to own especially if he continues to play on the left and I think for the fixtures we've got coming up especially after this week I think West Ham's fine but the fact that we've then got um Leicester at home Everton at home and we got I switch away I think they are investable in but it's who are you buying him instead of and if you're buying him instead of a Spurs asset I don't think I'd do that I think I'd want a piece of that Spurs pie basically and then I think you could probably wait until 11 basically because I don't think you'd invest ahead of Chelsea even though their XGC is so low I don't think you would so I think you'd probably be waiting till 11 but from 11 onwards I think a gun at is not that bad we could even see a rashford Resurgence which you know he was about 80% owned at one point after Co wasn't he so um yeah I've just I'm used to this with United there's been so many false Dawns and you think you're getting in there early and you just end up going at the wrong time so yeah but garache would be the one I think yeah I mean I've already got salanki I mean I could double up on it as a SP I mean that's what Mark's doing he's got slanky he's already moved for for Johnson he's going one step further and buying a player we haven't even mentioned from Spurs which is porro as well bringing in por yeah bringing in por this this week so he's going really hard um on Spurs I think I'm gonna I'm gonna pivot away from it and and have a bit of a punt on gacho I had him last season I kind of feel like he owes me I benched him for for two braces last season yes I remember that yeah which uh he was cheap as chips last year wasn't he he was was he he's five million was I think I got at 49 something like that and again it's really stupid but playing a 49 asset feels rough playing a 6.2 asset feels a bit better even though it's the same player uh it's just kind of how how a feel Works um this is a new graph that um graph chart that that marks put together this is so the this is um game we nine xgi of course game week eight xgi so this is um xgi just for the game week and I think again this this goes quite nicely with like talking about match of the day and highlights and what you see from individual game weeks obviously we we look at the stats we look at like a longterm View and you know last six game weeks is typically what we look at also can we to see who were the kind of the the top um performers in in individual game week um I mentioned gacho's shots he's not in the top 30 that I could see for xgi non- penalty so they weren't exactly great chances but he was having a lot of them Brenan not though I wanted to talk about playing for Leicester he's at the top of this 1.5 I was really impressed with him um this week haven't been since he signed for Leicester he he's looked all right for briyan when I've seen him play he's come with a big reputation I think TZ said he was going to be the next liel Messi which is little bit of hype to to live up to um hasn't really delivered I don't think Brighton ever really knew what his best position was tried to put him on the right hasn't really got the pace for that we had a lot of players who could play in the 10 um but yeah really really delivering at at Leicester um yeah what your thoughts on him yeah I don't hate him at all I think he's he's playing all right I think um Leicester fixtures what they got Forest not great potentially but then ipswitch and then from 13 onwards it looks a little bit Rosier so I don't hate him as a pick I you know I play so rare I've got him in that and he's absolutely killed it in that in the last couple of weeks so I'm very happy there it's just I think we've got other players that are cheap options to say like are you basically going to go with a bonon not or are you going to go with a Rogers I think is the the comparison because you're not going to want more than won midfielder at 5 million um and obviously Rogers has been the absolute bargain so far this season and I think stop it stop it I'm not too I'm not totally sure about that I think that I think can well I mean if you we look at some of the players on this list Midfield is around five million so you've got Buon not okay he's probably not too many people going there but I think he's a he's a decent option um seeno is on here at 56 two rough games fixtures on exactly two rough games but you get through those and then it's it's a decent run um do you think Smith row is now just not not a consideration for us at F I'm I mentioned that so on scoutcast two weeks ago hibbo and um uh nacho were saying oh Smith row is still a good and I was thinking I don't know whether he is anymore I I I I would much rather have a Rogers over him um I'd much rather have a bonon not potentially although like I said the fixtures maybe aren't there enough for me but I I still think Rogers is the one if I was wild card and Rogers would be on it 100% and then you've got Patrick Flor saying no mcneel I think McNeil's an option at 56 with the fixures they've got I love McNeil AB Rutter at Brighton yeah is Welbeck still out well um Herzel has said that he it sounded really painful he said he'd like knocked a nerve in his back or something like that and he was still in quite a lot of pain I'd be very very surprised if he um if he started against walls um Ferguson played 60 minutes I'm not sure he's got a bit of a knock as well but it it could be rter up front if if Ferguson and Welbeck are both out we might see rter up top not sure who'll then play at the 10 maybe gruda comes in at 10 um or they push like a bber up to to that role but yeah I think Rutter's looking like you know we paid 40 billion for him it raised a lot of eyebrows he's looking like a good player for us do you know um the one player I'm going to mention and this is my like my differential I think he's like 3% owned oh is uh is dams guard for brenford he's on set piece is he's looked good he's got three assists in his last two games I think he's someone especially with their fixtures coming up as well what they got IP switch Bournemouth Lester all at home you could you're gonna be wanting to play him potentially I think if you could have a double up with him and aumo and then have those three premiums I I quite like that so damar's my little uh one he's not actually on this is he but he's um he's one that I'm gonna tip moving forward okay okay well um in the sleeper draft the wire have got Dam's guard and I know I know zal was was talking up on on the video they did today so I think they probably agree agree with you on that um two more players I wanted to mention on this list I mean one of them you own already Chris Wood 0.91 seven points um for him gimenez Ral gimenez 5.7 million next 0.74 if we jump ahead and we come to the the forwards um table um both are uh where are they on this list so where wood is 17th I saw them earlier wood is 17th and Jimenez I don't think is Jimenez is eighth on this say .63 for him um and and wood at .39 I mean Wood's expected gold per 90 is pretty low isn't it at .39 that's the first thing I saw I mean 78% accuracy and 31% conversion surely that's not sustainable surely I think he looked good he could have got more on Monday night I I genuinely I think he is he is such a good option if I was wild card in this week I am almost certain I would have Chris Wood in my team if I was wild card in after this week I might move to somebody else maybe like a CA or Al Larson because I think they might start coming into teams with wolves's fixtures obviously changing and I think there's going to be a bit of an uptick there but I think Wood's fine I feel I feel like if you've got wood now he um if you've got wood now you're going to keep him and you're going to be more than happy with the fact that you've got him but if you don't he is going to be the player that you do not move to every week and he's just going to keep it there's always a striker like this always a striker I swear every season that does this and he's just going to be that one where people are like no he won't carry it on and he'll just keep plooding away I reckon it's funny is it because at start of the Season everyone's saying not only is he is he not GNA is he not going to do that well but he's not going to play because alanai is going to come back and you know take his place that I mean that has just been put completely to B Nuno really likes him I think he really likes what he brings the side and he's almost built I mean it's a prettyy exciting attack with Hudson Ado Gibs white and elanga but it's all about yeah I mean Anderson was Unreal yeah absolutely unreal so it's like a like a man City Light you know instead of Harland up top they've got chriswood Christ is this just you trying to bring mark back next week saying all the lovely things about him I wood has been Mark Mark has got it wrong about wood he was pretty pretty anti- him in the start of the season and uh yeah I think he he always thought that Tyra would have eventually come back and and take him but yeah hasn't done so um I we're on borrow time with you now we're we're six minutes past eight you've got a a Tesco delivery arriving any minute it'll be coming any minute mate bit of I know it's like this it's all the track can talk about but it'll be here in a minute I would have thought well before let's um there's still some stuff I can cover obviously I can I can carry on when when you're gone um but let's Jump Ahead quickly just to your team for the week in case you do have to jump out I'm sure people will be desperate to know what your what your plans are al they can watch them on the Scout cast I doubt they've changed uh too much but yeah this is your team read out for the the podcast thiss and tell us what you're what you're thinking yeah so I got flecken in goal IP switch at home uh Gabrielle Pedro porro uh Rico Lewis foden and bumo uh Rogers sacka who is yellow flagged at the moment and then salanki Harland and wood up top with Harland as my captain minkovich first on my bench seeno and Greaves don't know where that injury came from but Greaves is out for about four weeks unfortunately and valdar s's my on the bench um I am pretty happy with this team this week I think this team looks fine this week I've already got that triple up with with City I've got double up with brenford which is in buan fleen but you know it's a pretty good fixture there my main move I'm looking at this week is sacka out um and it will be for a Spurs mid it's just which mid I go for basically I think I'll just end up going son but I am very very tempted to save the money and then move from foden up to Palmer got money in the bank so I've got 1.7 in the bank uh so I can move sacka to anybody I could even go to Palmer now if I wanted to but I think I will go for a Spurs mid it's just which one I go for basically but your voice then I know I don't know what happened SPS mid um but the one thing I will say is I don't really want to move down from sacka and then spread the funds I want to keep those price points because I want those two premiums in Midfield so I don't want to mess it around too much but sacka will most probably be going out I I have no idea whether he's going to play this week and even if he does I don't expect a lot from Arsenal in that fixture I think that is as tough a fixture as it's going to get for them so yeah I'm pretty sure that's what I'm going to do it's between son and koseski I think sorry because you and Mark are both going to be trebled on on Spurs and that just isn't really something that I would would consider I I don't fully trust them I know their attacks been good but they went down against against West Ham they've you know they threw away a two- goal lead against us they were awful in the second half against Leicester in in the first game they seem to have really good spells and they're not so good spells they're not they're not a very reliable team for for a triple up on potentially but then they were top of the XGC they were top of XG on your table and I look at it and just think with those two fixtures coming up in 11 and 13 to have that triple Spurs and potentially the captain one of them as well those are the kind of games where you can get massive games and I just think yeah why not go for a triple up Captain one of them and if it hits you're flying and I think that's the kind of thing I quite like at the moment I've done it with City I went early on foden which actually I'm quite happy I did because otherwise I'd be second guessing whether to go for him now so the fact I've got triple City this week this is the week where I'm hoping to you know hit big with them as well so I think you can do that every now and again and this is what I've wanted to do so I'm pretty sure I'm going to do it okay no man united players for a good run you Faith oh yes maybe maybe a gun out show but I I it's tough moving him in with all those other players I want yeah uh I'll show you my team the the order of this this stream has gone completely out out of the window technical issues stream out the window you're off to do a s a Tesco delivery yeah it's all it's all Carnage uh this is my team uh it's raying goal with Trent Lewis and and Moreno I'm playing him tomorrow uh against against Lester away foden and bumo seeno Rogers Harland Watkins and sanki up top Ward Gabrielle Davis and dibling on the bench yeah I mean I I could do smeno to Johnson I've got the money to do it but I think I'm going to take the punt on garnacho as I said I like it just something a bit different I think he's like eight% owned something like that um I remind you this in two weeks yeah I know I know and all the people on these yeah all these people the on the video as hat United he's never going to bring in United player and all that it's like yeah well that'll shut you up when I have one in my team would it I'm play every are you going to are you going to wait till the last minute and get the lead before you get gacha in or are you yeah I'll see what comes through in the cartel WhatsApp group and you know make make the decision on on that I will be hoping for a leak on Moreno because you know there's always a chance he could miss out for I'm assuming my request to join the cartel is still pending on the pending pending yeah you're not you're not actually a patreon member yet so that's true give us your give us your eight quid a month whatever it is and then you can cool I see what I can do um big question though Andy the big question that we haven't even covered yet and it doesn't show it on this graphic but it is currently active on my actual FPL team triple Captain any any consideration for it no no literally none at all no I I I I just don't think I would ever play it in a single game week just really don't think I would I the fixture is there and obviously the people that did it against dip switch and you got the hattick 17 points times three lovely but double game week you you know you only have to get a goal in each game and Max bonus and and you're beating that so I I will not be doing it this week and I I would be absolutely shocked if I did it in a single game week in any season I don't even know what the double game weeks are going to be but it could be that I don't go with harl it could be I put it on Salah could be I put it on someone else you know Palmer potentially so no I I 100% won't be doing it but little birdie tells me you might be I'm about I'm 6040 in favor of of playing it I'm I'm I'm a bit annoyed with myself I didn't play you know on him against IP switch because obviously Mark and I did the match of day challenge Mark didn't own Harland it would have been fun to have gone into that challenge with him with all triple Captain I did have it on him very briefly and then I took it off and I thought it's a bit too early for that like game week was it game week three um was it game week two was game week two wasn't it against against Z switch I just thought that was a little bit early um my reasoning for thinking about it now is that I've seen Southampton play and I I I I can't remember too many teams who play as badly in defense as as they've done I mean it's it's the perfect blend of you know a manager who isn't changing his um philosophy and in some ways you know fair enough that's how they got promoted he doesn't want to change but do you need to adapt a little bit to to the Premier League well it doesn't look like Martin's done that at all is individual mistakes from The Defenders and it's just an overall real lack of quality in that Southampton team yeah like ramale was a good signing for them you know he he's not a a bottom three goalkeeper obviously but that defense that Midfield the fact they've not really got any like out ball to a to a stri and I know they've got Archer but you almost want them to have a big man up top that they could you know at least a leave bit pressure and win the ball high up and hold it up they don't really seem to have that I just don't know how it can happen that City don't score multiple goals against them at the weekend what's your um expectation on minutes by the way my uh my the door's just gone so I've gotta go that's it you're GNA go pleasure as always thank you guys I had a I had a message lined up for that and he needs to go put his Petty Fu away this is the first time I've ever done a a proper episode of ffi Black Box um on my own and obviously I did the team selections last season but haven't actually done them on my own so yeah I thought I could just carry on for a little bit I've got a couple more charts go through the predictions um can answer some questions and things that that people might have obviously it's just me if you don't like listening to me then probably best you you drop off um because I'm G to watch the the numbers go go down crazily but yeah if you if you want to stick around and you know we can we could do another half an hour or so um then then let's go for it uh I do need another beer though should I grab that now should grab that in a bit not too sure anyway uh let's carry on for for a little bit more uh let's talk about some of the other um tables that we've that we've got so let's go through the main one so this is Defenders over the season you saw on my team earlier that I had Leaf Davis at the uh in the starting 11 he's actually third for exped gold 90 at .24 the question marks are around who's going to score the chances that he's he creating he's very much a creator of chances uh you know shots per 90 when you compare that to to Trent is half you to porro two it's a lot a lot lower than that um but the the Chan he creating is is really high 2.5 is the highest it's now higher than Trent um I think he was second going into into the league obviously Trent had a had a difficult game um but um yeah Davis is is creating chances a reasonable rate there's just no one that can really um has grab the bill we right yeah we'll do okay I do do Defender tables then I'll go grab grab a beer um so yeah I do like Davis I just don't know and Mark said this on the video he did early in the week the let's walk fbl um is it enough you know to be creating chances when there's not really anyone who can who can put them away and I think we've spoken about fors we've spoken about himz and kuna and stran Larson I think dap was big flavor of the month going into the Everton game and now it's it's massively gone down um to to some of the others so yeah we we'll see kind of how we switch bounce back from you know pretty bad losses I mean to lose that heavily to West Ham and then to lose to Everton in that manner um I think McKenna is going to be worried you they come out of a bad run they want to start getting points on the board um and then it's a bit of an issue so yeah he's he's still in my team but I don't think I'm gon to be playing him for the um for theable um I mentioned porro marks bringing him in uh this week you know nine goals conceded is obviously the problem he hasn't really had the attacking returns he got that goalen game week one not anything else yet I thought L really impressive in the West Ham game getting full um a lot I do wonder if Brennan cutting in means porro goes out a bit wider uh means that he's not really getting as close to goal as he maybe was last season um but you know he's still getting chance he's still getting opportun he had that shot near the end which was absolutely awful but it was from kind of the right the right kind of area uh so yeah I think he's he's a decent option I mean this week I I play I played Davis over Moreno and I I do wonder if it is like a clean sheet first policy that we kind of need to adapt with Defenders I think particularly this season when the bonus doesn't really favor attacking Defenders the bonus really does favor the clean sheets um you clean sheet for a Defender you know we sort of I think it was Murillo Sals um did AA get a bonus in that in that Forest game maybe maybe not um but yeah it's the you know it's taking multiple attacking returns almost for Defenders to get something uh from it so yeah a bit of a bit of a concern I'm not I'm not totally sold on on PO I think five5 is a bit too much for him but yeah if you've got him I hold him I don't think I'd be I'll be buying him is there any else on this list that really inspires um I'm not totally sure there is I think minkovich is a good shout if you've got him he's 20th on this list um he has an assist I think he got that the week before last um I think he's he's probably the the stand out in in that in that bracket I don't mind Anor either but those fullbacks don't really seem to be getting forward a lot too much so I think milinkovic would be the one if you're looking to tap into to Forest nor 13 two goals two assists not point2 exra P maybe expecting that to be a little bit higher given the attacking returns that he's got maybe suggest that he's been a little bit lucky uh but I think he's gonna be pretty popular obviously Brighton are gonna thrash him this this week so don't buy him yet but going forward the the fixures are pretty decent um for them couple more that we flagged here we got Manning at Southampton um you know climbing up kind of the thing look at his Chan to created for 90 in the top 10 that's why we're featuring him uh vanderberg in 4 not sure what happens with Rico Henry when he's back but 4 million I think vanderberg is probably the one to go for and you got moleno really popular seven points and from himly Keane got the got the big hole but mikeno didn't do B mikeno didn't do badly 89th on the list though it doesn't really look like you're going to get much from these Everton Defenders so you've really got to hope for those one nil wins that we know D is is capable of um but again if you got him at 4 five he he's probably a bit of a keep so there's some decent option defense there's no one that really kind of I don't think anyone's really a mustone you know Trent and Gabrielle obious got the tough fixtures um Lewis is a hold but isn't really getting the clean clean sheets I think his minutes are pretty safe I think Walker's uh kind of being phased out a little bit um maybe it's a bit of a shame that Stones has made a bit of resurgence because he can obviously play uh kind of in in that kind of inverted role but I'm hoping that Lewis Lewis carries on um vel's 18th going to pay a little bit more for him two goals in the last couple of games he's obviously a good pick as well but no one really you know I think we we said this a lot last season um about Defenders not really having too many standouts I think we're kind of getting that again uh this year so when I've got Trent um who have I got I've got Trent Gabrielle they're okay I've got Lewis I'm reasonably happy with I've got Moreno I mean that could be any not KN Forest Defender I'm pretty happy with those going forward so yeah not not looking to make any defensive moves uh in the in the near future um right I'm going to grab a beer I'm going to stick the stting soon back on um no technical issues I'm hoping at this stage it's a bit annoying with Andy we're a little bit delayed so thanks for for sticking around um a couple of people have left with it just me but still 770 people watching uh again we're caring for about another half an hour or so so I'm going to grab a beer and I will see you all in about five minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] I am back and what is better than one beer sure you know the answer oh it's two beers there we go thanks for sticking around everyone still 700 people watching this which is amazing if you uh I know it's a Thursday night but if you fancy grabbing a alcoholic or a non-alcoholic drink and joining me as we just rattle through the rest of these tables that'd be great Andy is is obviously getting his his Tesco delivery um and then he has got his community thing where he does that kind of educational uh I'd like to think it's like a seminar that he does so yeah if you're if you've enjoyed listening to Andy tonight he's always great to have on on standby for these things um then yeah check out his his community and get involved in that right let's have a look at the mids to cheeky hazy James absolutely I don't like brog as a company you know there's all the kind of problems the owner has had in the past and uh yeah I'm I'm not a big fan of how they how they operate but unfortunately they do make a pretty decent beer and I'm a bit of a sellout so yeah that's where that's where we're at uh right let's look at midfielders Jak's shaking in the background he all right it's fine midfielders then so I mentioned garnacho um he doesn't really feature well um on on the the list for the the last the last we show which was on the the XG for the game week um he's showing up highly though on here he's 13th on the list .57 X non penalty for 90 I always say around 0.6 is your kind of like Elite uh Elite numbers if you if you've got a player who's consistently getting around 0.6x non for 90 I said that that puts him in a pretty good position when you consider the fact he's 6.2 million um as well I think that's really nice inter that is identical to seeno who I would be selling for him the amount of shots seeno has um is is crazy um he does have some from from outside the air I think he's had the most shots of all midfielders which isn't kind of shown on on this on this table but in terms of those shots in the Box for 90 2.97 um ranks him to just below Salah 2.98 look at BR though 3.88 that's the highest of all of all midfielders but yeah garnacho 2.69 decent touches in the Box per 90 7.37 for him that's higher than S think just making some hacking nois in the background that's nice I've Disturbed he was fast asleeping so went and got these um got these beers uh so yeah it maybe feels a little bit sideways doing that doing that seeno toono move it's Villa away next for Simo then it's Man City I think he could get some joy in those I really don't think you know selling is is a if you were going to keep him I wouldn't say it's a terrible move let's put it that way I'm just trying to tap into those slightly better fixures for for and he's a player that I just genuinely really like and I'm not seeing him many teams so there's a few reasons there um to get rid of him um Savio is fifth on this list I think he's an interesting one as well if you are looking to go for someone a bit different in the Man City attack um I thought he played brilliantly in the Champions League uh last night he's looked good in the games that I've I've seen him play obviously he was amazing for Jona last year that's why city of the ball I don't think we've seen that kind of player from him in terms of that kind of output if you look at some of these numbers look at those touches in the Box per 90 uh 9.92 that's kind of in the top five for midfielders the ex 9 is really high as I mentioned .71 um and yeah I wonder when his that that right hand spot of the city team really does feel up for grabs and he's clearly got hell of a lot of talent so I think it's going to be sooner rather than later we see him see him break in the trouble is do you weigh or do you take a punt on it for this Southampton game I think again he's someone that's that's flying under the radar he might even be some I was considering but I'm I'm already tripled up with Lewis foden and and Harland um someone to consider malison SATs a great on in .85 EX on 90 but Andy mentioned his early sub I think that's a bit of a concern when the players going off halftime uh poo KLU said they weren't really controlling the game which is rare for him to to say that I think he's said in the past that he doesn't care about how much they control it as long as they they score goals and get the win but they need to do something to get a handle on that West Ham game and it was definitely that sub that that changed things around um and and KF kind of impact that he had I think after that sub was was made so I think he he's now a bit too risky and obviously we've already talked about the the Spurs players um I still think Johnson is the one to go for um but I don't blame people for for going for son because we know what his pedigree is like it's just that it's just that sanky role we give him a couple of weeks s does but if he's blanked again in the next couple he's going to be someone that we that we look to take out um I don't think it's fair to talk about midfielders though without talking about Morgan Rogers at 5 million at the start of the Season he's not showing up on these stats you know you have to go down to 4 first to find him .38 he's not in the top 10 for touching the Box he's not in the top 10 for chances created his points per 90 is 4.47 it's decent but it's not kind of crazy this is where I think watching games having a bit of you know making sure you're watching different teams not just your team when they're they're on TV um and using the eye test is is really clear because Rogers to me is is looking like he could be one of the if he made team of the season the way he's playing at the moment um I don't think anyone would be would be too surprised he is so key to everything Aston Villa are trying to build whether it's in Europe and he was I think he was man of the match in in the game the other night um every game I've seen him play he's demanding the ball he's making the runs his end product is maybe lacking a little bit and I think if he starts adding those goals to his game what is his potential um you know for five Milli he's never going to be a Palmer we're never going to have a Palmer again I don't think at five million um but if Rogers goes on and could get you know 170 180 points and really kick on from where he is now he's goingon to go down as one of the best value picks of all time and I think that's more likely that trajectory for him um than you know he gets phased out and doesn't really become a an impact for us so if you're listening to this and you haven't got Rogers um you're always going to have kind of other priorities maybe to go for you know the big hitters and the moving around but when it comes to saving money and you want to bring some money out of maybe some of the other other midfielders even if the pictures aren't that good I still would suggest that you you take a look at Rogers um because yeah I I just think he's he's he's an absolutely unreal player and and I wonder how long it's goingon to be to gets caught up for England um I mean surely he's got to be T's got to be looking at that and thinking he's a player that can offer us something a little bit different because if you think about de Bry for City and the way he can get the ball in Midfield and just drive forward um we need more players like that in the in the England squad um from that kind of central role that maybe hunt foden because foden has never delivered for England so yeah Rogers had to had to mention him the other player I wanted to mention here just move on is um Fatu as well of Leicester thought he changed the game when he came on um against Southampton um I know Harry's got madidi he's I saw his his his podcast where he was kind of wondering why he's he's got him I don't think he was a bad pick at all I was tempted to go there kind of at the start of the Season obviously there's now other five five five options who are looking a bit better um but you know with Jamie vardy with madidi and with fatua they've got some real players that can hurt teams um and again he's not one you're gonna buy now but I think he's he's someone to watch because he's got that kind of explosiveness in him where over this run of games Lester have got once we see him naed in that team I do wonder if he could present a bit of an interesting alternative um but yeah we'll have to wait and see a little bit on him uh forwards so this is the interesting position I'm stacked in my my forward spot I've got harand 15 million uh for him 10 goals three consecutive blanks but the stats are just absolutely obscene as they always will be um over the season um it's more of a blip isn't it we we've already seen the Champions League he's gonna um he's he's he's going to revert back to to form pretty soon I've got Watkins who I know you know quite a few people maybe have maybe Bend off in the last few weeks he's been doing well for me there is some concerns that he's getting benched a bit earlier than you'd like 65 70 minutes uh he did um was benched in the Champions League game as well Duran got his sure it's not his first start is it maybe I think it is his first other than other than the cup um but uh yeah we we imagine Watkins is going to come back in good game against Bournemouth then it's away at Spurs as well I don't really hate even those fixures for him then it's probably a case of moving him on to to a Palmer when those fixtures turn around so yeah harand slanky and um and and Watkins I'm pretty stacked up top I do think I'm missing a bit of a trick with some of the the cheaper um forwards we've mentioned quite a few of these already I think Jimenez is the standout for me um four goals and assists for him he's in that kind of Purple Patch era that he was he was in before obviously his awful head injury um he's an incredible player all his day f are playing well um you know eight points per 90 for someone that costs 5.7 million is is just an absolute bargain so I think if you are considering one of these cheaper Strikers he's probably the one to go for I think we rule out Cal lein I know the fix is good he can't score you've got to be able to score and he can't um we look at we look at COA as well given the fixures have turned around for him the importance that he's got in that side I don't mind that I don't mind strand Larson if you want to go down even further and save a bit of money I wonder if the ship sailed a little bit on chriswood um given the fixtures I think he should do all right against against Leicester I would back him to score um in that um it's just from that um the fixtures aren't great I mean if he does score against against Lee he's going to be really popular given his given his price um to be fair it's West Ham and Newcastle it's not a bad Run is it then if switch in 13 I take it back he's I reckon he's probably still a good pick up even after even after Leicester but yeah Leicester West Ham and Newcastle then ni switch in 13 is he better than gimenez know let me think let me let me know would you rather go Jimenez or uh or wood um go M forward probably is actually quite close between them isn't it I think I'd go those two overa for some reason I thought wood had um like really tough games coming up but he's other that Arsenal game they they all look pretty decent so yeah he's uh he's definitely a consideration the stats aren't aren aren't too great um other than that not really a huge amount of options is there isack was someone I thought could end up being in our teams all season obviously that injury was it going to take for him to become a bit of a consideration uh for us probably quite a lot V's back in contention for brenford the fixures aren't bad for him either .77 ex with 90 was obviously very popular before the injury that he had again I think there's probably better options in there and what's happened with Mata I mean I owned Mata earlier in the season I got that brace from him we're all talking about uh you know the the fact that he was it the second most go goal since glasner took over um you know but yeah obviously unceremoniously dropped and and getu is getting the nod so I wonder know how long that's going to go on for I don't think Mata can be too happy when when Palace aren't scoring goals and he's been dropped and he's being such a key man for them trigger lips is in the chat he ask who I'm talking to that's a good question trick I I do often wonder that as well I'm just here talking to myself pretty much as yeah as uh actually the views have gone up to 705 yeah thanks for all uh sticking with me and and cheers I've kind of missed these these solo streams there's something there's something a little bit they're kind of relaxing in the way

crypto which I feel a bit funny about in nfts he's I mean he's really enjoying that um too fan team is something that I've played um which obviously has the gambling element again it's not something we'd ever promote on on blackbox um because I know the the gambling side of things and how it affects people um so yeah that's just my little speech on that see of I've been a really good sponsor for us so so yeah do check them out if you're if you're interested uh fixures though look we've got a new graphic and again I want to give a shout out to I mean honestly so much of what we do on blackbox comes from the viewers and the people that that watch this I mean the patreon WhatsApp group that we've got is absolutely incredible and the Discord channel is is growing and I love interacting with people on that um Ed's brother um Ed from Scout his brother's has done like the the intro video for us which we love we've had other people do the graphics FB poker playay has done the sound for us and now we've got Le and Liv doing things like the prediction website that we've got which if you're a Godfather team member you can track all the predictions that you're um that you're putting in and see how you kind of compare to others obviously they built us this graphic so Mark and I can track our predictions and enter them in um you know where would we be without the kind of community and it's been a bit of a tough week for me in the community this week um for anyone that's kind of following that um but there's so much of it that I that I you know I still love and still enjoy um so yeah do uh yeah just want to say thanks for anyone who's who's helped out Mark and I because yeah it does it does mean a lot to us um just someone's point out they're not in order which is BR W stop Chris yeah this was something that I learned from James last week that the games that so the three o'clock games for example are in alphabetical order so it would be Aston Villa uh brenford Brighton Man City it's just not something I'd ever thought about but yeah it is weird them not being it's that does this so Lee if if you're watching this from Australia make sure these are now best CL or people are going to start kicking off let's Ratt through these though it's ler Forest tomorrow night I'm playing Moreno I don't feel too good about it I think Forest probably win this game I think Wood's gonna get something out of it as well but I think Leicester scor they scored in every match so far it's a great comeback against Southampton uh too um but I think Forest have just got a bit about them at the moment I think they're defense is is nice I like minkovich and I like Murillo SS is actually looking like a decent goalkeeper uh now too um they've got you know good attacking options they've they've kind of built the team around getting wood service and yeah I think they'll they'll won this one out I do think leer are picking up though um I'd kind of written them off maybe at the start of the season but yeah I think they've got options and I think out of the three promoted teams they're by far the most likely to to stay up uh Man City Southampton this is going to be a blood bath surely I've gone for a 4-0 so as Mark um I have harand trible Captain in my team uh currently I think they they score multiple goals I think southampt are going obviously try and low block but I also don't think they're going to change their philosophy passing around the back I unless they completely change the way um they they play I think they're still going to try and kick it around and try and find a bit of space I don't think they've got a good out ball to get the ball to and I think City going to exploit it with the pressure that they've got and the players they've got I I just think it's going to be a really really tough day for Southampton so 4-0 hopefully some foden and Lewis involved but but harand uh getting all four of those goals would be lovely uh Brighton wolves I think we win this and if you remember mata's uh solo goal he scored last season one of the best goals I think I've ever seen great for a repeat on that um I was really impressed with Brighton um given that we had players come out for international break we had like M injured wck went off injured you know we had we've had Pro we've had like thumpings from from Chelsea we've recovered it's been a really exciting season already for us um I'm really impressed with r I think he's a he's a real differential if you're looking for someone completely different for a onewe punt and I think we'll have a bit too much for for wolves but I like wolves and I want to see them start getting some points that they that they deserve so I've gone for I've gone for two one here and it's it's a 31 for for Mark uh brenford IP switch Greaves is out I think this could be a big win for brenford again again I quite like it switch so maybe I've gone a little bit a little bit lower than maybe I should have done two-nil for them uh Mark's gone for a 3-0 inmo should come out of this with something good obviously got the brace against Southampton and the fellow promoted team um I think he could do very well in this one so if you haven't got inmo I think if I you know harland's obviously the biggest concern if you haven't got him but I think B's got to be up there right I'm expecting him to to come away from this with a with a double digit uh Villa Bournemouth very impressed with Bournemouth so far this season I think that defeat against Leicester was was really surprising but in other games um they they've looked really good um I've gone for two-nil Villa and this one though they're another team I just think they'll they'll get the win in this and looking at those defensive numbers surely at some point um the the clean sheets are are going to come marks given Bournemouth a goal in this a two-nil for Villa with Rogers and Watkins would be lovely as basically the dream result for me last time with with both of them scoring this a shame Rogers seems to get booked every time he he scores or it would have been a a bigger Hall uh Everton fham I've gone for a 2-1 fulam Mark's gone for a 1-1 see there's a bit about Everton at the moment start pick up a couple of wins a couple of clean sheets in the last two games two I just think the form of himz with Smith row supplying is going to be enough to see them through on this I think we might start regretting selling Smith row I know a lot of us have done if youve still got him I think he's still a perfectly fine hold to have in your team um so yeah I'm backing F him in this one uh West Ham man united I think of all the teams I've been least impressed with this season Southampton um probably bottom of my list um and then West Ham close to Second bottom I I just think they're so easy to play against like you look at the space they were allowing Spurs to have in that game why aren't they packing the Midfield why aren't they making attempts to try and stifle like creative players like kazki was just given license just to completely run the show um very strange and it's not the first time we've seen them do that against Chelsea I thought they were really poor as well I think ipswitch really flattered them um the way he switch played and approached that game I just think it's not a great it's not a great time um for them at the moment and I know Man United playing tonight there a bit about them with' hiling back we've gone at you in the fores in um so I'm backing them to to get that to get that one if there was a garden center game and that's what JS says I think it probably is the West Ham Man United game though isn't it I I wouldn't be canceling my plans to uh to you know to watch that one uh Palace Spurs I've gone for two1 Spurs Mar's gone for 3-0 Spurs I think if if Spurs were to win this 3-0 I think glar is going to start fearing for his job which seems unheard of after the end of the season they had last time out 3-0 no slanky no Johnson and no uh no porro involvement I think that would be pretty pretty unlikely I think this is the game we start seeing some some points for Johnson and sanki I think both are good picks going into this um Palace fans might start turning on their players a little bit you just never really know what you're going to get with with spur so if Palace if Palace score I don't think it's going to be too surprising Chelsea Newcastle I'm really really jealous of Palmer uh you know this week um he's someone that I really want in my team I look him every week and and think he's he's got great potential he's getting one assist and getting bonus I thought he played really well against Liverpool um as well I can't see any way he doesn't get something from this game haven't been impress with Newcastle they got the clean sheet against um Everton away but other than that they very very rarely keep away clean sheets um and Chelsea are doing very well on the um the expected goal involvement table for teams so I'm backing Chelsea to win this I wouldn't be surprised if pmer had a a a same both of these goals and comes away with a big ho so definitely consider um yeah definitely consider of bringing him in if if you don't already uh and then Arsenal Liverpool interesting game no celba um for Arsenal Liverpool looking really strong going to be a hell of an atmosphere at the Emirates um for this one I think a draw is probably the most likely given that new team is going to want to lose this one I think we have to consider Liverpool as a title Contender this year along with Arsenal along with Man City it's going to be those three um right at the top um so yeah I think I think Arsenal will take a draw in this given that cba's out um Liverpool will probably be hoping they can they can create a few problems for arsenal when then get something Mark's actually gone for 2-1 uh in this um for Liverpool so yeah we can see kind of how that how that one goes um I mentioned the prediction standings you can get involved in this if you're blackbox uh Patron Mark is currently beating me which is very frustrating with his 55% correct outcomes uh 9% correct scores I'm on 49% so I've gone under my 50% Target but I have I think I've got one more correct score than than Mark has uh so mine's mine's at 10% I'm having to extend this list each time just to keep me on it so I definitely need to start picking up uh hottin is winning this with his total score of 73 uh 59% correct outcome and 16% correct score incred and he's missed six matches and he's still top so congratulations to him Andy who was on earlier he's just ahead of me he's on the 50% Target 10% uh correct score so yeah well done uh well done to him but yeah if you're interested in getting involved in this head over to the blackbox patreon sign up and we can get you involved um in uh in this competition there's a trophy for the for the winner which hottin is currently winning Captain C this is uh I mean it all just points to Har doesn't it mean sck's uh touch in the Box for 90 10.6 his shots in the box is 3.1 those stats are really encouraging um for sacka but he's playing Liverpool and he's a doubt so you can't really consider him harland's next his 10 goals uh we don't need to talk about him he's going to be captured by pretty much everyone other than James from plan FPL who won't own him don't know who he's going to go for I imagine he's going to go for Palmer with Newcastle at home uh I mean he could go for slanky away at Palace given his Spurs connection but I don't think he will I think he's probably going to go for Palmer in that that that's who I go for if I didn't have Harland um foden's on this list as well if you think he's going to start and play centrally I think he's a potential option if you haven't got Harland we mentioned inmo as well home to ipswitch I think he's a good pick with his six goals this season but I think personally the question is do we captain or do we triple Captain um and yeah as I said I think I'm leaning towards the triple Captain uh this week this was my team I showed this earlier with Andy uh the triple Captain chip isn't active on this but it come is in my my main team my move is going to be seeno to garnacho uh this week benching Gabrielle um playing Ry Trent Lewis Moreno foden Ando garnacho Rogers Harland probably triple Captain Watkins and sanki so yeah I'm hoping for a decent uh Green Arrow uh this week that's pretty much all the content I've got uh for this stream more than happy to I got two beers I think it was a bit optimistic and bar even started this one it's hard to drink and talk to be fair um if you want to get any questions in for me uh I'll try and answer as many as I can I've got a couple of super chats to get through too so thank you for sending those in and yeah thanks thanks for sticking around there's 677 people watching live if you could drop a like on the video that would be amazing um if you're watching this kind of post YouTube drop us a comment as well let us know if you enjoyed it and if you're listening on the podcast give us a festar review and drop us a review on that too yeah these things yeah like I I keep saying about the community and how great it is you know being a being a I hate the phrase content creator but I don't know what else to call myself with this because I guess I do create content it just feels like a bit of a wanky term um but yeah it's a funny experience because I love it and I love talking football and I love doing blackbox with Mark and I love interacting with people and stuff but yeah there are times when it gets you down a little bit you know I've I've had quite I think I've probably had more negativity over the last couple of Seasons than I've had um in any other year that I've done it I think a lot of it does relate to to rank and obviously had a poor season last year it's getting a little bit better this this year but obviously it's not great um yeah is it's obviously not begging for compliments and stuff but it's it's nice to know that people enjoy the um the podcast and the streams and things and you know ultimately if people weren't enjoying them and they didn't they didn't like it then you kind of would wouldn't bother the reason why Mark and I stick around is because hopefully we're we're doing something that people like and and we keep enjoying as long as those two things keep happening then then uh then we carry on um yeah it's some sometimes a bit a bit demoralizing sometimes um but yeah going private I think on Twitter is is definitely helping uh right let's take a look at Andrew G thank you very much for the 499 Super Chat evening chats I'm 4.2 million yeah I've been there mate do not worry uh saaka Diaz Gabrielle and calv luin to Palma foden gimenez and at Nori for a minus 12 what I am I losing the plot a minus 12 I have taken a minus 12 twice in my life and both times it has not gone well um I mean I look at the four players you're looking at Palmer foden himz and eight Nory I like all four of those I look at the four you're taking out and think is there massive potential that they go off over the next few weeks saaka Diaz Gabrielle and calv lein I mean saca's a doubt Diaz has got tough fixtures and you know has missed out the last couple of games Gabrielle's got tough fixes K can't score I don't I don't hate it I don't hate it Andrew I mean if you've still got the wild card maybe it's time to think about using that but if you haven't I'm finding it hard to to say no to it um you know you're 4.2 million you've got foden at 6.6% ownership you've got Palmer who's a great pick himene in great form go for it I'm gonna say go for it unbelievable uh yeah I like it Andrew I'm not going to try and talk you a bit uh I know it's for a minus 12 but I think it's it's big big Improvement to the rest of your squad uh Caleb is in the chat uh Caleb is one of our patreon tier uh members uh don't ask him for his opinion on goalkeepers because he's absolutely bloody useless picking them um and he's asking me for a goalkeeper move reyya to Onana oh God just stick with reyya Caleb I mean I know you've kind of broken him and you're you're not really seeing any any Joy from him but I still maintain Arsenal are going to be one of the best defenses in in the league they've had three red cards in eight games um it's been a bit of some freaker kind of occurrences uh I I just think you know I know the fixures aren't great but if if Arsenal do keep a clean sheet in the next couple of games he's GNA have made a couple of saves and be in the bonus and I mean Manchester United defensively I'm I know theyve they've been they've been okay but I don't fully trust them I I would just leave it you you're going to keep chasing goalkeeper Halles you're going to miss out on on ones from your own team Ray is a good goalkeeper uh I would I would just stay with him uh Davies family first play one of Robinson or Davis and one of seeno or Smith row I'd definitely play Smith row against Everton uh so I think that one's quite easy um I'd probably play Robinson as well yeah I think Robinson and Smith row I if if you do I don't hate playing Robinson and seeno um but I would I would think that I mean I've got film to beat um I've got film to beat Everton so I think play your two filam assets there they're a good team this season uh Hing good to see Hing Al some one of our patreon members is it worth a minus four to SW sacka to son hope to pay for your beer as all you're very kind uh is it worth a minus four to swap sacka to S that's a tough one again if if we get a leak the cartel gets a leak sack is out yeah it probably is I mean it depends on your benches isn't it um you might have a decent player on on your Ben you know if you've got seeno on your bench I'd probably just just play him bring him in um minus fours are are tricky to get right depends what your what your plans are for some long term if if you're going to look to get rid of him for Palmer or someone in a few weeks it's probably not worth it if you think you're going to keep him right up to game week 134 um it might be the move to to make I'd be a bit reluctant to take a minus four to to swap sacka out I think sacka is gonna come back into consideration in a few weeks if he lines up against Liverpool you might be wanting him back kind of straight away I'd hold unless you're 50/50 or less that he's not going to play and then you can consider it depending on on who that bench on who that bench option is uh I won't read yours out super duper just because it's I don't want to mention the person that you're talking about uh FBO gold you mark oh it's a it's a nice soy one you Mark Credit to the F Community ignore the likes of a certain someone I'm sure you discussed foden but what's a summary I'm avoiding uh yeah I mean the summary is I've got him I'm happy with him I think he starts I think he plays centrally I can't see him playing on the left or on the right I don't think that's where where pep wants to use him um I spoke to Luke about it Luke thinks foden is at risk when pep wants to make sure he's got control of the Midfield and if he's playing against like a combative side in Midfield then he might be someone who drops out like we saw with with Wolves against Southampton he's not anticipating much of a Midfield battle and normi so he's he's pretty sure that Fen is is going to start um in that I just think you know ranks are pretty low it's game week eight we can take a punt on someone you've got sacka with tough fixtures and and potentially injured um know Salah as well um son is he the best option I don't know I just think there's there's there might not be too many opportunities to go for someone like foden because of of all the other options that we've got and against Southampton I don't think there's there's many better better punts we know what he's capable of he's an absolutely like unbelievable worldclass player on his day and he's playing the worst team in the League I genuinely think they are the worst team in the league um so yeah go for it I think it's it's pretty safe uh Matthew Perry and die for wha or just play it safe with wood just go for wood just go for wood I think that's an easy one I think given what I've learned about the fixtures tonight I'm a bit worried about the oing wood and again I wouldn't don't think I'd be saying that kind of at the start of the Season uh whist is a fine pick but he's been injured we don't know G what we're going to get we know exactly what we're going to get for wood we're going to get an attack who are basing you know their team around around getting service so I think I'm afraid it's a pretty boring answer for me in that and Dr David 1963 agrees there you go uh Sam V says Bri play wolves already this year wasn't easy 31 don't know why everyone's piling on 8 Nory this week no I think you can wait a week on him um I think people are piling on him because they're getting rid of Trent and and Gabrielle or CBA um and it's not really that obvious to nowhere to go if you looking for kind of the medium to to long term um he has got the attacking threat um I mean who else you go for we talk about how there's a bit of a lack of options at kind of four five like a mikeno or something like that you get in a Nory he's probably going to concede against Brian I'd be very surprised if we didn't score in that but I wouldn't be too surprised if he got an attacking return and then I think he is the best four fiveish option Defender so I could I can see why people are kind of going for that uh let's see if there's any more questions before I call it AB says about Edison is killing me now can't keep clean [ __ ] yep you and praz both um I think it's uh he's not someone that I've ever wanted to own but then again I thought Ray would would do the job and he hasn't either so yeah it's it's a bit of a shame uh and I'll take one more question um if the question is just from trigger hard rested for Stones this week I hope not trig considering I'm expecting to play the triple captain on him Mo says good SOL at this yeah bit of a strange one not had to do a the Black Box solo before not sure what's happening next week I think Mark said he might not even be around next week as well which I'm sure will upset quite a few people uh might see if luk or Andy's around Hopey Andy won't have another delivery it was a bit last minute with with Mark because hopefully pip isn't listening but Mark literally forgot until about 7 PM last night and was like oh my God I just realized it's Pip's birthday so I hope I hope he's treated as something nice I've met pip and yeah she uh she puts up a lot with that man bless him I love you mark right I'm going to call it there thank you all for sticking with me it's amazing to know that we've stuck around 700 people watching even though I've been just chatting um on my on my own um sorry for the technical issues at the start hopefully the graphics were okay on this stream um and yeah I'll be back next week with someone not toly sure who it's going to be but I'll definitely be back next week and good luck this game week if you are triple captaining Harland I hope he goes absolutely mad for you uh and same if you've got foden too because they will be the deci side whether I come into next pretty happy or pretty miserable anyway that's it from me thank you and see you next week [Music] [Music]",23028,21087,good evening everyone welcome to fpl blackbox ahead of gw nine take two how are you mr andy mode you right im not too bad mate is it is still lagging or are we all right no were good i think thats it i tried quite an optimistic setting the resolution to 4k and i think that might be the reason why things were as great as they were but hello to everyone im sorry that mr mark sus isnt here but its great to see you and if youre your first black boox of the season isnt it is indeed its the first black box of the season ive missed its been a while i dont know the last time i was on i know my favorite one was when we were roasting your wild car but i think that was a little while back now that was a friday night mid midseason wasnt it wasnt it the exact before christmas probably burned into my into my mind luckily my season started a little bit better this time so its not quite as as bad has it been have you found the season so far you been enjoying it its not been too bad ive ive had a little bit of a struggle so far this season usually im a little bit higher than this but its been ive made a few moves a little too early and that sometimes hurt me and i seem to have avoided the liverpool midfielder points i ive owned three of them and seem to have owned them all at the wrong times but its its picking up a little bit now got a green arrow this week so hopefully that can carry on and the teams looking all right so fingers crossed its i think this is the first time ive streamed with you for a while where youve been ahead of me which doesnt feel very nice it was heading in the direction of it was going to be my highest rank for about 18 months but red this week after so many so like so many people it was a it was a it was a strange game week and weve weve got quite a lot to talk about we only have you for about 45 minutes because then youve got a yes a delivery coming which is a supermarket of choice thats thats the key question is i love to say like id love to say like okado like that but its not no its its just tesos tesco okay i thought you were a sous man but tesco is fine so we got we got lots to cover were going to talk about all the different stats marks on some great tables for us even though hes not here we got our teams to cover and depending on how long andys around for weve got predictions and everything else if andy goes ill stay around for a bit and answer some question and things like that we do have a sponsor for this weeks episode and this is of course manscaped you are watching two bearded men on the screen right now i have the i dont know if you knew that manscape do beard trimmers do you andy as well as well as the bull shavers i didnt know that no tell me more there you go well they do they do so i use the manscape beer trimmer which is great because we go for the more longer beard look theyve just bought out a brand new product called the chairman pro which is for people who want an electric beard trimmer but want to go a bit closer to the skin so this is where the five oclock somewhere comes from you want a five oclock shadow dont theres a video of it as well where the guys doing it and its its a little bit its a little bit suspect but its called the chairman pro great new product its got two interchangeable heads that are magnetic so you can go for your stubble look or your clean shaven look pair it with your beard trim if you want to grow it a bit longer you can pair it with your ball shaver if you want to have your fresh balls as well you can use it in the shower and its its another great bit of kit from manscape so christmas is coming up if youre looking to treat yourself if youre looking for a gift ide to give someone else head to manscape cuk use our code blackbox at the checkout get 20 off and free shipping to boot and check out the range you get 20 off all the products across the across the manscape store you must be interested in that handy come on im looking at it and thinking for christmas quite a hairy family so it could be quite nice for a few stock and villers couldnt it i cant imagine you clean shaven though but it looks a bit weird do you look a child 12 i do same like if i if i went into my classroom clean shaven they wouldnt know who i was i dont think no okay maybe the chairman pro isnt you if you can pull off the baby face look unlike we can then it might be for you exactly anyway check it out manc cuk and use our code blackbox for 20 off before we get into game weeks and all of that stuff i think we have to cover the big talking point of the week and i know youve briefly spoken about it already on the scow cast but it is this whole sack content creator cartel theres already comments about the cartel in the chat that im im seeing whats your take on sacka gate there was a lot of last minute moves from sacka to son to foden from popular people within the community do you think there was anything untoward going on no we certainly didnt get any bloody news did we no i know and i said this to you before we streamed is that if youre getting news and not telling me im not going to be very happy so im pretty sure there is nothing going on behind the scenes i think it was just a lot of good managers making a good move sacka was not 100 going to play and a lot of people wanted to move him on the next week anyway and i think thats just what they did they jumped on two assets that they thought could do quite well this week and had nice fixtures moving forward which was foden and son i kept sacka myself i moved havs out i kept sacka and keeping sacka meant i got minkovich off the bench so worked okay for me i know jamm a little bit but i didnt move sacar out because i knew i had minkovich first on the bench and i think those people that had a good bench or a good person that could in there was less of a risk as those players that maybe didnt i can i can see why they made the move i want to move sacker out this week it was always my plan and if i thought he was definitely going to be out or i thought i need to move him out to get another player in i see it as a good move personally so i do also think as well people keep forgetting that these managers could have like two three four transfers in the bank at the moment so like moving a player out like that theres less risk i feel doing it when youve got lots of transfers so i dont think theres anything going on personally and if it is im not privy to it so id be very surprised you ob but theres theres nothing going on is there as my god im getting im getting called out as part of one of the people that sold him with 20 minutes of the headline and i what happened to me i got by bloody boers tweet when he was impersonating that arsenal and who sent you that list ah and in the godfathers chat bloody mark southerns shares it and hes been caught out before like that and i clicked on it and my normal check is just go over i was thinking of selling him anyway so i was looking for any excuse i click on the link he sends i check the subscriber numbers 20k i look through the previous tweets and they all look legit and thats what boa did smartly if you could call it that this time is that he created a bit of a pre loop because normally its just inject emojis and youre like okay clearly thats thats bua this time he done the ground workor and it just it completely got me so i looked at that transferred sacker out went back to the group chat and someone said thats thats boer mark and it was it was too late and thats normally the thing that catches you out and then sacka didnt play foden was benched he came off and got the assist it was a real roller coaster andy im not going to lie but ultimately it was the right decision because i had dibling for a sub but it surprised me how many people had forgotten who bua was because hasnt done anything for a little while and then all of a sudden i had people in chats going whos whos bua whos this bua why do you all know that this is fake and as soon as there was an extra letter in the charles wats thing i was like i know this is fake but the fact you did the sacka move because of it i thought i was absolutely brilliant and the fact mark sent it to you as well but you brought foden in so it didnt turn out that badly did it no and the two players that people were bringing in were son and foden and both of them got some points for the owners and i think thats what sha a bit more of a lens on it because had they both blanks i dont think people will care i just think i can i thought all week saaka would play and it was only when i saw the team arriving at the stadium and he wasnt in any of the pictures and then we had the old andy martin thing of him going to the stadium and hes all of that was just was just brilliant i was probably going to sell him this week anyway and because it was like 5050 at that point i just thought what im gonna do it a week early and bring him in and sk says getting buono in is a good cover story i love that as if id make that up to make myself look like that much of an idiot what i love someone else in the chat has put we know you two arent getting leaks because look at your ranks its like if we were getting leaks you think id be 17m at the moment ive told this story before i told it to you earlier but the only the only leak ive ever had genuinely was last season someone messaged me i spoke to a fair bit on twitter and said just heard liento playing like today and he was in my team and i had him benched and i was like do what im gonna im gonna risk it im gonna play him off the back of that benched was complete rubbish its the only leak ive ive ever had its it is a funny one what i did this poll and i just thought theres a lot of like pe theres a lot of people like trigger lips has done videos on it and als done videos on it and theres lots of people calling into question like the integrity of content creators and i just thought out of the general twitter lot so this is a sample of like 2800 people if there was this secret whatsapp group this cartel group that people think there is well some people think there is which gets team leaks youre allowed to be in it but youre not allowed to ever share them and if you ever share them youre booted out immediately how many people would join it 76 said they would join that league i love that so i know its people give it all the high mighty and i think that 24 at least half of those would still would do it i know and to be fair i said to you before the stream when you showed me these results the thing is there are some people out there that wouldnt join it because theyre already part of it so you got to take that into account as well but i if you offered somebody that opportunity of course they do it but i think as soon as youve got a certain amount of followers and i dont know how many it is specifically as soon as you got a certain amount of followers its seen as is wrong if you do get leaks and things like that but you look at the biggest guy out there which is lets talk fbl he gets the leaks and he shares them all every single one he gets his shares so i dont know what people want to be perfectly honest but i think its f i dont think there is anything going on that we dont know most of the time no i think its a shame with because andy gets a lot of the brunt of it because the biggest account and people say is he doing it for clout on his deadline streams andy doesnt build his deadline streams as being this is where youre going to get the leagues people turn up because he might get them and he has a list of people that he trust that sometimes they in those leagues before but he always shares them with people so i dont know why he why he gets some of the stick that he does in this regard dont know i think people just attack people that are theyve got a big following bas i think and its unfortunate but thats where you get the most interaction sometimes so people wouldnt be doing it if they were just shouting into the void they want to make sure people interact back with them and thats what they want half the time which thats what twitter is isnt it its not been the best place over the last week or so hopefully it starts to pick up a bit and we can start having some nice chats again but its its not being the best place anyway lets talk some fpl stuff just quickly cover my team this week it was a bit of a disaster 33 points im sure a lot of people can sympathize with that raya trent gabrielle lewis and davis all blanked in defense foden came in he got the assist from the corner in the 90th minute four points inom o to rogers came in last minute for dibling who id been saying i was going to play all week and then i just suddenly went why am i playing as southampton player lets just get rogers back in so rogers got the got the goal booked again though it always seems to get booked when he when he scores which is annoying harland with four watkins did well for me with eight and salanki has been disappointing with two and i benched moreno who got six on my bench he would have been quite a nice differential but a bit of a bit of a me game w best we just move on right lets just move on from this one we can move on to mr mark southerns team managed to have a o worse worst with he got 26 i think fleen was his i know rogers was his highest scorer but fleen was up there with four trent cba with minus three lewis with two gabrielle with one seeno rogers and bumo f and harand salanki so a pretty similar team to mine had celba with minus what did you make of the celba red card how do you think thats going to affect arsenal going forward i think it is i think on scoutcast the other day we did a little bit of an analysis on arsenal and it shows that they are already conceding more chances than they were most of last season and theyre not putting up as much xg i think the odard injury is a massive difference i think he is such a controller of the ball in their midfield and i think these have been a massive miss i do also think theyve played a lot of their games with 10 men which hasnt helped their xgc this season either and their disciplinary record is shocking compared to the rest of the season its compared to the rest of the teams i dont know whats happen like they wanted them to be tougher and theyre doing that by getting red cards all the time which isnt great for their assets and cbra celebra managers the people that went celebra and gabrielle or cra and rya and went for that double aral defense have been punished quite brutally to be perfectly honest and minus three from cba is that is brutal so i think i think it is going to i think hes only going to miss one game isnt he but i think arsenal double defense especially with their fixtures moving forward i think id be moving off one personally and when you got a player like say 8 nori or someone like that who could be good especially from next week onwards i think id probably make the move myself i it is a one match ban the commentators on the match definitely said it was a three match ban and i went back and listened to it again and they said three matches but its not violent play right so its just a one match thats how i thought it was just one game fine so hes back for newcastle and chelsea but misses the liverpool game so not ideal for mark hes already made a couple of transfers ill talk about those in a bit your team though absolutely flying 40 points coming up trumps mate it wasnt looking that good i i had i had rogers as well who didnt do too badly i was absolutely gutted salanki got nothing i was out i was out in town when it was happening i was every goal that went in i was thinking sans got to be involved and every time he wasnt involved so i was absolutely gutt about that but the big one was that those forest players on the monday night and having word who could have had a hattrick like he looked good again like he hit the post he had a few sitters that he missed and then milinkovic as well milinkovic who i got in on wild card and i was eyeing up some of these nice fixtures palace we were talking beforeand and we put cells in our strictly come captain in selections palace honestly that all they do is just pepper goalkeepers from outside the box and they cant finish to say their low so that any keeper against him it looks absolutely brilliant to play him and sals got an 11 pointer in the end so the people that were waiting on say a ss and a wood for monday night got help themselves to 18 points but they saved me massively so i was on about a 500k red arrow until monday night and then i ended up getting a green arrow of about 100k so i will take it can you remember the last time a monday night game delivered for people its been a while it has been a while it used to quite i swear the one that sticks in my mind im pretty sure hazard played against west h and got and got a brace or a hat trick wasnt it and he absolutely killed it on a monday night i remember that quite vividly but if thats the last one i remember then that says a lot thats about eight years ago wasnt it eight years normally its like youve got one or two players left on the monday night and you think right they can save my game week they can they can do something for me and then you watch the clean sheet get wiped out after like 10 minutes and then player gets subed at 65 and youre like get up my whole monday night for this but that was a good one for forest owners it went it went well are you playing linkovich this week against lisa im not hes first on my bench i think or second on my bench i cant remember now but hes not in my team currently okay ive got moreno so he is in my in my team at the moment this is the great and the good sheve been added to this after not usurping whats the word beating grayhead last year that was the punishment that he faced you coming into this im top of the three of us somehow 785k which puts me fourth which is pretty surprising just below pra one point behind prz seven points behind harry had an awful week again with 26 prz and harry both well praz harry and mark all with 26 pretty remarkable ben kellin though 54 points with his son captain thing is were looking at him as smashing it and hes only 300k like there are other people out there that are like already in the top 100k like hibo is around the 100k mark and i think its absolutely mad that hes i feel like hes played well recently ben but like i said hes only 300k i expected him to be way more than that and thats after a almost 350k green arrow so its been its been tough so far in this league i would say and i looked at my overall rank and thought god im going to be bottom half of this easily so to be top half i think it says a lot about the start of the season but we got to remember as well that its very rare that weve had triple captain be played quite as much as it has been so far thats been played a lot so maybe thats t a little bit to be taken into account because all those that played highland got 17 extra points so maybe thats skewing things a little bit but its been tough 300 kb in the top and most of us over one mil is not usual i think its been the relentless form of as well i think quite a few people didnt start with him at the beginning like myself few a lot of people sold him on wild cards in maybe gameing five or six and hes carried on doing well two double digit halles in his last couple of game weeks so if you had if you had sellah youve been youve been doing well bl says its the bad and the worse good name good name for this league i have to say seb is struggling hes hes down 48 48m not doing the scout cast riew this season and just seems to love banking those transfers thats what does it thats what does it see you leave the scout cast and it all goes to part no hes i think i saw his team value is like 995 as well like hes like you said hes kept hold of those transfers and i dont think its helped him yet but im hoping that he has a couple good weeks and he starts storming on up but hes only what just under 50 points behind me and thats three million rank so hell make that up hold i thought theres theres theres not much in it between a good rank a respectable rank and even a poor rank at this stage so dont panic dont panic too much lets take a look at some stats this is team data defense and liverpool are at the top of this they have we i think we all know that theyre the best defends given from what weve seen which is one of the major things that slots bought in in his brief tenure villa a second interestingly not a team that i trust particularly but 89 is good quite tough fixtures to come lets talk about man city though ive got lewis i every week they just seem to concede its frustrating i find with this team data defense stuff that like youve got liverpool there okay they seem like the the best defense at the moment but is it any other defense that you trust at the moment funly enough forest was one that a lot of us put a bit of put a bit of money into because that their data did look good and they got the cheap options lewis at least is cheap like were not paying for gardol like that although he turned into prime roberto carlos at the weekend but i do think forest i do think forest are good liverpools an interesting one for me still they do look good but their fixture run has been the best it could possibly be up until now so the fact that their fixtures are changing now if they start keeping clean sheets and having this good a daya against teams like arsenal villa city like then we can start taking them seriously but i theres not a lot i was thinking about this with goalkeepers theres not a lot of goalkeepers i fancy moving forward either but theres an awful lot of fixtures that are changing soon so if youve got those high upside defenders like anate nori like that ive already mentioned them anyway their fixtures change you dramatically moving forward brentfords are looking good moving forward brightons look good after a while like all of a sudden youre looking at a few different teams and its just based on fixtures but i think forest and liverpool look the two best defenses ive seen so far villas interesting though because i thought villa might struggle with their whole playing in europe this year but theyve killed it in europe and they seem to not be having too much of a hangover after the games either so fair play to them its arsenals the biggest one for me it has been a bit of a drop off but do you think a lot of that is because of the red cards or do you think something quite dramatic has changed this year well i think i think its it doesnt help does it when youve had three red cards in eight games its its going to skew the statistics a bit against leicester it was just two freak worldly goals from james justin not much you can do about that i wonder if and james made this point last week that maybe they do switch off a little bit against some of the teams they expect to beat because theyve got so much of the ball because theyre so in control if youre two it up maybe do just take your eye off the prize a little bit and i think we saw that in the first game against wolves should have scored in that match villa was a tough game next but again i think watkins miss an absolute sitter in that game so i dont think its its surprising that maybe they havent hit the heights that we thought given that start but at the same time no clean against leicester southampton and bournemouth i know is a concern especially when you go into the run that theyre going on to now with liverpool newcastle and then chelsea are you are you doubled up you doubled up on arsenal defense im not so i was going to and then we werent sure whether ry was going to play so i brought flein in and went with havitz got me two goals in two weeks i was quite happy with that and now ive moved on from hav to salanki so no i wasnt and i think those people that went for double arsenal defense it was the floor play it was the im expecting some clean sheets in this run which was a good decision but its like i said its been its been paid off in the in the worst way especially with the celba red card rounding it off for a lot of managers there so i do think weve got to look at the data were seeing at the moment and think that arsenal arent the elite defense we thought they were but liverpools the one thats most interesting to me in terms of maybe not a trent because hes expensive we got to try and get those premium mids but when youve got players like canate who look good and kellerer who could potentially be in goal until december with reports that are coming out like theyre not the worst players to potentially to invest in but i do want to see how they get on against an arsenal and a villa and a city in the next five im i am doubled up on arsenal ive got gabrielle bench this week because i cant bench re havent got a backup benching gabrielle is a is a risky move given the given his threat from set pieces but i do want if we are going to see people pivoting to a double liverpool defense because i know theres theres jotter theres diaz theres salah theres trent theres theres there are decent picks there but if youre not going for salah i can see why people arent going for one of josh oraz given the fact that they get benched and theres rotation around that js now got this little injury so i wonder if maybe its its trent canate and then you leave the third spot open for salah i wonder if were going to see people doing that when the pictures turn id be very surprised id be surprised if people went double liverpool id be surprised if people are even got one at the moment unless its trent and even then the majority of people i know that have trent are thinking of selling him because hes just that cash cow that you need to move to those premium mids so id be very surprised the fixtures i wouldnt say are there the brighton games not too bad but brighton can attack so im looking at those fixtures and thinking i dont think now is the time to be moving to it from 15 onwards theres theres a case for it but i would be very surprised i think people are going to be moving off defense quite quickly and theyre going to be pumping their money into midfield because thats where it all is and were going to get to a time from 12 onwards when were wanting sacka were wanting son were wanting fod palmer were wanting all that harland still potentially and i think i just dont see it personally i think were going back into the old days of make your defense as cheap as possible and pump everything into midfield and strikers which it did wouldnt it thats exactly what it used to be 45m defenders across the board so well see do have trent well thats what do you think trents going to be the sacrifice for this i think so i think its just too easy a sacrifice to make in terms of you free up like three million by moving down from him and i and i think thats the biggest thing that people are going to do and when youve got players like i said like eight nori or i dont know mikeno that you can down to and they got nice fixtures i think people will do it other end of the table the obvious ones i switch a bottom i think no surprises there southampton and then leicester all in and around two expected goals conceded every game clearly the teams to target chelsea down in 17th i knew their defense had been bad but it has been bad according to the stats its interesting that one the three at the bottom of the three youd expect and theyve got some weve got some players with nice fixtures against them this week in brenford and weve got man city as well chelse is an interesting one and i think a lot of people didnt go for sanchez because they thought he was going to lose his place but i dont hate the idea of sanchez because they do concede a little bit of xgc if that makes sense but i would love to see how much his whats that stat was it xg prevented isnt it xgc prevented for keepers id love to see where he is on that because he always looks hes got a cler in him but andy let me let me let me get that up for you right now there you go at this there you go it is xgp is there its its ones four so its not great well hes hes four for points per 90 one is one ranks about one of one of the lowest on show i think ray rayer and leno the two lowest and pford pi at 23 leno at 24 no its an interesting that the two liverpool boys being top if we find out allison is out for a little bit longer kellaher is going to be extremely popular but onan is always going to be up there because we can see so many chances as well but no i was interested to see where sanchez was on this but i dont think that its its tough with chelsea because the fixtures arent there for quite a while are they youd be looking to move in maybe 12 or 13 and again if youve got a keeper thats is doing fine youre not going to be moving for one are you no just to just to reiterate what this what this chart showing so expected goal prevented just indicates how i think i think its the best metric of how well a goalkeepers been performing this season you can see hanson is there at the top at 46 hes prevented nearly five goals with some of the saves that hes made pope there at 31 anana had a great start to the season 33 you wouldnt expect to see rea in the minus so hes hes let in more goals than he should have done give what we seen from the champions league when hes saving penalties and rebounds and all that thing its you wouldnt expect to see it reversed allison at 27 so theres been some keepers that have had strong starts the season very interesting though that fens bottom one well not bottom but hes bottom of this list and minus 170 but hes got more save points than anybody else this season hasnt he yep hes made 42 saves and next best is pope with no next best is hanson with 40 and then its pope with 35 so thats quite interesting but fens also got the fixtures coming up i switch bournemouth leicester at home and hes got two nice away fixtures youd be hoping for something in that run i would have thought yep lets look at some attacking data dont know if you like me i think i probably trust the attacking data more than i trust the defensive data especially when you see teams like city and villa at the top when what i see is teams that can play quite well against them apart from in the champions league theyre doing well spurs are a topic that were going to talk about bit more this episode ive got a table on some of their assets and they are top non 90 expect to score two goals a game with chelsea second 186 and man city just off that 185 but spurs players weve both got slanky how are you feeling about how are you feeling about that hes going to be in and around the attack the thing that is interesting at the moment and i was listening to the above average pod and they were saying the same thing is that he seems to be doing that firmino role like firmino used to do for liverpool where he does a lot of the work to make sure that the wingers get what they need to do and madison kisi brennan johnson son seem to be thriving because theyve got that striker up front and you think theyve had te o vera richison and people like that for a little while since kanes left and i think is what theyve needed theyve needed that player thats a bit selfless and will do that not great for fpl nobody ever picked forino he did have those weeks where he did well i think sank will still be fine but i think if youve got sank and hes your only attacking spurs asset i think you probably want to try and get another one especially for this little run that theyve got as well and the fact they in 11 and 13 theyve got two captain all fixtures my biggest thing is which one do you go for because i think if you were set me up so perfectly i know i know because look at this because son is the one that seems to be the explosive player that weve weve had an fpl before and hes the one that can hit those heights and get you the braces hat tricks whatever its going to be brennan johnson seems to be getting a ridiculous amount of chances inside the box and touches inside the box which it shows here but ive got such a soft spot for koseski like i think hes creating so well at the moment but is he captain a ball i dont think he is so all roads lead to son madison the big thing this week was that he got taken off at halftime he was playing well but they needed to change things and he was the one that went so i think all roads lead to on personally unless you need a cheaper option then i think you probably just go brennan because the value is there interesting i see i think all roads lead to brennan with this touch touches in the box 64 for brenan johnson interesting keski isnt isnt far off that with 62 so having like 10 touches in the box a match essentially i havent fact checked this mark southern sent me he did also send me boers tweet to take it with a pinch of soul but he told me brenans touches in the box is identical to harlands in terms of her so you think about parlans position his average position and where he just stands or johnson is getting that many touches in the box from out from out wide i know i brennan looks nailed now doesnt he i think hes going to be playing every game for them moving forward kisi i think is as well son weve been told by andre already that hes going to be managed this season he cant be playing every single game 90 minutes hes got to be managed a bit more so you would think that raras and verer are going to be coming on for son and maybe verer coming on for salanki so that koseski role i think i think between koseski and brennan i think theyre fine and theyre an awful lot cheaper as well i do have a soft spot for koski but i just think son is there and hes the one youd want to captain in 11 and 13 would you captain brennan johnson in 11 and 11 in 11 or 13 against ipswitch will f him no i wouldnt but im not looking at im not looking at alternative captains other than other than harland at the moment i think if i think if holland wasnt in the picture it would it might be it might be a bit different whos holland got in third who city got in 13 is that the brighton game city of liverpool away okay so you so you probably do need an extra captain lets get the lets get the ticker up hang on so in 13 city have liverpool youve got that great spurs game against fulham im looking at chelsea with villa at home thats not too bad either arsenal with west ham away i dont know would i rather have son than saaka or palmer thats the thing that i keep coming back to i just dont think i would sacka is the one because i think sacka by the time you get to 12 if hes fit again which will most likely happen youre looking at sacka in 12 back because youre going to want to be getting on some of those arsenal assets again potentially but palmer if you dont own palmer now when do you think is the entry point when do you think i need to get him back in for that game you is the leer one in 12 you have you have to get him in 12 dont you so if youre getting lester if youre getting him in 12 and you need son for 13 because he looks the best captaincy option or a or spurs when how are you going to own all these players by well i dont i dont think son i dont think son is needed that ive said this from the start of the season its its probably going to come back and bite me when sons ends up to the top scorer in fpl like that but if im looking at son compared to saaka palmer salah harland hes the fifth one for me out of those hes the one im im picking last and the fulham game isnt its not like southampton at home or rip switch at home hes got him in 11 harland has brighton where he will get chances against us believe me so do i need to get do i need to get some full at home when palmers got villa at home i dont mind that for palmer and then palmers got him switching south antony for side i think palmers got to be a mustone from 12 isnt he i the more you look at it as well hes in 12 hes got leicester in 14 hes got southampton the big thing for me with palmer now is like and i mentioned this on scoutcast about five weeks ago is that hes one of the only players that can go big anymore like i dont when you look at other players and you think harland can salah still has it in him but hes slowed down a little bit compared to what he used to be sacka doesnt massively go big i know he has what twice but you wouldnt expect it in a game week whereas palmer against the right oppos position just goes mental and hes not playing in europe i just think when youre looking at those fixtures its not like you have to look and say but hes he might play midweek hes not going to so i feel like palmer from 12 is a musthave so its just when the rest of them come in but like you just said if you swerve son and you go for a koseski or a brennan johnson it means you can get on a sacker and a palmer quite easily in 12 the alternative is youve got youve got j johnson compared to to son there about 3m saving there you could go jackson over palmer theres going to be what a 4m saving there no lets stop you could do or you go havs over sacka right and thats thats your 15m saving i was going to ask you which of those you think is a decent a decent tradeoff im guessing its not its not jackson its not its not either i dont think i dont think i want either over them as gone hello is it just me whats happened has as disappeared i have no idea whether its just me hello im assuming this is just me im waiting for him to come back in rip as just you andy cartel got him he mentioned too much hes back again do what this is one good thing though about streamyard is awful is what ive learned from this whole experience has been not because of you because were having to wait we have to pause between each bloody thing so we can we can speak they were just talking to me it was lovely but at least one of us can like leave and come back in it doesnt kill the whole stream true i was i was just saying if we are looking to save some money like where can you go foden to harlands the other one isnt it do you ever think foden is going to be a replacement for him no not at the moment no and we talked to luke quite a bit and hes saying like there i we dont see a time at the moment where fodens going to be nailed on because that hes not going to play him on the wings and that midfield three with gundan is where he wants to go and he seems scared of teams playing in counterattack so it doesnt look like theres going to be a fixture where you can say fodens definitely going to play even this week and i dont think fodens a good buy this week because a lot of people with foden are probably going to be moving off him in a couple of weeks so its tough and its a shame because you want them but i dont feel like theres over a longer period of time i dont feel like you can compromise on sacka palmer and harland i just dont think you can whereas son could be one you compromise on but the others i just dont think they are of course theyre all on penalties as well which is such a major factor too ive got ive got foden probably until gw 12 and then and then im probably going to be losing him for palmer in some way losing foden before spurs at home though doesnt feel amazingly amazingly good if he play but thats the thing you think thats going to be a case all season do you think fodens going to be a doubt all season or you reckon hes eventually going to be straight hes going to be number one its a shame i think he is i thought kdb being out i thought that nailed him on but i think with rodri being out and gundan coming in and the fact that hes quite scared of that midfield not being secure enough against teams he seems to keep picking gundan who i dont think has been great since hes come back either and i think it just means that foden ends up being the player that doesnt play and what savio is great at the last night and so is matas nunes as well and i just think fodens being turned into little bit of a scapegoat and not getting the minutes were expecting and coupled with the fact that hes had a bit of an injury too its meant that unfortunately one of those explosive players from last year were now having second outs about and its not like we havent got other options like i said you got saaka palas son and thats just naming three of them and then youve also got players like inmo so all of a sudden it just becomes foden is a bit more dispensable this season than he was last season its got mahrez vibes hasnt it like when we all thought mahrez was going to be first name on the team sheet when hed been playing well week after week after week he gets he gets benched mar has never won play of the season like foden did last year and it does seem surprising that hes potentially going that way but he has had history with pet before la last season was the blip for foden because he played pretty much every game before they i know i know and to be honest i thought that was it then but i think things have changed i think the rodri injury did shock it did shake them quite a lot as well to lose him for the whole season i think is massive for them and i just think ive always said with foden last year he was playing every game so it was absolutely fine and when harland didnt play or de bron didnt play he was he was another focal point which is awesome as well but i just think this year hes turned into a player that were having doubts about every week and you dont want to invest in too many players youre having doubts about every week and like i said theres alternative so ill be getting rid of him for palmer most likely not this week itd be 12 were all saying that because marks in the chat with ar and hes saying he doesnt feel confident about phone and regrets buying him and wants to move elsewhere all three of us have got him and were all feeling same way but and remember as well weve got fent and lewis so its its every week youre looking thinking if both of those are benched like thats a massive hit to your team and the upside hasnt been there yet so thats the other issue like hopefully when he does play and if he plays this week we could be absolutely loving life and he scored in champ league as well so well see what happens but hes not as certain as he was last year thats for sure weve got a little bit sidetracked just to come back to the spurs assets table i saw a question asking us to rank these in order just to just for the podcast listeners son comes out top on terms of points per 90 71 and hes mentioned kazis assist potential hes the highest on show out of som brell and kvi madison and sanki 34 pretty much brennans the one whos getting those shots away getting the shots in the box hes having those touches all in the area as well slanky is having the best chances if you look at xg per shot non penalty 026 thats the highest so when he is getting an opportunity its the highest xg shot and he has had the most big chances as well with eight compared to brenan six so he so sinki is still there im not like you say when i watch him im not that impressed but the stats dont make me think hes an awful option i just think brennan is probably the one i if you could offer me those if you offer me the swap for free i think id probably take you up on it i its interesed that though like salanki i think is fine because hes that striker position and when youre looking at strikers i think harland salanki wood seems to be the ideal three at the moment in terms of fixtures looking forward and form and things like that but that midfield slot i think is quite tough son its im fighting in the back of my head with keep it simple and simple as son because i can afford son and thats just keeping it simple hes the goal scorer but i do think brennan and koseski at that discount you it cant be ignored and i do get what youre saying with brennan johnson ive just got this thing in my head that brennan johnson is g to revert to type soon but as kfy i ive owned koseski before and hes done well but again hes got his issues where hes not a goal scorer so i think ill probably end up with son but kulu is the one in the back of my head but are you going to bren this week or are you is this just the one youd pick if you could no im not my transfer well i be interested to get your take on my transfer because im im doing these match of the day notes on twitter and the reason for that is i want to give myself a reason to watch match today because i didnt watch it religiously last year and i had my worst ever season and i think i was watching a lot of live football but i think sometimes its nice to get a bit more of a broader overview of whats of whats going on and i think match to day is helpful because they break down the tactics and you see players that you might not otherwise have seen or mentioned and i have to say the player that ive been impressed with for a little while and particularly i thought against brenford was your was your mate garnacho your boy i thought he was unb i think he had eight shots in that game against brenford i just think hes taken it a bit personally being benched in those first few matches and theres always question marks around man utd and whether tar can get them playing any brand of football that doesnt rely on individual brilliance but he is a hell of a player isnt he gacho and the fixtures again were going to come back to the fixtures graphic but the next five for man utd west ham chelsea leicester ip switch everton four of those five games against four of the weakest teams in the league well five if you include chelseas defensive you see exact so i theres been so many false dorms with united and it happens every season every season we got hang on theyve started looking good again i will say that front three of rashford gacho and holand did look good and i think holand is the one that weve missed because xerx is not that type of player i do think that looked good bruno that assist was absolutely beautiful by the way and if anybody else did that wed be talking about it for ages but i do think na would be the one to own especially if he continues to play on the left and i think for the fixtures weve got coming up especially after this week i think west hams fine but the fact that weve then got leicester at home everton at home and we got i switch away i think they are investable in but its who are you buying him instead of and if youre buying him instead of a spurs asset i dont think id do that i think id want a piece of that spurs pie and then i think you could probably wait until 11 because i dont think youd invest ahead of chelsea even though their xgc is so low i dont think you would so i think youd probably be waiting till 11 but from 11 onwards i think a gun at is not that bad we could even see a rashford resurgence which he was about 80 owned at one point after co wasnt he so ive just im used to this with united theres been so many false dawns and you think youre getting in there early and you just end up going at the wrong time so but garache would be the one i think ive already got salanki i could double up on it as a sp thats what marks doing hes got slanky hes already moved for johnson hes going one step further and buying a player we havent even mentioned from spurs which is porro as well bringing in por bringing in por this week so hes going hard on spurs i think im gonna im gonna pivot away from it and have a bit of a punt on gacho i had him last season i feel like he owes me i benched him for two braces last season yes i remember that which he was cheap as chips last year wasnt he was hes five million was i think i got at 49 something like that and again its stupid but playing a 49 asset feels rough playing a 62 asset feels a bit better even though its the same player its just how a feel works this is a new graph that graph chart that marks put together this is so the this is game we nine xgi of course game week eight xgi so this is xgi just for the game week and i think again this goes quite nicely with like talking about match of the day and highlights and what you see from individual game weeks we look at the stats we look at like a longterm view and last six game weeks is typically what we look at also can we to see who were the the top performers in individual game week i mentioned gachos shots hes not in the top 30 that i could see for xgi non penalty so they werent exactly great chances but he was having a lot of them brenan not though i wanted to talk about playing for leicester hes at the top of this 15 i was impressed with him this week havent been since he signed for leicester hes looked all right for briyan when ive seen him play hes come with a big reputation i think tz said he was going to be the next liel messi which is little bit of hype to live up to hasnt delivered i dont think brighton ever knew what his best position was tried to put him on the right hasnt got the pace for that we had a lot of players who could play in the 10 but delivering at leicester what your thoughts on him i dont hate him at all i think hes hes playing all right i think leicester fixtures what they got forest not great potentially but then ipswitch and then from 13 onwards it looks a little bit rosier so i dont hate him as a pick i i play so rare ive got him in that and hes absolutely killed it in that in the last couple of weeks so im very happy there its just i think weve got other players that are cheap options to say like are you going to go with a bonon not or are you going to go with a rogers i think is the comparison because youre not going to want more than won midfielder at 5m and rogers has been the absolute bargain so far this season and i think stop it stop it im not too im not totally sure about that i think that i think can well if you we look at some of the players on this list midfield is around five million so youve got buon not okay hes probably not too many people going there but i think hes a hes a decent option seeno is on here at 56 two rough games fixtures on exactly two rough games but you get through those and then its its a decent run do you think smith row is now just not a consideration for us at f im i mentioned that so on scoutcast two weeks ago hibbo and nacho were saying smith row is still a good and i was thinking i dont know whether he is anymore i would much rather have a rogers over him id much rather have a bonon not potentially although like i said the fixtures maybe arent there enough for me but i still think rogers is the one if i was wild card and rogers would be on it 100 and then youve got patrick flor saying no mcneel i think mcneils an option at 56 with the fixures theyve got i love mcneil ab rutter at brighton is welbeck still out well herzel has said that he it sounded painful he said hed like knocked a nerve in his back like that and he was still in quite a lot of pain id be very surprised if he if he started against walls ferguson played 60 minutes im not sure hes got a bit of a knock as well but it could be rter up front if ferguson and welbeck are both out we might see rter up top not sure wholl then play at the 10 maybe gruda comes in at 10 or they push like a bber up to that role but i think rutters looking like we paid 40 billion for him it raised a lot of eyebrows hes looking like a good player for us do the one player im going to mention and this is my like my differential i think hes like 3 owned is is dams guard for brenford hes on set piece is hes looked good hes got three assists in his last two games i think hes someone especially with their fixtures coming up as well what they got ip switch bournemouth lester all at home you could youre gonna be wanting to play him potentially i think if you could have a double up with him and aumo and then have those three premiums i quite like that so damars my little one hes not on this is he but hes hes one that im gonna tip moving forward okay well in the sleeper draft the wire have got dams guard and i know i know zal was talking up on the video they did today so i think they probably agree with you on that two more players i wanted to mention on this list one of them you own already chris wood 091 seven points for him gimenez ral gimenez 57m next 074 if we jump ahead and we come to the forwards table both are where are they on this list so where wood is 17th i saw them earlier wood is 17th and jimenez i dont think is jimenez is eighth on this say 63 for him and wood at 39 woods expected gold per 90 is pretty low isnt it at 39 thats the first thing i saw 78 accuracy and 31 conversion surely thats not sustainable surely i think he looked good he could have got more on monday night i genuinely i think he is he is such a good option if i was wild card in this week i am almost certain i would have chris wood in my team if i was wild card in after this week i might move to somebody else maybe like a ca or al larson because i think they might start coming into teams with wolvess fixtures changing and i think theres going to be a bit of an uptick there but i think woods fine i feel i feel like if youve got wood now he if youve got wood now youre going to keep him and youre going to be more than happy with the fact that youve got him but if you dont he is going to be the player that you do not move to every week and hes just going to keep it theres always a striker like this always a striker i swear every season that does this and hes just going to be that one where people are like no he wont carry it on and hell just keep plooding away i reckon its funny is it because at start of the season everyones saying not only is he is he not gna is he not going to do that well but hes not going to play because alanai is going to come back and take his place that that has just been put completely to b nuno likes him i think he likes what he brings the side and hes almost built its a prettyy exciting attack with hudson ado gibs white and elanga but its all about anderson was unreal absolutely unreal so its like a like a man city light instead of harland up top theyve got chriswood christ is this just you trying to bring mark back next week saying all the lovely things about him i wood has been mark has got it wrong about wood he was pretty anti him in the start of the season and i think he always thought that tyra would have eventually come back and take him but hasnt done so i were on borrow time with you now were were six minutes past eight youve got a tesco delivery arriving any minute itll be coming any minute mate bit of i know its like this its all the track can talk about but itll be here in a minute i would have thought well before lets theres still some stuff i can cover i can i can carry on when youre gone but lets jump ahead quickly just to your team for the week in case you do have to jump out im sure people will be desperate to know what your what your plans are al they can watch them on the scout cast i doubt theyve changed too much but this is your team read out for the podcast thiss and tell us what youre what youre thinking so i got flecken in goal ip switch at home gabrielle pedro porro rico lewis foden and bumo rogers sacka who is yellow flagged at the moment and then salanki harland and wood up top with harland as my captain minkovich first on my bench seeno and greaves dont know where that injury came from but greaves is out for about four weeks unfortunately and valdar ss my on the bench i am pretty happy with this team this week i think this team looks fine this week ive already got that triple up with city ive got double up with brenford which is in buan fleen its a pretty good fixture there my main move im looking at this week is sacka out and it will be for a spurs mid its just which mid i go for i think ill just end up going son but i am very tempted to save the money and then move from foden up to palmer got money in the bank so ive got 17 in the bank so i can move sacka to anybody i could even go to palmer now if i wanted to but i think i will go for a spurs mid its just which one i go for but your voice then i know i dont know what happened sps mid but the one thing i will say is i dont want to move down from sacka and then spread the funds i want to keep those price points because i want those two premiums in midfield so i dont want to mess it around too much but sacka will most probably be going out i have no idea whether hes going to play this week and even if he does i dont expect a lot from arsenal in that fixture i think that is as tough a fixture as its going to get for them so im pretty sure thats what im going to do its between son and koseski i think sorry because you and mark are both going to be trebled on spurs and that just isnt something that i would consider i dont fully trust them i know their attacks been good but they went down against west ham theyve they threw away a two goal lead against us they were awful in the second half against leicester in the first game they seem to have good spells and theyre not so good spells theyre not theyre not a very reliable team for a triple up on potentially but then they were top of the xgc they were top of xg on your table and i look at it and just think with those two fixtures coming up in 11 and 13 to have that triple spurs and potentially the captain one of them as well those are the games where you can get massive games and i just think why not go for a triple up captain one of them and if it hits youre flying and i think thats the thing i quite like at the moment ive done it with city i went early on foden which im quite happy i did because otherwise id be second guessing whether to go for him now so the fact ive got triple city this week this is the week where im hoping to hit big with them as well so i think you can do that every now and again and this is what ive wanted to do so im pretty sure im going to do it okay no man united players for a good run you faith yes maybe a gun out show but i its tough moving him in with all those other players i want ill show you my team the order of this stream has gone completely out of the window technical issues stream out the window youre off to do a s a tesco delivery its all its all carnage this is my team its raying goal with trent lewis and moreno im playing him tomorrow against lester away foden and bumo seeno rogers harland watkins and sanki up top ward gabrielle davis and dibling on the bench i could do smeno to johnson ive got the money to do it but i think im going to take the punt on garnacho as i said i like it just something a bit different i think hes like eight owned something like that i remind you this in two weeks i know i know and all the people on these all these people the on the video as hat united hes never going to bring in united player and all that its like well thatll shut you up when i have one in my team would it im play every are you going to are you going to wait till the last minute and get the lead before you get gacha in or are you ill see what comes through in the cartel whatsapp group and make the decision on that i will be hoping for a leak on moreno because theres always a chance he could miss out for im assuming my request to join the cartel is still pending on the pending youre not youre not a patreon member yet so thats true give us your give us your eight quid a month whatever it is and then you can cool i see what i can do big question though andy the big question that we havent even covered yet and it doesnt show it on this graphic but it is currently active on my actual fpl team triple captain any consideration for it no none at all no i just dont think i would ever play it in a single game week just dont think i would i the fixture is there and the people that did it against dip switch and you got the hattick 17 points times three lovely but double game week you you only have to get a goal in each game and max bonus and youre beating that so i will not be doing it this week and i would be absolutely shocked if i did it in a single game week in any season i dont even know what the double game weeks are going to be but it could be that i dont go with harl it could be i put it on salah could be i put it on someone else palmer potentially so no i 100 wont be doing it but little birdie tells me you might be im about im 6040 in favor of playing it im im im a bit annoyed with myself i didnt play on him against ip switch because mark and i did the match of day challenge mark didnt own harland it would have been fun to have gone into that challenge with him with all triple captain i did have it on him very briefly and then i took it off and i thought its a bit too early for that like game week was it game week three was it game week two was game week two wasnt it against z switch i just thought that was a little bit early my reasoning for thinking about it now is that ive seen southampton play and i cant remember too many teams who play as badly in defense as theyve done its its the perfect blend of a manager who isnt changing his philosophy and in some ways fair enough thats how they got promoted he doesnt want to change but do you need to adapt a little bit to the premier league well it doesnt look like martins done that at all is individual mistakes from the defenders and its just an overall real lack of quality in that southampton team like ramale was a good signing for them hes not a bottom three goalkeeper but that defense that midfield the fact theyve not got any like out ball to a to a stri and i know theyve got archer but you almost want them to have a big man up top that they could at least a leave bit pressure and win the ball high up and hold it up they dont seem to have that i just dont know how it can happen that city dont score multiple goals against them at the weekend whats your expectation on minutes by the way my my the doors just gone so ive gotta go thats it youre gna go pleasure as always thank you guys i had a i had a message lined up for that and he needs to go put his petty fu away this is the first time ive ever done a proper episode of ffi black box on my own and i did the team selections last season but havent done them on my own so i thought i could just carry on for a little bit ive got a couple more charts go through the predictions can answer some questions and things that people might have its just me if you dont like listening to me then probably best you drop off because im g to watch the numbers go down crazily but if you if you want to stick around and we can we could do another half an hour or so then lets go for it i do need another beer though should i grab that now should grab that in a bit not too sure anyway lets carry on for a little bit more lets talk about some of the other tables that weve that weve got so lets go through the main one so this is defenders over the season you saw on my team earlier that i had leaf davis at the in the starting 11 hes third for exped gold 90 at 24 the question marks are around whos going to score the chances that hes he creating hes a creator of chances shots per 90 when you compare that to trent is half you to porro two its a lot a lot lower than that but the chan he creating is high 25 is the highest its now higher than trent i think he was second going into the league trent had a had a difficult game but davis is creating chances a reasonable rate theres just no one that can has grab the bill we right well do okay i do defender tables then ill go grab a beer so i do like davis i just dont know and mark said this on the video he did early in the week the lets walk fbl is it enough to be creating chances when theres not anyone who can who can put them away and i think weve spoken about fors weve spoken about himz and kuna and stran larson i think dap was big flavor of the month going into the everton game and now its its massively gone down to some of the others so well see how we switch bounce back from pretty bad losses to lose that heavily to west ham and then to lose to everton in that manner i think mckenna is going to be worried you they come out of a bad run they want to start getting points on the board and then its a bit of an issue so hes hes still in my team but i dont think im gon to be playing him for the for theable i mentioned porro marks bringing him in this week nine goals conceded is the problem he hasnt had the attacking returns he got that goalen game week one not anything else yet i thought l impressive in the west ham game getting full a lot i do wonder if brennan cutting in means porro goes out a bit wider means that hes not getting as close to goal as he maybe was last season hes still getting chance hes still getting opportun he had that shot near the end which was absolutely awful but it was from the right the right area so i think hes hes a decent option this week i play i played davis over moreno and i do wonder if it is like a clean sheet first policy that we need to adapt with defenders i think particularly this season when the bonus doesnt favor attacking defenders the bonus does favor the clean sheets you clean sheet for a defender we i think it was murillo sals did aa get a bonus in that in that forest game maybe not but its the its taking multiple attacking returns almost for defenders to get something from it so a bit of a bit of a concern im not im not totally sold on po i think five5 is a bit too much for him but if youve got him i hold him i dont think id be ill be buying him is there any else on this list that inspires im not totally sure there is i think minkovich is a good shout if youve got him hes 20th on this list he has an assist i think he got that the week before last i think hes hes probably the stand out in that in that bracket i dont mind anor either but those fullbacks dont seem to be getting forward a lot too much so i think milinkovic would be the one if youre looking to tap into to forest nor 13 two goals two assists not point2 exra p maybe expecting that to be a little bit higher given the attacking returns that hes got maybe suggest that hes been a little bit lucky but i think hes gonna be pretty popular brighton are gonna thrash him this week so dont buy him yet but going forward the fixures are pretty decent for them couple more that we flagged here we got manning at southampton climbing up the thing look at his chan to created for 90 in the top 10 thats why were featuring him vanderberg in 4 not sure what happens with rico henry when hes back but 4m i think vanderberg is probably the one to go for and you got moleno popular seven points and from himly keane got the got the big hole but mikeno didnt do b mikeno didnt do badly 89th on the list though it doesnt look like youre going to get much from these everton defenders so youve got to hope for those one nil wins that we know d is capable of but again if you got him at 4 five hes probably a bit of a keep so theres some decent option defense theres no one that i dont think anyones a mustone trent and gabrielle obious got the tough fixtures lewis is a hold but isnt getting the clean sheets i think his minutes are pretty safe i think walkers being phased out a little bit maybe its a bit of a shame that stones has made a bit of resurgence because he can play in that inverted role but im hoping that lewis carries on vels 18th going to pay a little bit more for him two goals in the last couple of games hes a good pick as well but no one i think we said this a lot last season about defenders not having too many standouts i think were getting that again this year so when ive got trent who have i got ive got trent gabrielle theyre okay ive got lewis im reasonably happy with ive got moreno that could be any not kn forest defender im pretty happy with those going forward so not looking to make any defensive moves in the in the near future right im going to grab a beer im going to stick the stting soon back on no technical issues im hoping at this stage its a bit annoying with andy were a little bit delayed so thanks for sticking around a couple of people have left with it just me but still 770 people watching again were caring for about another half an hour or so im going to grab a beer and i will see you all in about five minutes i am back and what is better than one beer sure the answer its two beers there we go thanks for sticking around everyone still 700 people watching this which is amazing if you i know its a thursday night but if you fancy grabbing a alcoholic or a nonalcoholic drink and joining me as we just rattle through the rest of these tables thatd be great andy is getting his tesco delivery and then he has got his community thing where he does that educational id like to think its like a seminar that he does so if youre if youve enjoyed listening to andy tonight hes always great to have on standby for these things then check out his community and get involved in that right lets have a look at the mids to cheeky hazy james absolutely i dont like brog as a company theres all the problems the owner has had in the past and im im not a big fan of how they how they operate but unfortunately they do make a pretty decent beer and im a bit of a sellout so thats where thats where were at right lets look at midfielders jaks shaking in the background he all right its fine midfielders then so i mentioned garnacho he doesnt feature well on the list for the last the last we show which was on the xg for the game week hes showing up highly though on here hes 13th on the list 57 x non penalty for 90 i always say around 06 is your like elite elite numbers if you if youve got a player whos consistently getting around 06x non for 90 i said that puts him in a pretty good position when you consider the fact hes 62m as well i think thats nice inter that is identical to seeno who i would be selling for him the amount of shots seeno has is crazy he does have some from outside the air i think hes had the most shots of all midfielders which isnt shown on this on this table but in terms of those shots in the box for 90 297 ranks him to just below salah 298 look at br though 388 thats the highest of all of all midfielders but garnacho 269 decent touches in the box per 90 737 for him thats higher than s think just making some hacking nois in the background thats nice ive disturbed he was fast asleeping so went and got these got these beers so it maybe feels a little bit sideways doing that doing that seeno toono move its villa away next for simo then its man city i think he could get some joy in those i dont think selling is a if you were going to keep him i wouldnt say its a terrible move lets put it that way im just trying to tap into those slightly better fixures for and hes a player that i just genuinely like and im not seeing him many teams so theres a few reasons there to get rid of him savio is fifth on this list i think hes an interesting one as well if you are looking to go for someone a bit different in the man city attack i thought he played brilliantly in the champions league last night hes looked good in the games that ive ive seen him play he was amazing for jona last year thats why city of the ball i dont think weve seen that player from him in terms of that output if you look at some of these numbers look at those touches in the box per 90 992 thats in the top five for midfielders the ex 9 is high as i mentioned 71 and i wonder when his that right hand spot of the city team does feel up for grabs and hes clearly got hell of a lot of talent so i think its going to be sooner rather than later we see him see him break in the trouble is do you weigh or do you take a punt on it for this southampton game i think again hes someone thats thats flying under the radar he might even be some i was considering but im im already tripled up with lewis foden and harland someone to consider malison sats a great on in 85 ex on 90 but andy mentioned his early sub i think thats a bit of a concern when the players going off halftime poo klu said they werent controlling the game which is rare for him to say that i think hes said in the past that he doesnt care about how much they control it as long as they score goals and get the win but they need to do something to get a handle on that west ham game and it was definitely that sub that changed things around and kf impact that he had i think after that sub was made so i think hes now a bit too risky and weve already talked about the spurs players i still think johnson is the one to go for but i dont blame people for going for son because we know what his pedigree is like its just that its just that sanky role we give him a couple of weeks s does but if hes blanked again in the next couple hes going to be someone that we that we look to take out i dont think its fair to talk about midfielders though without talking about morgan rogers at 5m at the start of the season hes not showing up on these stats you have to go down to 4 first to find him 38 hes not in the top 10 for touching the box hes not in the top 10 for chances created his points per 90 is 447 its decent but its not crazy this is where i think watching games having a bit of making sure youre watching different teams not just your team when theyre theyre on tv and using the eye test is clear because rogers to me is looking like he could be one of the if he made team of the season the way hes playing at the moment i dont think anyone would be would be too surprised he is so key to everything aston villa are trying to build whether its in europe and he was i think he was man of the match in the game the other night every game ive seen him play hes demanding the ball hes making the runs his end product is maybe lacking a little bit and i think if he starts adding those goals to his game what is his potential for five milli hes never going to be a palmer were never going to have a palmer again i dont think at five million but if rogers goes on and could get 170 180 points and kick on from where he is now hes goingon to go down as one of the best value picks of all time and i think thats more likely that trajectory for him than he gets phased out and doesnt become a an impact for us so if youre listening to this and you havent got rogers youre always going to have other priorities maybe to go for the big hitters and the moving around but when it comes to saving money and you want to bring some money out of maybe some of the other midfielders even if the pictures arent that good i still would suggest that you take a look at rogers because i just think hes hes hes an absolutely unreal player and i wonder how long its goingon to be to gets caught up for england surely hes got to be ts got to be looking at that and thinking hes a player that can offer us something a little bit different because if you think about de bry for city and the way he can get the ball in midfield and just drive forward we need more players like that in the in the england squad from that central role that maybe hunt foden because foden has never delivered for england so rogers had to had to mention him the other player i wanted to mention here just move on is fatu as well of leicester thought he changed the game when he came on against southampton i know harrys got madidi hes i saw his podcast where he was wondering why hes hes got him i dont think he was a bad pick at all i was tempted to go there at the start of the season theres now other five options who are looking a bit better with jamie vardy with madidi and with fatua theyve got some real players that can hurt teams and again hes not one youre gonna buy now but i think hes hes someone to watch because hes got that explosiveness in him where over this run of games lester have got once we see him naed in that team i do wonder if he could present a bit of an interesting alternative but well have to wait and see a little bit on him forwards so this is the interesting position im stacked in my forward spot ive got harand 15m for him 10 goals three consecutive blanks but the stats are just absolutely obscene as they always will be over the season its more of a blip isnt it weve already seen the champions league hes gonna hes hes hes going to revert back to form pretty soon ive got watkins who i know quite a few people maybe have maybe bend off in the last few weeks hes been doing well for me there is some concerns that hes getting benched a bit earlier than youd like 65 70 minutes he did was benched in the champions league game as well duran got his sure its not his first start is it maybe i think it is his first other than other than the cup but we imagine watkins is going to come back in good game against bournemouth then its away at spurs as well i dont hate even those fixures for him then its probably a case of moving him on to a palmer when those fixtures turn around so harand slanky and and watkins im pretty stacked up top i do think im missing a bit of a trick with some of the cheaper forwards weve mentioned quite a few of these already i think jimenez is the standout for me four goals and assists for him hes in that purple patch era that he was he was in before his awful head injury hes an incredible player all his day f are playing well eight points per 90 for someone that costs 57m is just an absolute bargain so i think if you are considering one of these cheaper strikers hes probably the one to go for i think we rule out cal lein i know the fix is good he cant score youve got to be able to score and he cant we look at we look at coa as well given the fixures have turned around for him the importance that hes got in that side i dont mind that i dont mind strand larson if you want to go down even further and save a bit of money i wonder if the ship sailed a little bit on chriswood given the fixtures i think he should do all right against leicester i would back him to score in that its just from that the fixtures arent great if he does score against lee hes going to be popular given his given his price to be fair its west ham and newcastle its not a bad run is it then if switch in 13 i take it back hes i reckon hes probably still a good pick up even after even after leicester but leicester west ham and newcastle then ni switch in 13 is he better than gimenez know let me think let me let me know would you rather go jimenez or or wood go m forward probably is quite close between them isnt it i think id go those two overa for some reason i thought wood had like tough games coming up but hes other that arsenal game they all look pretty decent so hes hes definitely a consideration the stats arent arent too great other than that not a huge amount of options is there isack was someone i thought could end up being in our teams all season that injury was it going to take for him to become a bit of a consideration for us probably quite a lot vs back in contention for brenford the fixures arent bad for him either 77 ex with 90 was very popular before the injury that he had again i think theres probably better options in there and whats happened with mata i owned mata earlier in the season i got that brace from him were all talking about the fact that he was it the second most go goal since glasner took over but unceremoniously dropped and getu is getting the nod so i wonder know how long thats going to go on for i dont think mata can be too happy when palace arent scoring goals and hes been dropped and hes being such a key man for them trigger lips is in the chat he ask who im talking to thats a good question trick i do often wonder that as well im just here talking to myself pretty much as as the views have gone up to 705 thanks for all sticking with me and cheers ive missed these solo streams theres something theres something a little bit theyre relaxing in the way but also a littleit bit frantic because you youve got to keep talking you cant have too much time just to sit and have like a silence when you bring in someone when youre the hosting and you bring someone else in you can have a little bit of a pause have a

website that weve got which if youre a godfather team member you can track all the predictions that youre that youre putting in and see how you compare to others they built us this graphic so mark and i can track our predictions and enter them in where would we be without the community and its been a bit of a tough week for me in the community this week for anyone thats following that but theres so much of it that i that i i still love and still enjoy so do just want to say thanks for anyone whos whos helped out mark and i because it does it does mean a lot to us just someones point out theyre not in order which is br w stop chris this was something that i learned from james last week that the games that so the three oclock games for example are in alphabetical order so it would be aston villa brenford brighton man city its just not something id ever thought about but it is weird them not being its that does this so lee if youre watching this from australia make sure these are now best cl or people are going to start kicking off lets ratt through these though its ler forest tomorrow night im playing moreno i dont feel too good about it i think forest probably win this game i think woods gonna get something out of it as well but i think leicester scor they scored in every match so far its a great comeback against southampton too but i think forest have just got a bit about them at the moment i think theyre defense is nice i like minkovich and i like murillo ss is looking like a decent goalkeeper now too theyve got good attacking options theyve theyve built the team around getting wood service and i think theyll theyll won this one out i do think leer are picking up though id written them off maybe at the start of the season but i think theyve got options and i think out of the three promoted teams theyre by far the most likely to stay up man city southampton this is going to be a blood bath surely ive gone for a 40 so as mark i have harand trible captain in my team currently i think they score multiple goals i think southampt are going try and low block but i also dont think theyre going to change their philosophy passing around the back i unless they completely change the way they play i think theyre still going to try and kick it around and try and find a bit of space i dont think theyve got a good out ball to get the ball to and i think city going to exploit it with the pressure that theyve got and the players theyve got i just think its going to be a tough day for southampton so 40 hopefully some foden and lewis involved but harand getting all four of those goals would be lovely brighton wolves i think we win this and if you remember matas solo goal he scored last season one of the best goals i think ive ever seen great for a repeat on that i was impressed with brighton given that we had players come out for international break we had like m injured wck went off injured we had weve had pro weve had like thumpings from chelsea weve recovered its been a exciting season already for us im impressed with r i think hes a hes a real differential if youre looking for someone completely different for a onewe punt and i think well have a bit too much for wolves but i like wolves and i want to see them start getting some points that they that they deserve so ive gone for ive gone for two one here and its its a 31 for mark brenford ip switch greaves is out i think this could be a big win for brenford again i quite like it switch so maybe ive gone a little bit a little bit lower than maybe i should have done twonil for them marks gone for a 30 inmo should come out of this with something good got the brace against southampton and the fellow promoted team i think he could do very well in this one so if you havent got inmo i think if i harlands the biggest concern if you havent got him but i think bs got to be up there right im expecting him to come away from this with a with a double digit villa bournemouth very impressed with bournemouth so far this season i think that defeat against leicester was surprising but in other games theyve looked good ive gone for twonil villa and this one though theyre another team i just think theyll theyll get the win in this and looking at those defensive numbers surely at some point the clean sheets are going to come marks given bournemouth a goal in this a twonil for villa with rogers and watkins would be lovely as the dream result for me last time with both of them scoring this a shame rogers seems to get booked every time he scores or it would have been a bigger hall everton fham ive gone for a 21 fulam marks gone for a 11 see theres a bit about everton at the moment start pick up a couple of wins a couple of clean sheets in the last two games two i just think the form of himz with smith row supplying is going to be enough to see them through on this i think we might start regretting selling smith row i know a lot of us have done if youve still got him i think hes still a perfectly fine hold to have in your team so im backing f him in this one west ham man united i think of all the teams ive been least impressed with this season southampton probably bottom of my list and then west ham close to second bottom i just think theyre so easy to play against like you look at the space they were allowing spurs to have in that game why arent they packing the midfield why arent they making attempts to try and stifle like creative players like kazki was just given license just to completely run the show very strange and its not the first time weve seen them do that against chelsea i thought they were poor as well i think ipswitch flattered them the way he switch played and approached that game i just think its not a great its not a great time for them at the moment and i know man united playing tonight there a bit about them with hiling back weve gone at you in the fores in so im backing them to get that to get that one if there was a garden center game and thats what js says i think it probably is the west ham man united game though isnt it i wouldnt be canceling my plans to to to watch that one palace spurs ive gone for two1 spurs mars gone for 30 spurs i think if spurs were to win this 30 i think glar is going to start fearing for his job which seems unheard of after the end of the season they had last time out 30 no slanky no johnson and no no porro involvement i think that would be pretty unlikely i think this is the game we start seeing some points for johnson and sanki i think both are good picks going into this palace fans might start turning on their players a little bit you just never know what youre going to get with spur so if palace if palace score i dont think its going to be too surprising chelsea newcastle im jealous of palmer this week hes someone that i want in my team i look him every week and think hes hes got great potential hes getting one assist and getting bonus i thought he played well against liverpool as well i cant see any way he doesnt get something from this game havent been impress with newcastle they got the clean sheet against everton away but other than that they very rarely keep away clean sheets and chelsea are doing very well on the the expected goal involvement table for teams so im backing chelsea to win this i wouldnt be surprised if pmer had a same both of these goals and comes away with a big ho so definitely consider definitely consider of bringing him in if you dont already and then arsenal liverpool interesting game no celba for arsenal liverpool looking strong going to be a hell of an atmosphere at the emirates for this one i think a draw is probably the most likely given that new team is going to want to lose this one i think we have to consider liverpool as a title contender this year along with arsenal along with man city its going to be those three right at the top so i think i think arsenal will take a draw in this given that cbas out liverpool will probably be hoping they can they can create a few problems for arsenal when then get something marks gone for 21 in this for liverpool so we can see how that how that one goes i mentioned the prediction standings you can get involved in this if youre blackbox patron mark is currently beating me which is very frustrating with his 55 correct outcomes 9 correct scores im on 49 so ive gone under my 50 target but i have i think ive got one more correct score than mark has so mines mines at 10 im having to extend this list each time just to keep me on it so i definitely need to start picking up hottin is winning this with his total score of 73 59 correct outcome and 16 correct score incred and hes missed six matches and hes still top so congratulations to him andy who was on earlier hes just ahead of me hes on the 50 target 10 correct score so well done well done to him but if youre interested in getting involved in this head over to the blackbox patreon sign up and we can get you involved in in this competition theres a trophy for the for the winner which hottin is currently winning captain c this is it all just points to har doesnt it mean scks touch in the box for 90 106 his shots in the box is 31 those stats are encouraging for sacka but hes playing liverpool and hes a doubt so you cant consider him harlands next his 10 goals we dont need to talk about him hes going to be captured by pretty much everyone other than james from plan fpl who wont own him dont know who hes going to go for i imagine hes going to go for palmer with newcastle at home he could go for slanky away at palace given his spurs connection but i dont think he will i think hes probably going to go for palmer in thats who i go for if i didnt have harland fodens on this list as well if you think hes going to start and play centrally i think hes a potential option if you havent got harland we mentioned inmo as well home to ipswitch i think hes a good pick with his six goals this season but i think personally the question is do we captain or do we triple captain and as i said i think im leaning towards the triple captain this week this was my team i showed this earlier with andy the triple captain chip isnt active on this but it come is in my main team my move is going to be seeno to garnacho this week benching gabrielle playing ry trent lewis moreno foden ando garnacho rogers harland probably triple captain watkins and sanki so im hoping for a decent green arrow this week thats pretty much all the content ive got for this stream more than happy to i got two beers i think it was a bit optimistic and bar even started this one its hard to drink and talk to be fair if you want to get any questions in for me ill try and answer as many as i can ive got a couple of super chats to get through too so thank you for sending those in and thanks for sticking around theres 677 people watching live if you could drop a like on the video that would be amazing if youre watching this post youtube drop us a comment as well let us know if you enjoyed it and if youre listening on the podcast give us a festar review and drop us a review on that too these things like i keep saying about the community and how great it is being a being a i hate the phrase content creator but i dont know what else to call myself with this because i do create content it just feels like a bit of a wanky term but its a funny experience because i love it and i love talking football and i love doing blackbox with mark and i love interacting with people and stuff but there are times when it gets you down a little bit ive ive had quite i think ive probably had more negativity over the last couple of seasons than ive had in any other year that ive done it i think a lot of it does relate to rank and had a poor season last year its getting a little bit better this year but its not great is its not begging for compliments and stuff but its its nice to know that people enjoy the the podcast and the streams and things and ultimately if people werent enjoying them and they didnt they didnt like it then you would wouldnt bother the reason why mark and i stick around is because hopefully were were doing something that people like and we keep enjoying as long as those two things keep happening then then we carry on its some sometimes a bit a bit demoralizing sometimes but going private i think on twitter is definitely helping right lets take a look at andrew g thank you for the 499 super chat evening chats im 42m ive been there mate do not worry saaka diaz gabrielle and calv luin to palma foden gimenez and at nori for a minus 12 what i am i losing the plot a minus 12 i have taken a minus 12 twice in my life and both times it has not gone well i look at the four players youre looking at palmer foden himz and eight nory i like all four of those i look at the four youre taking out and think is there massive potential that they go off over the next few weeks saaka diaz gabrielle and calv lein sacas a doubt diaz has got tough fixtures and has missed out the last couple of games gabrielles got tough fixes k cant score i dont i dont hate it i dont hate it andrew if youve still got the wild card maybe its time to think about using that but if you havent im finding it hard to say no to it youre 42m youve got foden at 66 ownership youve got palmer whos a great pick himene in great form go for it im gonna say go for it unbelievable i like it andrew im not going to try and talk you a bit i know its for a minus 12 but i think its its big improvement to the rest of your squad caleb is in the chat caleb is one of our patreon tier members dont ask him for his opinion on goalkeepers because hes absolutely bloody useless picking them and hes asking me for a goalkeeper move reyya to onana god just stick with reyya caleb i know youve broken him and youre youre not seeing any joy from him but i still maintain arsenal are going to be one of the best defenses in the league theyve had three red cards in eight games its been a bit of some freaker occurrences i just think i know the fixures arent great but if arsenal do keep a clean sheet in the next couple of games hes gna have made a couple of saves and be in the bonus and man utd defensively im i know theyve theyve been theyve been okay but i dont fully trust them i would just leave it youre going to keep chasing goalkeeper halles youre going to miss out on ones from your own team ray is a good goalkeeper i would i would just stay with him davies family first play one of robinson or davis and one of seeno or smith row id definitely play smith row against everton so i think that ones quite easy id probably play robinson as well i think robinson and smith row i if you do i dont hate playing robinson and seeno but i would i would think that ive got film to beat ive got film to beat everton so i think play your two filam assets there theyre a good team this season hing good to see hing al some one of our patreon members is it worth a minus four to sw sacka to son hope to pay for your beer as all youre very kind is it worth a minus four to swap sacka to s thats a tough one again if we get a leak the cartel gets a leak sack is out it probably is it depends on your benches isnt it you might have a decent player on your ben if youve got seeno on your bench id probably just play him bring him in minus fours are tricky to get right depends what your what your plans are for some long term if youre going to look to get rid of him for palmer or someone in a few weeks its probably not worth it if you think youre going to keep him right up to game week 134 it might be the move to make id be a bit reluctant to take a minus four to swap sacka out i think sacka is gonna come back into consideration in a few weeks if he lines up against liverpool you might be wanting him back straight away id hold unless youre 5050 or less that hes not going to play and then you can consider it depending on who that bench on who that bench option is i wont read yours out super duper just because its i dont want to mention the person that youre talking about fbo gold you mark its a its a nice soy one you mark credit to the f community ignore the likes of a certain someone im sure you discussed foden but whats a summary im avoiding the summary is ive got him im happy with him i think he starts i think he plays centrally i cant see him playing on the left or on the right i dont think thats where pep wants to use him i spoke to luke about it luke thinks foden is at risk when pep wants to make sure hes got control of the midfield and if hes playing against like a combative side in midfield then he might be someone who drops out like we saw with wolves against southampton hes not anticipating much of a midfield battle and normi so hes hes pretty sure that fen is going to start in that i just think ranks are pretty low its game week eight we can take a punt on someone youve got sacka with tough fixtures and potentially injured know salah as well son is he the best option i dont know i just think theres theres there might not be too many opportunities to go for someone like foden because of all the other options that weve got and against southampton i dont think theres theres many better punts we know what hes capable of hes an absolutely like unbelievable worldclass player on his day and hes playing the worst team in the league i genuinely think they are the worst team in the league so go for it i think its its pretty safe matthew perry and die for wha or just play it safe with wood just go for wood just go for wood i think thats an easy one i think given what ive learned about the fixtures tonight im a bit worried about the oing wood and again i wouldnt dont think id be saying that at the start of the season whist is a fine pick but hes been injured we dont know g what were going to get we know exactly what were going to get for wood were going to get an attack who are basing their team around getting service so i think im afraid its a pretty boring answer for me in that and dr david 1963 agrees there you go sam v says bri play wolves already this year wasnt easy 31 dont know why everyones piling on 8 nory this week no i think you can wait a week on him i think people are piling on him because theyre getting rid of trent and gabrielle or cba and its not that obvious to nowhere to go if you looking for the medium to long term he has got the attacking threat who else you go for we talk about how theres a bit of a lack of options at four five like a mikeno like that you get in a nory hes probably going to concede against brian id be very surprised if we didnt score in that but i wouldnt be too surprised if he got an attacking return and then i think he is the best four fiveish option defender so i could i can see why people are going for that lets see if theres any more questions before i call it ab says about edison is killing me now cant keep clean yep you and praz both i think its hes not someone that ive ever wanted to own but then again i thought ray would do the job and he hasnt either so its its a bit of a shame and ill take one more question if the question is just from trigger hard rested for stones this week i hope not trig considering im expecting to play the triple captain on him mo says good sol at this bit of a strange one not had to do a the black box solo before not sure whats happening next week i think mark said he might not even be around next week as well which im sure will upset quite a few people might see if luk or andys around hopey andy wont have another delivery it was a bit last minute with mark because hopefully pip isnt listening but mark forgot until about 7 pm last night and was like my god i just realized its pips birthday so i hope i hope hes treated as something nice ive met pip and she she puts up a lot with that man bless him i love you mark right im going to call it there thank you all for sticking with me its amazing to know that weve stuck around 700 people watching even though ive been just chatting on my on my own sorry for the technical issues at the start hopefully the graphics were okay on this stream and ill be back next week with someone not toly sure who its going to be but ill definitely be back next week and good luck this game week if you are triple captaining harland i hope he goes absolutely mad for you and same if youve got foden too because they will be the deci side whether i come into next pretty happy or pretty miserable anyway thats it from me thank you and see you next week
22,FPLBlackBox,6-iZUPoTq2o,FPL Son Error? | GW8,2024-10-21T22:51:37Z,[Music] my word I don't know really where to begin uh it was a horrible Saturday for fbl and certainly for my fbl team and I guess we got to start with the sacka situation um from my perspective I was um I was away all week in Bulgaria that's why I didn't do the the blackbox stream and so I was I had limited time to soak up information and team news and so on I I caught some Friday night got got back that that evening land you know looked at my team on Saturday and I was basically going to roll my transfer U Where I Stood on Saturday I was I was kind of 80% certain that he would start because as we know he's had knocks in the past and the comments from carsle artetta were we're positive let's face it so I thought he was I was certainly 8020 thinking he was going to start at Bournemouth um then obviously I rolled the transfer but I almost wavered so 15 minutes before deadline I saw a tweet from what I thought was a reliable source Charles Watts uh which actually turned out to be Boer if you don't know booner account on Twitter who posts a kind of troll post to kind of misleading team news as a joke you know a joke yeah it can be funny to be fair and and this was one of his tweets and I fell for it so I put that tweet in The Godfather tier chat to try and help people in there that you know this tweet was out there it's public just in case you ain't seen it 15 minutes ago saca's not playing I then went to my desk went to take sacker out put son in because um it was It was obviously looking like he was going to start I mean he was he was back to Fitness and it was a a risk worth taking with the fixtures that Spurs had and then I looked at whatsapp and there it was as was saying among others that that was a a boa post and it was fake so I didn't make the transfer cuz I was back to thinking 8020 sacka would start turns out that as saw my post thought it was weird as well made the transfer then realized too late it was a fake one I don't know crazy um and then of course didn't turn up uh and I didn't get son and we'll talk about son and the assisted a bit but the the rest his history of course sacker didn't turn up and then it turns out a load of content creators made last minute changes which I'm not surprised about um I'm particularly not surprised about because then after the deadline I watched the Arsenal fan TV Video in which they one of the content creators on there if you can call them that said that sack was was a major doubt and wouldn't play now had I seen that before deadline that for me would have made me 50/50 no smoke without fire and then I would have made the transfer to song cuz 50/50 would be enough for me but I didn't see it I didn't know that but what I can say is if I was among the content creators or other people who saw that in advance of deadline then I would have made that s transfer so I think it's fair enough so all these people accusing content creators having secret information I think it's pretty unfair because I can only go on what I know I didn't get any secret information and had I seen that Arsenal fan TV I'd have been 50/50 and I'd have made the transfer the song cuz logically it makes sense with this with the fixtures so I can only stand up for that view that it was all open and above board and a logical decision and of course you're going to make the decision late because you're going to wait till the final moment in case you do get a leak in case you do get public information that's going to sway you like sacker scene at the ground or something so it's all understandable but I didn't benefit from it I didn't make the change because I thought he was going to start and I didn't see that Arsenal fan TV clip which for me that would have been enough cuz it suggested that there was an itk out there who had information and it would have just tipped me 50/50 and I would have made that transfer but anyway I hope I hope that's not a slid indoors moment for my season it has been a terrible game week I went into the Arsenal Bournemouth game obviously with sacka with CBA and with Gabrielle celba got the red card sacka didn't turn up and Arsenal lost the game 2-0 obviously celba red card means he's out against Liverpool which is a major blow to them in that game and it means that I'll probably have to sell celba now with the two tree transfers I've got ahead of the next game week um as for Bournemouth you mean seeno was a stand out against six shots one chance created he's now had 37 shots 10 more than any other m Fielder uh and in the end they won the game with a training ground set piece played AR at their own game a very good corner and a penalty uh it's now four out clean sheet for Arsenal and it's Liverpool Newcastle and Chelsea in the next three I think that I don't think I'm holding sacka it's a hamstring injury could he could miss that game I think I'm going to be moving him out and it's going to be ca going as well so with those fixtures and with a kind of dip in form and confidence I'm definitely moving away from [Music] Arsenal and then there's the son assist um yeah so basically the way I see it is uh the error here is on the tributing the own goal to arola um because I think once once you recognize that it's an arola own goal rather than a TBO own goal you recognize that final touch that arola had and then that means that son shot has the initial save from arola Ricochet back off to Theo then the Final Touch from marola which was pivotal enough to be cited as a means to give him the own goal so that's three touches the rul say that for an assist to be awarded from an own goal the player awarded the assist has to directly Force the own goal now I don't think in this case you can say that because by giving it to ARA's known goal we're recognizing that his touch is a significant one presumably too's touch back towards goal wasn't on Target and it was ARA's final touch that b it to B it to be a goal so therefore sunshot didn't directly lead to that go it was too's touch back the Ricochet off too too from the Save the initial save Mariola which was what forced the own goal the finals hch from marola therefore for me it's no assist now had had it been a tobo own goal I'd be more sympathetic I think it would be an assist then because for me the Sun Shop would force to save the Ricochet off to Debo and in but because they've said arola a goal they've recognize that third touch I don't think we can say son directly cost it therefore it's no assist for me and there is Presidents here if you go back to 2022 first game of the season Manchester United ball comes off the back of Dow towards the bright and goal Sanchez saves it onto mallister but mallister knocks the ball in for an own goal to mallister no assist was given to Dow even though Dow's touch was sending the ball goldw and it was Sanchez who saved it onto Mall but no assist was given to Dow he didn't benefit because presumably they felt that Dow's touch didn't force the own goal cuz mallister got the own goal and it was Sanchez's Save which forced the own goal but it's the same here it's tobo's touch back the Ricochet back to arola that forces the own goal therefore to be consistent with that incident in 2022 it's no assist now what's crazy is it was no assist and then at 9:00 for some reason an assist was added and a tweet went out the Tweet was later removed because there was a lot of negative reaction to it I stayed out of that but I I just don't see it can be awarded assist if you're going to be consistent with what was gone before there's another incident the gapbo incident from last year against West Ham arola own goal again ironically he had a shot that was off Target but that doesn't matter the shot came off of ogbon onto such on the line and off of arola for an own goal arola own goal then as well nothing was given to GPO because his shot didn't directly forc the own goal from Mariola if anything it was such's touch on the line which forced the own goal so it's the same again son shot didn't directly Force the own goal because it was a touch back the Ricochet off tobo that made arola score the own goal because it was credited to him now I don't think it should have been credited to him I think that's the mistake and in that case it would have been an assist in my book but arola and goal no assist for [Music] me as for the game itself obviously son came out with a goal and assist came out with 0.47 xgi five shots two chances created a decent game you look good in spells but it was Johnson who came out with a top xgi .93 overall five shots All In The Box again looked to threet and it's just that shot volume in the box that really intrigues me he's had 26 shots this season all of them in the penalty area and in the end that volume you know that's got to offer value going forward Madison has been a consideration but he won off at halim tactical decision by an to bring sa on and that was the trigger for the turnaround in the second half and and Spurs just blew West Ham away so Johnson continues to catch the eye I may go him over son of a bit more time this week if I if it is sacka who does make way ahead of Liverpool game depending of whether sacka turns up for midweek European game of course uh the other player to talk about here sanky really concerning just one shot one chance created had a look at the average position Maps he was the deepest of all the Spurs attacker so ahead so with Madison kuresi Johnson and Son all four of them ahead of salanki in terms of the touches the average touches that they had on the pitch and you can see it with the it test he was coming deep he was linking play Runners getting Beyond him he wasn't getting the end of things that as I said one shot one chance that's not enough 0.12 xgi is a concern I'm already thinking that despite the fixtures I don't know if he's going to deliver the kind of volume of points that I need from him and you know moveing havs after Arsenal's fixtures um soften up a bit might be the way to go I think um as for West Ham um I know actually two more players I want to is is porro and a doggy went forward and pouring forward loads porro in particular really scares me not having him he had for shots and two chances created on the day a doggy three chances created and got the assist but porro for me is the eye catcher 16 shots now the top amongst Defenders this season that volume has got to pay off I mean even without clean sheets I think he's a player that we need to keep on our adars and I think with the fixtures that Spurs have got I may well be moving CBA down to him depending on how the budget goes for me uh West Ham now yeah Kudos got the goal well taken but then got the red card so he's out for three games and that's painful for West H because their fixtures are better now but they're going to miss Kudos who is obviously is a big outlet for them uh Bowen could have got the assist his cross to Kudos did take a Def flection and it did look as though it was intended for Antonio I can see why it wasn't given harsh low for Boeing owners those brave enough to go for the differential missing out on points again and we kidos out I just think that Bo and Ro remain a very lowly owned differential so Everton won 2N at Portman Road um a big fixture for it which they I found wanting um I I starting to fear for them I I did have some good feelings about the liks of the lap and Davis going into a better fixture run but 3.89 now is their XG for the season it's the lowest in the division by quite a margin Davis came out with three chances created and he does have 20 chances created for the season more than any other Defender but I just see them scoring enough goals for him to convert that into assists dap has got four goals and he came out with a couple of shots in this game but I think it 0.18 his XG and Davis was 0.23 just too low and and Everton had too much for him in Midfield and they cope well of them at the back and in the end ran out at a caner um for them Calvin Le was the stand out in terms of xgi 1.32 he had five shots in the game Big frustration for calv L owners that he came out of a blank he had a couple of one-on ones which M did well with but yeah Cav L really should have profited M Neil got an assist now created 25 chances for the season second only to sacker amongst midfielders so he continues to offer value Kean got the other goal obviously he could be an option at the back but bran Freight is near in Fitness I guess mikeno would be the better option he came back in to the side at left back did play deep didn't get forward too much but at 4-3 he's got to be worth a look now that Everton fixes continued to be decent pford low back-to-back clean sheets is e the answer for those who don't have ryar or for those who are giving up on Ry after asked on conceding goals certainly um it's a good it's a good couple of game weeks for pford and and Everton and suddenly they're starting to look like they could be a source of value to us as well andai got the goal but it was some an error he's another one we could keep an eye on as a cheap forward option um and again just going back to itwi you know they did make errors nine errors now for the season the most of any team actually it's level with sampton and those defensive errors coupled with the fact they can't score goals could take them down half fought victory for Villa at craen Cottage Rogers came in with his third goal in the season could have had more Mr sitter before half time and came out with three shots .88 xgi which the pass Watkins .41 he got his goal over and just two shots smartly taken header from matan's corner and then V Villa sealed it with an own goal um as for Fulham I mean jenez was a standout again he's now returned in five successive games got the goal here four goals and one assist now in the last five for him could have had an assist as well if it wasn't for pereira's Miss penalty because jnez forced the hand ball could be significant that because it was such a badly taken penalty from Andes Pereira that himz could step in now and take them to ad to his appeal even more 5.7 Fulham have still got good fixtures I mean he looks like he's going a new lease of life which is great to see obviously a for FPL Legend at walls born again at Fulham definitely a consideration with the fixures that Fulham have got and and the confidence they're playing with I don't think this defeat Dilla will be a major setback are we finally going to get to look at some man united attackers maybe I mean it was a a good showing from the front three against brenford run out two- One winners rashford gacho and hland all starting to click maybe or hinting at something uh hland came into the side and did impress he had three shots not 43 one chance created as well got his well taken goal from a lovely Bruno assist only a second Return of the season for Bruno owners there uh I guess gacha was a stand out load 10 shot creation uh involvements in the game week more than any other player that's eight shots and two chances created only .43 xgo it shows you that perhaps the quality of the chance wasn't great but there's potential here we know about garnacho hland needs games and needs consistency but maybe maybe just first shoots of some progress that means we can start to consider United in the future there's five good fixes to come as well so who knows maybe not for me at the moment but one to monitor that's for sure as for brenford they capitalized on delit off the pitch to score from a corner that set piece thre is always there pinnick second goal of the Season uh nothing too much more to talk about really and bumo was kept quiet Vandenberg started it right back again in the four and looks like it could be an option and Visa was back on the bench got 30 minutes at the end good fixure still the next three it s fman bouth Visa at 5.9 could it be Al budget forward option I meant to say fleen got nine saves in that game now he's made more saves 42 than any other keeper Hanson of Leicester is is second and he was involved in a ridiculous game at St Mar's where Leicester run out 3-2 winners having been two-nil down at halim Great result for Steve Cooper side of course disaster for Russell Martins in this game it's Brian nut again who stood out five shots three chances created 1.45 xgi the highest in the game week he started out playing out on the on the right flank then when Fatu came on um everything changed for two really did make an impact very Lively in 31 minutes .51 xgi uh two shots and one chance created he had his Pace really frightened s Anon and helped turn the game around bonan went to a central role number 10 got the first goal back and played a part those two played a part in the comeback and and well it's just tragic for for sa Anon they've as I said made nine errors now six leading to goals the most in the division really look suspect at set plays as well I think it's 5.6 XG conceded at set plays the highest in the league and they got caught right at the end again Rell Martin seems to have a trouble on these Corners he he he piles men into the box but leaves the edge of the Box free and that's what Lester did and they scored the equalizer Assa the winner R IU to go three to up before that Archer got his second in successive games uh and well could could maybe another budget option if you would need to go down to 5 million an intered Manning 4-3 Defender appeared to play left wing um so they had dibling on one flank Manning on the other so he was played out of position but mean while s hun look as brle as they do even on outter position Defender playing up front is not going to tempt us is it super one- nil win for Brighton at Newcastle wellber with his fifth goal of the season um second now only a Harland amongst forwards but did pick up a back injury so that's one to monitor if you're eying out well back for your forward lines um yeah I mean a great a great victory for Brighton they did it without matoma who started on the bench after International Duty that's one to look for herzler obviously looks to give players a rest after interal break so that's worth noting matoma came on though and he's still the standout player amongst that Brighton team for me as for Newcastle well they had plenty of chances they dominated the first half isach had nine shot involvements alog together seven shots two chances created for 0.88 xgi similarly golden four shots three chances created for 0.7 xgi those two we really need to come into form again to give us those options but I mean they've typified Newcastle this season just so erratic no consistency flat deceive and eak really needs to find these shooting boots 8.3 it would be quite something if him and Gordon could come alive again so that's all of Saturday's games covered I've got four players today uh foden Harland captain and Lewis against wolves and then Trent playing Chelsea later I need some points I've only got 14 I think it is with seeno coming off the bench for sacka at the moment so it looks like a miserable game week and a red arrow for me but I'm not alone low scores everywhere it's one of those game weeks I think you did well if you had broken 20 points from Saturday's games as has of course but I don't want to talk about that uh then we've got Forest Palace on Monday night so I might have to do that one from the shed to get this out in time so look out for that but that's all from me now and I'll see you in the morning good morning so Harem blanks for third successive game the first time he's ever done that in his Man City career not only that he had very few touches no shots at all no chances created it's only the third time in his career that he's had a game with zero shots when starting the last time was game we against Arsenal last season so that's it's a long time ago big regression he's had zero big chances in those three blanks where he had 10 big chances in the in the five games before that that shows the aggression for those who wild carded him in and that includes me of course Man City overall just struggled to break walls down I I thought they lacked any penetration from out wide despite playing doku and Savio greish and foden came off the bench to pep it up a little bit but they were they were devoid of ideas got the win of course foden got the assist from the corner from a from the stones header which was perhaps a bit fortuitous given the V check but overall City just huffed and puffed were a bit ploty a bit predictable and struggled um but what do we do we've got to hold fodm we've got to hold Harland we got to hold Lewis we've got to hold gardio ahead of Southampton in game week nine um that is such a plum fixure the way that sa an are playing of course and varol yeah got uh second goal of the Season uh 28 touches in the box now um I think he's just behind a doggy and Lewis for that he continues to be a goal threat and that compensates for the lack of clean sheets that City get in but I don't know um I think I've got to wait until deyne comes back to assess what I do with my man city assets I think foden if he's not going to be a reliable starter and I guess Sunday showed that I might have to think again on him and he might be the one to make way if I'm looking at Palmer [Music] Liverpool got the victory very difficult game against Chelsea uh thought Chelsea did very well but Liverpool got the win in the end Salah with the hall double figure return decimated our ranks that did um only had the two shots two chances created 0.14 ex non penalty but of course got the penalty I think he's first of the season and then the assist for the the Curtis Jones goal uh yeah overall I think think uh I guess the major news elsewhere was Diaz was benched perhaps expected after the international break that's something we got to look for that that slot will do and it kind of puts another question mark over him as a potential asset and then in the game J got injured after half an hour and got replaced by Darwin so he's got an injury now so all of a sudden our options in that Liverpool attack a cut back to maybe just s but oh we going there with Palmer and Harland and and sacka on the list as well son of course so foden I haven't but yeah there's so many Heavy Hitters now demanding of our of those Midfield slots and our money that that Sal has obviously slipped off the the ownership and that's why he's hold did so much damage to us elsewhere Trent is a concern as well maybe he's someone who's going to give way as we look to pursue those Heavy Hitters no chances created in this game he's only created three chances over the last three games had four shots so no xgi from Trent in this game and so you can't blame now people to waiver on him it's Arsenal obviously next which is a difficult game are we going to get anything from Trent then the fixtures do improve after that but given his price and his output at the moment you can't blame people for looking elsewhere uh as for Chelsea parba was kept fairly quiet by Curtis Jones I thought he came out with four shots three in the box .56 xgi and he is top now for midfielders for xgi non penalty so he he's still got to remain a Target despite this being a difficult game for him as I said Curtis Jones did a good job on him in Midfield and Jackson came out of his fifth goal the season um he 5.7 extra non penalty over the season now second only to Harland amongst forwards yeah there could be potential in this Chelsea side beon Palmer um but he's got to remain the key Target surely just ended at the city ground Forest win one- nil good performance and Chris Wood with the winner and let's let's talk about chriswood unbelievable he's now been involved in 62% of forest goals with on the pitch 7 8% shot accuracy 11 of his 16 shots been on target I mean conversion rate of 31% it's just incredible he continues to deliver why don't I have him in my team it's it just seems crazy doesn't it um a one- nil win looks like Sals is going to come out with a maximum bonus though I think he made six saves on the night including two worldies one from eay one from schook did really well um and a clean sheet again I think that's our third clean sheet cheat of the season um yeah really happy with that result uh and from a forest point of view yeah it's wood and SS who the standouts I guess minkovich and Millo clean sheets again Ana I mean yeah any of the back four look options but CS is beginning to look like potentially the four or five keeper to go for which you at one point I thought he wouldn't keep his place but he he's put in performances out the bag now uh and all credit to him um and then Chris Wood yeah up front as you said elsewhere without gives white not a lot in Midfield Anderson played well won a lot of jewels but not a lot of yeah nothing not not fancy potential and E I think he had five shots again only one from inside the Box he's had 32 shots now second only to cenia among midfielders but he just you know he's denied by a couple of Sayes but again it's just it's just not working for Palace is it nothing is going in for e and keto was poor in the first half Mata apparently he's not fit although I don't know how they get ineta and mateta in the same team no they're in trouble I mean they're too good to go down surely but they they're certainly in a fight now um so yeah um a good final game Forest good final game for me from a game week that's been terrible 26 points looks like I'm going down to 2.5 million although there is going to be a change in points because the Premier League today announced that they're going to remove son's assist I think that will drop into one bonus as well so maybe that'll affect my rank as well good decision by the Premier League and really important that they've gone back and corrected that um obviously if you've watched the video you've seen that I yeah I did think that was a wrong decision um and they've come to that conclusion and corrected it and that's big for the game because it means that we can get decisions now that go wrong earlier corrected later in the game week right up until the end of end of the game week an hour after the game week on a Monday night in this occasion so that's really good for the future of the game really good that they've done that right decision I think for the reasons I said still think it's a mistake me not getting son though I still think i' made an eror there um because obviously I would have got some points instead of someo Off the Bench for only a couple and and I think I'm going to end up looking at son for this game week because sacka doesn't look like he was in training today for the European tie against Shaka so I'm gonna have to get rid of sacka and son could be on the menu so I've missed out on the points that he did get this week by doing that just a chain of events on Saturday me not being about enough last week being too busy at work to soak up the team news and and all the info on sacker as I said I've got to get better got to get better than 2.5 million uh I'll be back with blackbox with has later in the week if you enjoyed this video like And subscribe sorry there wasn't too much scenery in there with the weather it was really difficult and I was pushed for time so hopefully when I do the next one the weather's better and I can get more of that in there like I say like And subscribe see you next time,5465,5239,my word i dont know where to begin it was a horrible saturday for fbl and certainly for my fbl team and we got to start with the sacka situation from my perspective i was i was away all week in bulgaria thats why i didnt do the blackbox stream and so i was i had limited time to soak up information and team news and so on i caught some friday night got back that evening land looked at my team on saturday and i was going to roll my transfer u where i stood on saturday i was i was 80 certain that he would start because as we know hes had knocks in the past and the comments from carsle artetta were were positive lets face it so i thought he was i was certainly 8020 thinking he was going to start at bournemouth then i rolled the transfer but i almost wavered so 15 minutes before deadline i saw a tweet from what i thought was a reliable source charles watts which turned out to be boer if you dont know booner account on twitter who posts a troll post to misleading team news as a joke a joke it can be funny to be fair and this was one of his tweets and i fell for it so i put that tweet in the godfather tier chat to try and help people in there that this tweet was out there its public just in case you aint seen it 15 minutes ago sacas not playing i then went to my desk went to take sacker out put son in because it was it was looking like he was going to start he was he was back to fitness and it was a risk worth taking with the fixtures that spurs had and then i looked at whatsapp and there it was as was saying among others that was a boa post and it was fake so i didnt make the transfer cuz i was back to thinking 8020 sacka would start turns out that as saw my post thought it was weird as well made the transfer then realized too late it was a fake one i dont know crazy and then of course didnt turn up and i didnt get son and well talk about son and the assisted a bit but the rest his history of course sacker didnt turn up and then it turns out a load of content creators made last minute changes which im not surprised about im particularly not surprised about because then after the deadline i watched the arsenal fan tv video in which they one of the content creators on there if you can call them that said that sack was a major doubt and wouldnt play now had i seen that before deadline that for me would have made me 5050 no smoke without fire and then i would have made the transfer to song cuz 5050 would be enough for me but i didnt see it i didnt know that but what i can say is if i was among the content creators or other people who saw that in advance of deadline then i would have made that s transfer so i think its fair enough so all these people accusing content creators having secret information i think its pretty unfair because i can only go on what i know i didnt get any secret information and had i seen that arsenal fan tv id have been 5050 and id have made the transfer the song cuz logically it makes sense with this with the fixtures so i can only stand up for that view that it was all open and above board and a logical decision and of course youre going to make the decision late because youre going to wait till the final moment in case you do get a leak in case you do get public information thats going to sway you like sacker scene at the ground so its all understandable but i didnt benefit from it i didnt make the change because i thought he was going to start and i didnt see that arsenal fan tv clip which for me that would have been enough cuz it suggested that there was an itk out there who had information and it would have just tipped me 5050 and i would have made that transfer but anyway i hope i hope thats not a slid indoors moment for my season it has been a terrible game week i went into the arsenal bournemouth game with sacka with cba and with gabrielle celba got the red card sacka didnt turn up and arsenal lost the game 20 celba red card means hes out against liverpool which is a major blow to them in that game and it means that ill probably have to sell celba now with the two tree transfers ive got ahead of the next game week as for bournemouth you mean seeno was a stand out against six shots one chance created hes now had 37 shots 10 more than any other m fielder and in the end they won the game with a training ground set piece played ar at their own game a very good corner and a penalty its now four out clean sheet for arsenal and its liverpool newcastle and chelsea in the next three i think that i dont think im holding sacka its a hamstring injury could he could miss that game i think im going to be moving him out and its going to be ca going as well so with those fixtures and with a dip in form and confidence im definitely moving away from arsenal and then theres the son assist so the way i see it is the error here is on the tributing the own goal to arola because i think once you recognize that its an arola own goal rather than a tbo own goal you recognize that final touch that arola had and then that means that son shot has the initial save from arola ricochet back off to theo then the final touch from marola which was pivotal enough to be cited as a means to give him the own goal so thats three touches the rul say that for an assist to be awarded from an own goal the player awarded the assist has to directly force the own goal now i dont think in this case you can say that because by giving it to aras known goal were recognizing that his touch is a significant one presumably toos touch back towards goal wasnt on target and it was aras final touch that b it to b it to be a goal so therefore sunshot didnt directly lead to that go it was toos touch back the ricochet off too from the save the initial save mariola which was what forced the own goal the finals hch from marola therefore for me its no assist now had it been a tobo own goal id be more sympathetic i think it would be an assist then because for me the sun shop would force to save the ricochet off to debo and in but because theyve said arola a goal theyve recognize that third touch i dont think we can say son directly cost it therefore its no assist for me and there is presidents here if you go back to 2022 first game of the season man utd ball comes off the back of dow towards the bright and goal sanchez saves it onto mallister but mallister knocks the ball in for an own goal to mallister no assist was given to dow even though dows touch was sending the ball goldw and it was sanchez who saved it onto mall but no assist was given to dow he didnt benefit because presumably they felt that dows touch didnt force the own goal cuz mallister got the own goal and it was sanchezs save which forced the own goal but its the same here its tobos touch back the ricochet back to arola that forces the own goal therefore to be consistent with that incident in 2022 its no assist now whats crazy is it was no assist and then at 900 for some reason an assist was added and a tweet went out the tweet was later removed because there was a lot of negative reaction to it i stayed out of that but i just dont see it can be awarded assist if youre going to be consistent with what was gone before theres another incident the gapbo incident from last year against west ham arola own goal again ironically he had a shot that was off target but that doesnt matter the shot came off of ogbon onto such on the line and off of arola for an own goal arola own goal then as well nothing was given to gpo because his shot didnt directly forc the own goal from mariola if anything it was suchs touch on the line which forced the own goal so its the same again son shot didnt directly force the own goal because it was a touch back the ricochet off tobo that made arola score the own goal because it was credited to him now i dont think it should have been credited to him i think thats the mistake and in that case it would have been an assist in my book but arola and goal no assist for me as for the game itself son came out with a goal and assist came out with 047 xgi five shots two chances created a decent game you look good in spells but it was johnson who came out with a top xgi 93 overall five shots all in the box again looked to threet and its just that shot volume in the box that intrigues me hes had 26 shots this season all of them in the penalty area and in the end that volume thats got to offer value going forward madison has been a consideration but he won off at halim tactical decision by an to bring sa on and that was the trigger for the turnaround in the second half and spurs just blew west ham away so johnson continues to catch the eye i may go him over son of a bit more time this week if i if it is sacka who does make way ahead of liverpool game depending of whether sacka turns up for midweek european game of course the other player to talk about here sanky concerning just one shot one chance created had a look at the average position maps he was the deepest of all the spurs attacker so ahead so with madison kuresi johnson and son all four of them ahead of salanki in terms of the touches the average touches that they had on the pitch and you can see it with the it test he was coming deep he was linking play runners getting beyond him he wasnt getting the end of things that as i said one shot one chance thats not enough 012 xgi is a concern im already thinking that despite the fixtures i dont know if hes going to deliver the volume of points that i need from him and moveing havs after arsenals fixtures soften up a bit might be the way to go i think as for west ham i know two more players i want to is porro and a doggy went forward and pouring forward loads porro in particular scares me not having him he had for shots and two chances created on the day a doggy three chances created and got the assist but porro for me is the eye catcher 16 shots now the top amongst defenders this season that volume has got to pay off even without clean sheets i think hes a player that we need to keep on our adars and i think with the fixtures that spurs have got i may well be moving cba down to him depending on how the budget goes for me west ham now kudos got the goal well taken but then got the red card so hes out for three games and thats painful for west h because their fixtures are better now but theyre going to miss kudos who is is a big outlet for them bowen could have got the assist his cross to kudos did take a def flection and it did look as though it was intended for antonio i can see why it wasnt given harsh low for boeing owners those brave enough to go for the differential missing out on points again and we kidos out i just think that bo and ro remain a very lowly owned differential so everton won 2n at portman road a big fixture for it which they i found wanting i starting to fear for them i did have some good feelings about the liks of the lap and davis going into a better fixture run but 389 now is their xg for the season its the lowest in the division by quite a margin davis came out with three chances created and he does have 20 chances created for the season more than any other defender but i just see them scoring enough goals for him to convert that into assists dap has got four goals and he came out with a couple of shots in this game but i think it 018 his xg and davis was 023 just too low and everton had too much for him in midfield and they cope well of them at the back and in the end ran out at a caner for them calvin le was the stand out in terms of xgi 132 he had five shots in the game big frustration for calv l owners that he came out of a blank he had a couple of oneon ones which m did well with but cav l should have profited m neil got an assist now created 25 chances for the season second only to sacker amongst midfielders so he continues to offer value kean got the other goal he could be an option at the back but bran freight is near in fitness mikeno would be the better option he came back in to the side at left back did play deep didnt get forward too much but at 43 hes got to be worth a look now that everton fixes continued to be decent pford low backtoback clean sheets is e the answer for those who dont have ryar or for those who are giving up on ry after asked on conceding goals certainly its a good its a good couple of game weeks for pford and everton and suddenly theyre starting to look like they could be a source of value to us as well andai got the goal but it was some an error hes another one we could keep an eye on as a cheap forward option and again just going back to itwi they did make errors nine errors now for the season the most of any team its level with sampton and those defensive errors coupled with the fact they cant score goals could take them down half fought victory for villa at craen cottage rogers came in with his third goal in the season could have had more mr sitter before half time and came out with three shots 88 xgi which the pass watkins 41 he got his goal over and just two shots smartly taken header from matans corner and then v villa sealed it with an own goal as for fulham jenez was a standout again hes now returned in five successive games got the goal here four goals and one assist now in the last five for him could have had an assist as well if it wasnt for pereiras miss penalty because jnez forced the hand ball could be significant that because it was such a badly taken penalty from andes pereira that himz could step in now and take them to ad to his appeal even more 57 fulham have still got good fixtures he looks like hes going a new lease of life which is great to see a for fpl legend at walls born again at fulham definitely a consideration with the fixures that fulham have got and the confidence theyre playing with i dont think this defeat dilla will be a major setback are we finally going to get to look at some man united attackers maybe it was a good showing from the front three against brenford run out two one winners rashford gacho and hland all starting to click maybe or hinting at something hland came into the side and did impress he had three shots not 43 one chance created as well got his well taken goal from a lovely bruno assist only a second return of the season for bruno owners there gacha was a stand out load 10 shot creation involvements in the game week more than any other player thats eight shots and two chances created only 43 xgo it shows you that perhaps the quality of the chance wasnt great but theres potential here we know about garnacho hland needs games and needs consistency but maybe just first shoots of some progress that means we can start to consider united in the future theres five good fixes to come as well so who knows maybe not for me at the moment but one to monitor thats for sure as for brenford they capitalized on delit off the pitch to score from a corner that set piece thre is always there pinnick second goal of the season nothing too much more to talk about and bumo was kept quiet vandenberg started it right back again in the four and looks like it could be an option and visa was back on the bench got 30 minutes at the end good fixure still the next three it s fman bouth visa at 59 could it be al budget forward option i meant to say fleen got nine saves in that game now hes made more saves 42 than any other keeper hanson of leicester is second and he was involved in a ridiculous game at st mars where leicester run out 32 winners having been twonil down at halim great result for steve cooper side of course disaster for russell martins in this game its brian nut again who stood out five shots three chances created 145 xgi the highest in the game week he started out playing out on the on the right flank then when fatu came on everything changed for two did make an impact very lively in 31 minutes 51 xgi two shots and one chance created he had his pace frightened s anon and helped turn the game around bonan went to a central role number 10 got the first goal back and played a part those two played a part in the comeback and well its just tragic for sa anon theyve as i said made nine errors now six leading to goals the most in the division look suspect at set plays as well i think its 56 xg conceded at set plays the highest in the league and they got caught right at the end again rell martin seems to have a trouble on these corners he piles men into the box but leaves the edge of the box free and thats what lester did and they scored the equalizer assa the winner r iu to go three to up before that archer got his second in successive games and well could maybe another budget option if you would need to go down to 5m an intered manning 43 defender appeared to play left wing so they had dibling on one flank manning on the other so he was played out of position but mean while s hun look as brle as they do even on outter position defender playing up front is not going to tempt us is it super one nil win for brighton at newcastle wellber with his fifth goal of the season second now only a harland amongst forwards but did pick up a back injury so thats one to monitor if youre eying out well back for your forward lines a great a great victory for brighton they did it without matoma who started on the bench after international duty thats one to look for herzler looks to give players a rest after interal break so thats worth noting matoma came on though and hes still the standout player amongst that brighton team for me as for newcastle well they had plenty of chances they dominated the first half isach had nine shot involvements alog together seven shots two chances created for 088 xgi similarly golden four shots three chances created for 07 xgi those two we need to come into form again to give us those options but theyve typified newcastle this season just so erratic no consistency flat deceive and eak needs to find these shooting boots 83 it would be quite something if him and gordon could come alive again so thats all of saturdays games covered ive got four players today foden harland captain and lewis against wolves and then trent playing chelsea later i need some points ive only got 14 i think it is with seeno coming off the bench for sacka at the moment so it looks like a miserable game week and a red arrow for me but im not alone low scores everywhere its one of those game weeks i think you did well if you had broken 20 points from saturdays games as has of course but i dont want to talk about that then weve got forest palace on monday night so i might have to do that one from the shed to get this out in time so look out for that but thats all from me now and ill see you in the morning good morning so harem blanks for third successive game the first time hes ever done that in his man city career not only that he had very few touches no shots at all no chances created its only the third time in his career that hes had a game with zero shots when starting the last time was game we against arsenal last season so thats its a long time ago big regression hes had zero big chances in those three blanks where he had 10 big chances in the in the five games before that shows the aggression for those who wild carded him in and that includes me of course man city overall just struggled to break walls down i thought they lacked any penetration from out wide despite playing doku and savio greish and foden came off the bench to pep it up a little bit but they were they were devoid of ideas got the win of course foden got the assist from the corner from a from the stones header which was perhaps a bit fortuitous given the v check but overall city just huffed and puffed were a bit ploty a bit predictable and struggled but what do we do weve got to hold fodm weve got to hold harland we got to hold lewis weve got to hold gardio ahead of southampton in game week nine that is such a plum fixure the way that sa an are playing of course and varol got second goal of the season 28 touches in the box now i think hes just behind a doggy and lewis for that he continues to be a goal threat and that compensates for the lack of clean sheets that city get in but i dont know i think ive got to wait until deyne comes back to assess what i do with my man city assets i think foden if hes not going to be a reliable starter and sunday showed that i might have to think again on him and he might be the one to make way if im looking at palmer liverpool got the victory very difficult game against chelsea thought chelsea did very well but liverpool got the win in the end salah with the hall double figure return decimated our ranks that did only had the two shots two chances created 014 ex non penalty but of course got the penalty i think hes first of the season and then the assist for the curtis jones goal overall i think the major news elsewhere was diaz was benched perhaps expected after the international break thats something we got to look for that slot will do and it puts another question mark over him as a potential asset and then in the game j got injured after half an hour and got replaced by darwin so hes got an injury now so all of a sudden our options in that liverpool attack a cut back to maybe just s but we going there with palmer and harland and sacka on the list as well son of course so foden i havent but theres so many heavy hitters now demanding of our of those midfield slots and our money that sal has slipped off the ownership and thats why hes hold did so much damage to us elsewhere trent is a concern as well maybe hes someone whos going to give way as we look to pursue those heavy hitters no chances created in this game hes only created three chances over the last three games had four shots so no xgi from trent in this game and so you cant blame now people to waiver on him its arsenal next which is a difficult game are we going to get anything from trent then the fixtures do improve after that but given his price and his output at the moment you cant blame people for looking elsewhere as for chelsea parba was kept fairly quiet by curtis jones i thought he came out with four shots three in the box 56 xgi and he is top now for midfielders for xgi non penalty so hes still got to remain a target despite this being a difficult game for him as i said curtis jones did a good job on him in midfield and jackson came out of his fifth goal the season he 57 extra non penalty over the season now second only to harland amongst forwards there could be potential in this chelsea side beon palmer but hes got to remain the key target surely just ended at the city ground forest win one nil good performance and chris wood with the winner and lets lets talk about chriswood unbelievable hes now been involved in 62 of forest goals with on the pitch 7 8 shot accuracy 11 of his 16 shots been on target conversion rate of 31 its just incredible he continues to deliver why dont i have him in my team its it just seems crazy doesnt it a one nil win looks like sals is going to come out with a maximum bonus though i think he made six saves on the night including two worldies one from eay one from schook did well and a clean sheet again i think thats our third clean sheet cheat of the season happy with that result and from a forest point of view its wood and ss who the standouts minkovich and millo clean sheets again ana any of the back four look options but cs is beginning to look like potentially the four or five keeper to go for which you at one point i thought he wouldnt keep his place but hes put in performances out the bag now and all credit to him and then chris wood up front as you said elsewhere without gives white not a lot in midfield anderson played well won a lot of jewels but not a lot of nothing not fancy potential and e i think he had five shots again only one from inside the box hes had 32 shots now second only to cenia among midfielders but he just hes denied by a couple of sayes but again its just its just not working for palace is it nothing is going in for e and keto was poor in the first half mata apparently hes not fit although i dont know how they get ineta and mateta in the same team no theyre in trouble theyre too good to go down surely but theyre certainly in a fight now so a good final game forest good final game for me from a game week thats been terrible 26 points looks like im going down to 25m although there is going to be a change in points because the premier league today announced that theyre going to remove sons assist i think that will drop into one bonus as well so maybe thatll affect my rank as well good decision by the premier league and important that theyve gone back and corrected that if youve watched the video youve seen that i i did think that was a wrong decision and theyve come to that conclusion and corrected it and thats big for the game because it means that we can get decisions now that go wrong earlier corrected later in the game week right up until the end of end of the game week an hour after the game week on a monday night in this occasion so thats good for the future of the game good that theyve done that right decision i think for the reasons i said still think its a mistake me not getting son though i still think i made an eror there because i would have got some points instead of someo off the bench for only a couple and i think im going to end up looking at son for this game week because sacka doesnt look like he was in training today for the european tie against shaka so im gonna have to get rid of sacka and son could be on the menu so ive missed out on the points that he did get this week by doing that just a chain of events on saturday me not being about enough last week being too busy at work to soak up the team news and all the info on sacker as i said ive got to get better got to get better than 25m ill be back with blackbox with has later in the week if you enjoyed this video like and subscribe sorry there wasnt too much scenery in there with the weather it was difficult and i was pushed for time so hopefully when i do the next one the weathers better and i can get more of that in there like i say like and subscribe see you next time
