footballfix.com YouTube channel for another Elite 11 team reveal ahead of game week 11 guys we've got mark back on the channel we're going to preview game week 11 we've got Phil foden versus Bruno Fernandez comparison and we're going to take a look at all of the statistics as we approach game we 11 so without further Ado guys let's get right into it guys welcome back to the channel and Mark welcome back mate it's been a minute hasn't it so how have you been getting on how's the season been progressing mate hello Tom good to be back it's been a long time um I think the last time I was here I was doing quite a bit better than I am now uh I've had probably 75% red arrows recently oh ouch uh yeah you can see it on the graph there I was I started out quite well and held that up till about the wild card then like many people a disastrous wild card and then just uh kind of flat few weeks you know not really getting what we call a Rob of the green I guess and find it hard to make Headway but at the same time I haven't had a complete rank collapse and I think the gaps tight you know between a million 500,000 are pretty tight um as we'll see when we come to my team I was I was down at 1.7 million on on Saturday night and then just by virtue of salanki and Rogers doing quite well came back 700,000 wow so um while Saturday night might have been a time to panic for me I don't think it's time to panic now and I think for people in general um you know one outlier a really good week where you get in the top half million game week rank you can really uh make progress yeah nice thoughts mate yeah and I can I can see the the the Red Arrows there that you've mentioned but like you say it's still so tight isn't it for that for that range between half a million through a million so nothing no reason to panic um just yet you and I were talking off camera just before recording Mark as well around sort of decisions that people have made and then actually being eminently sensible and and the rub of the green do you think that's just a a reflection of this season being a little bit more difficult than in previous Seasons we've talked around the price points being good this season and people are making good decisions right it's just not not necessarily gone our way so far right yeah what I found in the last few weeks is like I've made some hard decisions um in terms of 50/50 calls were they really the right thing to do and you know looking back some of them might have been the wisest but I haven't really got busted in terms of points um my transfers I'm working out even are a little bit up in terms of points okay but my rank is just falling because of um just conditions and I don't think there's anything too exceptional about this um I think people you know trying retrofit of story the pricing is very competitive it's because we've got these great premiums but I don't think in a general sense there's anything that unusual going on here um you know when you have a good start maybe you get a little bit conservative and then you drop back because other people are being um more assertive and then every reaction is an opposite reaction so when I when I had um you know gone pretty low in rank on Saturday night you know that evening I was thinking what do I need to do here and I started thinking in a more aggressive fashion what moves would I make next week maybe I try and grab back some of the points I lost on Salah by continuing to avoid him so I went through this you know less than 24-hour period where I started to think differently and you know you realize there's other ways to get points and by virtue the fact that I started doing badly maybe I'm going to change what I do and maybe I'll get a boost out of that yeah I see so I don't think there's that too unusual going on this season um and beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so is good and bad luck you know so yeah I'm hoping it'll come back to me I'll probably due to where my rank is maybe I'll take a little bit more risk on things um maybe make a few transfers that are a little bit more risky but you know it's the game is always the same really you you live and die by the little bit of luck you get yeah you do yeah good good thoughts and it's interesting isn't it though the difference that one or two games can make on that second day of the of the of the game week I guess and you won't be alone in that with sanki as you mentioned and and Rogers of course so that's a nice little segue actually Mark let's take a very quick look and see how you performed in game week 10 okay so we can see here it's it's a team that we've already alluded to a couple of players that came through and saved the game week with Rogers and Tanki let's start with those two actually Mark I've got a couple of questions we are going to look ahead to your gameweek 11 team in just a just a few moments but what you read on ter on terms of Aston Villa here Rogers picking up a nice nine points here they've got this away match at Liverpool in gameweek 11 got beaten in the Champions League um as well and there's been sort of some noise around them looking a little bit jaded um off the back of the the tougher schedule do you think this is a time to start moving away from Aston Villa with Rogers being an exception what do you think about Aston Villa at large from in an FPL context um I don't think they've been very impressive all season to be honest um okay they've been like I don't know how to describe it a little bit stodgy I think they've lost a lot with Douglas Lise um Watkins got some points but nothing too spectacular and as you say you know you don't really move away from Rogers there's no good reason to at his value but um yeah they don't look too impressive like in my last man standing at work I was quite happy to back Spurs at the weekend and and watching that game um as funny I hear different people read this game differently but I felt it was very unjustified that Villa went in up at halftime okay um you know it was the usual Spurs story that we've seen a few times you know it started with Lester at the start of the season they had all the possession they had all the field tilt but they just weren't making the chances and then in the second half once they did maybe once Rogers went off uh Spurs made you know Spurs weren't afraid to change things a little bit and they started making chances and they won quite easily um you know it wasn't a 4-1 game but I think it was deserved at Spurs won and I wasn't too surprised um okay so there maybe I I think it's too simple to say like it's the Wednesday Saturday Wednesday no I think they lost um they lost some some important players maybe diabi was worth a little bit more to them than they thought Douglas Lise he was doing a lot in there yeah interesting the reason for asking the question is I know Ole Watkins will be in some of the viewers teams and and and certainly I'd I'd imagine that that would be a chance to be looking elsewhere and we've got some we'll do the stats round up later on guys and we'll look at attackers and we do we will be talking around Mo Salah of course in the in the earling Harland quandry as well let's take a look at the rest of the the team though Mark we've got this treble Man City compliment here with Rico Lewis Phil foden and and earling Harland there three losses on the spin on the Guardiola feels like that's the first time I could have said that whilst doing this videos what do you think about man city as an FPL option here let's let's take it in the three assets that you got right now should we be panicking is this just a blip what's going on with man city um it doesn't look good to be honest uh the Howland thing is I I think howland's fine to own um you know you talk about money and budget and all that and that's where the problem is with Howland but Howland as a player as a place in your team as someone who can perform week in week out it's not a problem yeah um and people would say he's not scoring but Dominic sanki wasn't score until Sunday um so that can turn around in a Flash so I'm happy enough to have Howland uh there's obviously things you can do with the money if if you don't have them but you know that's discussion then foron is he's been slightly painful to own um people who got on him would have got on him for a fixture run uh wolves then who was it Southampton and then bourett and I think his underlying stats have been reasonable uh you'd expect him to have more points so it's been quite painful and he scored in two European games around in this you know in this period of time of course he has um yeah so the issue I have with foding at the moment outside of City's form is people tend to now look at xgi a lot and they're going to think yeah he's doing quite well but the assist component of xgi for me Isn't it's not a fantastic metric in my opinion um because like there's a second degree and that's the other player has to convert the chance so I'm not I'm not entirely sure it's right to equate one xgi of G with one xgi of a if you know what I mean and that's mostly what fens is and that worries me about him and then Lewis is just about a sell for me I think yeah um I you know I think we all we believe the hype didn't we um and our worst fears kind of come to pass and they are a that Walker eats some of his minutes and that's happening and we thought it would and that's fine but then like the defensive fora city is they're wide open they're wide open down the right hand side yeah definitely yeah so he's he's I I think I bought him at 4.6 he's 4.8 now I can sell him for 4.7 when you look around you got people like Lewis Hall maybe Anderson a Fulham it's a bit it's a bit too much to have a player who's in a defense that's not doing anything um and as it's transpired he's not that great an attacking threat he might get these you know halfast sideways pass 30 yards out assists but he's not creating chances in the conventional sense yeah I see um so I'm I'm not too concerned about Howland I'm very concerned about Lewis and Fen just feels like you can do a little bit more with the money but he could explode any day yeah he could and like I say we do have a comparison between Phil foden and Bruno Fernandez uh to come later on in in our slides as well guys so stick around um for that I think that will probably wrap up my observations from your gameweek 10 uh Team Mark just a quick final thought on the you know the RICO Lewis money there one of the stats we're going to look at later on is of course expected goals conceded team metric and little spoiler Forest are actually top of that in terms of how well they're performing been amazing haven't they Mar they I think you called it that they ended the season last season impressively defensively that's continued into this season as well any thought that you could be looking to the Nottingham Forest defensive line to to complement your your defensive players yeah this one's a bit painful because like first of all to answer your question I think is a little bit late in the day okay and maybe we we can come back to it in a few weeks but I think they've got some fixtures now that indicate maybe they want keep as many clean sheets with the cavat yet that they kept clean sheet at anfield yes of course um and a few weeks ago I had I was making some moves and I got Pedro parro in and I kind of my gut was to go with minkovich and I didn't and I I'd say I haven't counted it up but there's a pretty big difference there at this point sorry sorry for asking mate yeah okay yeah yeah but you you know me Tom you get a sub story about every question there's always a sub story in the background that I'm only willing to tell that's why we have you on man we need to we need to offer you that that all right well let's see if we can continue that sub Story theme when we take a look at how your team is shaping up ahead of game week 11 and a transfer has already been made so let's take a look okay so it's kind of cool this week we're recording later in the week um we're recording midweek and a transfer has already been made we can see kuna already coming into the team here and I want to talk around that then um Mark they're sitting bottom of the league wolves they have had a wretched run of fixtures haven't they a really rotten start to the league in terms of the difficulty of fixtures we still believe though in this team and in in in coo ahead of finally a favorable run of fixtures how do you how do you assess them as a collective and then we talk around CO as an FPL option as well yeah yeah I mean this team this week isn't a SB story my team looks nice this week uh I'm absolutely getting the Green Arrow there's no doubt about that anuna um like he's half the story The the other half of the story is Dominic alveron and uh before this game week started one of the things I was considering last week was salanki to to uh COA so it's good I didn't do that because I wanted to do I would preferred to get Calbert Leen out and coo was my preferred option so I did that Saturday evening and I was going to do that once he came through um The Palace game fit so yeah half the story is um Calvert Leen then the reason I've gone for CA is yeah he's got good fixtures he's very good I think he's like a level above practically the majority of that uh wolves team I mean they've got some guys in the middle who are very good um who aren't you know so famous and they're not fantasy options but I think he's he he is legitimately their best player and Talisman um so I'm quite happy to take that for the next few fixtures um there were Alternatives there you know Chris Wood WIA R and I I just think this is the guy who can do the big Hall He's got hat-trick potential hasn't he Mark we've seen it previously as well he does have that monster Hall in his locker doesn't he that's you know a statement of fact we've actually seen those returns historically haven't we so yeah can can definitely definitely see see you there as well noticed here we've still got a free transfer Mark as well so presumably you had the two frees any plans to use the second one as part of this game you could you happy with how you're set up like you said you've got a guaranteed Green Arrow already so it's nice to know that but uh any other ways that you could invest that other transfer um I think look looking to the Future the the things I can imagine I'm going to need are I'm going to need to have a little bit more depth in my defense and as I mentioned Lewis is a bit of a waser and Greaves is a total waster um so I could use my I think I've got three no point4 as you've written there I could use that there um I could also roll yeah looking to the future but I'm not really in a mood to wait around and you know I need to I need to make moves in rank now um and the best way I think I can do that is to move Phil forward perhaps to Bruno Fernandez and we'll do that we'll take a look at stats in in a in a moment to see whether or not that's that is peing your interest um enough let's just talk quickly around the captaincy that I see the armband on Dominic salanki here Mark that's exciting talk to us around the virtues for Dom in the home game against lip Swit rather than earling Harland away at away at Brighton yeah I I like to switch my captaincy around at the start of the week to provide value for the the fantasy football fix Elite 11 reveal subscribers to give them something to think about so I'm thinking about you know you dear viewers um in this case I I think like there are a lot of options for people this week um if I have Bruno in there I'm very tempted I think K is not a bad pick I think salanki is not a bad pick and I think Howland is always a good pick yeah um I'll probably end up on I think just in the hope of um you know people got a jump on me last week who went to Salah and Captain them but they the main don't have Allen still so I hope to pull some of that back and I think he's you know he's got top expected points I expect um but I if I see any and Captain in sanki if I see anyone captaining uh Bruno Fernandez I think good for them you know I wouldn't say not to do it mate that's really that's really cool just a word on Cole Palmer as well we had it confirmed today that he hasn't yet trained we were recording on on Wednesday night there still Chelsea is still hopeful that he'll make the Arsenal fixture uh on the weekend let's just do a bit of a hypothetical Mark if he were to be ruled out of that game week any temptation to look elsewhere with with that premium option there or would you be holding him for for longer than than game week 11 no I think what I do is um I'd probably use the money I saved from foden on Bruno to maybe take Greaves or Lewis somewhere and play them instead I'd probably put in mikeno um I so I wouldn't sell bmer I took a hit to get him in a few weeks ago um as you know that was just I'm going to do this at some stage so I might as well do it um but on you know on the fact he hasn't trained on Tuesday if he got a kick on the knee bone on Sunday I wouldn't have he's not playing on Thursday I wouldn't have expected him to drink yesterday it didn't sound too serious does it and they're going to be absolutely reliant on him aren't they so yeah nothing to worry about there I'm sure all right cool well look guaranteed Green Arrow that's nice so um we'll see whether or not we can get you back on soon to see whether or not or just the extent of that green arrow Mark but yeah all looks good all right we've been talking around this Phil foden Bruno Fernandez comparison so let's take a look at what the fanasy footballfix.com statistics suggest in terms of that comparison okay Mark so Phil foden's coming to the team he's in my team as well I'm sure he's going to be in one or two of the guys watching um in terms of their teams as well we've got some stats up here for the season uh to date so far in terms of per 90 minute statistics you can see an awful lot of green on the right hand side here for Bruno Fernandez and we've got our attacking radar which is one of the features that you can go and take a look at on fantasy footballfix.com if you haven't already done so let's talk around this then Mark you're looking at Phil fod 9.3 million Bruno Fernandez over a million cheaper talk me through it mate I'm an owner I need to understand whether or not I need to ditch this Giza yeah so I I started out the week a little bit worried maybe about foden's minutes and that didn't get any better when he started yesterday uh but he scored and the nature of the goal he scored was you know the kind of goal that will endear him to Guardiola he he pressed he won the ball himself and he smashed in so I can imagine you know this is the kind of player that Guardiola wants in the team right now he seems to be one of the few players in that team who's performing to a somewhat reasonable level so I'm less concerned about his start but I'll still be worried at four o'clock on Saturday um and I think there's a good argument for holding him uh but the argument on the other side is that Bruno has three significantly easier fixtures um he's got penalties and he he again is a Talisman for United at the moment now the reason I ended up on foden is because I tried to take a play on fixtures that didn't work out so surely if I do this again justice justice will reign and Bruno will come in big time I'm not here to make any guar gu anes but yeah I guarantee it so um yeah that could be interesting I mean you're man united fan right Mark I mean they've got a new manager coming in that's look super exciting I'm really really looking forward to seeing how how he's going to adapt to the league and see what he can do with this crop of players obviously he's not in situ yet um they've looked terrible to me for so long are we expecting that they're going to rud rro is going to get a tune out of them prior to the new manager coming in yeah they have looked terrible you're right and they haven't scored many goals um I think they're 17th 18th maybe on XG across the season but they're sorry they're 18th on goal scored but they're sixth on XG okay um and I think when You' got Strikers like Highland and xery um you go a long way towards explaining why that is and you know what you're looking at with um Bruno is he's taking the set pieces he's taking penalties as we know he's taking corners and you're just against these bad defenses and you hope he can hit that 12 13 14 pointer once and maybe twice yeah I see um and I think looking at the fixtures it's a three fixture play and then he's gone maybe the sacka or something like that um so I think I'll do it I think I'll end up doing it and another thing there is it goes back to what I was mentioning about um uh you know Fen being a little bit more assisted yeah you can see here they're getting equal numbers of shots but it's not written there but the you know the the XG per shot it's implied by the other figures that maybe Bruno's getting a better quality of shot yeah his expected goals is markedly less isn't it and we're going to look at stats in a moment uh Mark in fact let's just move on and take a look at that cuz the uh one of the metrics that we look at there is attempted assists as well I think it is from a creativity perspective and I think that's going to make your point as well but I do understand the case that you're making for Bruno Fernandez and look it's a million isn't it give or take which is not an insignificant amount chunk of change to consider as to what that could do with your squad separately but let's take a look at the rest of rest of the stats Mark to see whether or not that completes the the picture here okay guys so you should be getting familiar with this set of or Suite of stats that we're looking at just a reminder this is the last four game we stats um per 90 minutes and players must have played at least 180 minutes to qualify and and if you look at the attempted assist Mark you can see foden's name is in their fourth I guess joint top in fact but is in that that set but you don't see him elsewhere in here right so is that making your point actually it creativity looks okay but actually the other Avenue to points you're not seeing his name up in lights and you need him to at that price yeah he feels like at the moment you're looking at maybe seven eight points at best um but like this is all very iffy stuff you know he you get one return in the first half there's no trouble getting a second return and then it's a hall so I think it's a very risky move to go from foron to um Bruno but the fixtures are significantly different there's like it's a big difference in those fixtures um you could look at Cities next three Brighton Spurs and Liverpool and like maybe you wouldn't be surprised if they have one win one draw one loss over those three sure and then what's what's the cap on what foden's going to get there whereas United optimistically playing two the promoted teams playing Everton who can be Resolute but they can be shocking as well you know you just hope maybe he gets two double figure halls there and it all pays itself off yeah no I like it it's really creative creative thought before we take your assessment on on some of these other players in in the in the stats there do you think you'll do it ahead of gameweek 11 do you think when we come to um game week 11 starting do you think Bruno Fernandez is going to be in your team I I I think so I'd be like 60 to 70% sure at this point I'll do it um just feel like I need to do something you know it would be very disappointing to sit on Fen he does nothing and then Bruno fires a few in whereas I think I would regret less taking the Gamble and it gone wrong than not taken it and gone wrong yeah and you know I think this is you've seen where my rank is so yeah no I have I have and despite what we said about how tight it is between to the half a million a million I get it at some point there needs to be a a decision made doesn't there of course man do play tomorrow night so hopefully this conversation isn't rendered completely redundant and Bruno Fernandez doesn't pick up any kind of knock or that rules him up I wouldn't mind though that would that would make mind up yeah um right so here are the other statistics then guys I always like talking about the expected goals conceded first this team metric that sort of highlights strong performing defenses we talked a little bit around um Forest already Mark any of the other ones leeping out of you I think you mentioned leis Hall didn't you earlier on in the um in the video as well do you think these teams are starting to make a case for defensive assets for folks watching to consider as part of their transfers moving forward I know Fulham have been in there for several game weeks already anyone else leaping out of you as as a potential team to Target from a defensive perspective I don't think anyone's standing out um from the point of view of they're defending so well that we should have them um Forest Forest yes but I think that as I said I think that time is slightly passed the names I mentioned were really more in terms of value of the players themselves maybe they're a good option because if there aren't many clean sheets going doesn't really matter too much who you pick I think people I'd be looking towards are those I mentioned yeah Hall maybe Anderson I think cantic could be a good pick um I'd be looking towards cwell maybe shortly okay nice and maybe just try and get on a few you um fix your swings and hope you get the value when you pick up a clean sheet or an attacking return along the way but I don't think you can say with the exception of Liverpool that any defense truly knows that it looks like what it's doing and and far but we mentioned yeah fair enough mate fair enough look earning harland's been a topic of discussion obviously in FPL circles for a little while now with how just how much money cost and lack of returns man City's form having lost three games on the spin examp for except still top of the XG he's top of the shots in the Box he's top of shots overall on this for this period mark which side of the fence are you coming down on in terms of retaining Highland or using that Highland money to access moala bearing in mind he still features in the expected FPL point stats that we can see there 7.7 over the last four what's your read mate um like if you look back at what he's done certainly against Southampton and B tournament and people say he's missed big chances and he has but like I think anyone who's played football even fide knows that feeling when the ball comes across to you and you just can't twist to get it in or you just can't get the header at the angle I think that's what it looks like it doesn't look like he's missing you know one-on ones where he's just had a melt down and he couldn't make a decision it's like he's trying to physically get it in but just you can and I think we all know that feeling and he's just had a series of those that could as easily have gone in as not so I'm not too worried about it and you know in light of what sanki did on Sunday we shouldn't be too worried about it the concern is you know you're there's the opportunity cost and then on the Salah side and I realize I am probably the only person in the world who hasn't been impressed by Salah this season and you know don't even bother putting it in the comments I know I'm wrong but I I watched the games and he's not too involved or you know he's not I don't think he's doing the things he did before in terms of just torching Defenders and things like that but then he just has this amazing moment of quality with an assist or the goal on Saturday and just I I feel he's getting the other side of what howand isn't okay Interesting Man interesting and you know that's a risky game to play yeah and I think one of the flaws that FPL players traditionally have is they flipflop and that's why I think captaining Holland again this week is probably the best play you captained them you captained them then you flip-flop for no good reason and you miss the hall and you're like oh look how unlucky I am but it's just no you just you're making inconsistent decisions here yeah if if he's your captain he's your captain I like it well I've just thought of something we didn't talk around this off camera but um at all in fact it's a complete ball for you but previously we were talking around foden to Bruno Fernandez there gar NATO's name appears here a couple of times in terms of the shot volume markedly cheaper um any temptation to completely restructure things and and go down to Gara or are you thinking actually you need the assurity of minutes and the penalties for that to be a viable move and garnacho isn't a viable option yeah I think one of the big things that's in Bruno's favor is we believe he's a lock for a start in 90 minutes and there's one instance at the towards the end of the Chelsea game where garnacha was really careless and he got number one bailed out and then ball out by casimero and I don't know it's the kind of thing you see and you think well a manager might give him a a boot up the ass and put him on the bench the next game see and I just I don't know because we've seen um seen rashford on both sides seen him on the right against Chelsea which is kind of rare enough under 10 hag I just feel like um maybe things are pretty fluid between Dio rashford and garnacho and just I I don't think he's sure enough of his start it could be wrong but no it's Bruno all day for me fair enough mate fair enough in terms of these other players here we've obviously got Cole Palmer that we've talked around as well Dam sc's name's been up in lights for the last two videos that I've looked at here and and Alexander isach as well starting to appear in these charts as well we've not mentioned him throughout the course of the video but scored a great goal what a cool goal that was against Arsenal what a throwback to actually being able to cross the ball and header it I loved it as someone who grew up watching football in the 90s um do do you think there's anything in in eak as an FPL option Mark right now as part of a front three or do you think he's he's slightly too much money what do you think about Newcastle attacking assets with specifically around isach um yeah I think the time for we went through a little spell there where everyone's talking about a pool of Strikers k um CA WI a ro these I think the focus now around 12 is going to shift to um maybe ISAC Jackson back to HS and people are going to be a little bit antsy that they don't have that extra little bit of money um in the bank so they really present a nice alternative to Howland that I wasn't convinced that replacing Howland with one of these lower budget players was great but I think when you've got an option in 12 like Jackson um or ISAC it's really very attractive to then go to Salah elsewhere see um I you know I think and salanki has saved himself quite a bit of selling as well so you know I think we can see forward lines pretty soon who are Jackson sanki isak type things yeah love it love having all these great options and many different types of teams that are going to be being seen all over all over the the game like I I personally really enjoy that yeah I I think what people should not forget is that yes alland and Salah will score the Halls more often but other players will get Halls less often and it's not you know there's there's a lot of ways to go there's a lot of options you can take and if you're a person who spends a lot of time complaining about template moves and people copying um content creators or whatever you can definitely be brave and find your own way here and you'll do well if if you're lucky yeah exactly and and and hopefully some of the viewers get that because it's a great feeling when it does when it does land definitely Mark been a pleasure mate great to catch up we've just gone over a half hour so we should probably wrap things up but is there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to wanted to mention before we call it quits no I I don't I don't think so I think this is a good week for maybe taking a hit or two there's some pretty tasty fixtures on so if you need to make a longterm fix to your team might be a good week to try it like it good way to finish mate well enjoy the guaranteed Green Arrow and thanks so much for coming back on the channel I look forward to seeing that trending upward graph next time we speak guys if you have enjoyed the video do please consider

the channel and mark welcome back mate its been a minute hasnt it so how have you been getting on hows the season been progressing mate hello tom good to be back its been a long time i think the last time i was here i was doing quite a bit better than i am now ive had probably 75 red arrows recently ouch you can see it on the graph there i was i started out quite well and held that up till about the wild card then like many people a disastrous wild card and then just flat few weeks not getting what we call a rob of the green and find it hard to make headway but at the same time i havent had a complete rank collapse and i think the gaps tight between a million 500000 are pretty tight as well see when we come to my team i was i was down at 17m on saturday night and then just by virtue of salanki and rogers doing quite well came back 700000 wow so while saturday night might have been a time to panic for me i dont think its time to panic now and i think for people in general one outlier a good week where you get in the top half million game week rank you can make progress nice thoughts mate and i can i can see the red arrows there that youve mentioned but like you say its still so tight isnt it for that for that range between half a million through a million so nothing no reason to panic just yet you and i were talking off camera just before recording mark as well around decisions that people have made and then being eminently sensible and the rub of the green do you think thats just a reflection of this season being a little bit more difficult than in previous seasons weve talked around the price points being good this season and people are making good decisions right its just not necessarily gone our way so far right what i found in the last few weeks is like ive made some hard decisions in terms of 5050 calls were they the right thing to do and looking back some of them might have been the wisest but i havent got busted in terms of points my transfers im working out even are a little bit up in terms of points okay but my rank is just falling because of just conditions and i dont think theres anything too exceptional about this i think people trying retrofit of story the pricing is very competitive its because weve got these great premiums but i dont think in a general sense theres anything that unusual going on here when you have a good start maybe you get a little bit conservative and then you drop back because other people are being more assertive and then every reaction is an opposite reaction so when i when i had gone pretty low in rank on saturday night that evening i was thinking what do i need to do here and i started thinking in a more aggressive fashion what moves would i make next week maybe i try and grab back some of the points i lost on salah by continuing to avoid him so i went through this less than 24hour period where i started to think differently and you realize theres other ways to get points and by virtue the fact that i started doing badly maybe im going to change what i do and maybe ill get a boost out of that i see so i dont think theres that too unusual going on this season and beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so is good and bad luck so im hoping itll come back to me ill probably due to where my rank is maybe ill take a little bit more risk on things maybe make a few transfers that are a little bit more risky its the game is always the same you live and die by the little bit of luck you get you do good thoughts and its interesting isnt it though the difference that one or two games can make on that second day of the of the of the game week and you wont be alone in that with sanki as you mentioned and rogers of course so thats a nice little segue mark lets take a very quick look and see how you performed in game week 10 okay so we can see here its its a team that weve already alluded to a couple of players that came through and saved the game week with rogers and tanki lets start with those two mark ive got a couple of questions we are going to look ahead to your gw 11 team in just a just a few moments but what you read on ter on terms of aston villa here rogers picking up a nice nine points here theyve got this away match at liverpool in gw 11 got beaten in the champions league as well and theres been some noise around them looking a little bit jaded off the back of the tougher schedule do you think this is a time to start moving away from aston villa with rogers being an exception what do you think about aston villa at large from in an fpl context i dont think theyve been very impressive all season to be honest okay theyve been like i dont know how to describe it a little bit stodgy i think theyve lost a lot with douglas lise watkins got some points but nothing too spectacular and as you say you dont move away from rogers theres no good reason to at his value but they dont look too impressive like in my last man standing at work i was quite happy to back spurs at the weekend and watching that game as funny i hear different people read this game differently but i felt it was very unjustified that villa went in up at halftime okay it was the usual spurs story that weve seen a few times it started with lester at the start of the season they had all the possession they had all the field tilt but they just werent making the chances and then in the second half once they did maybe once rogers went off spurs made spurs werent afraid to change things a little bit and they started making chances and they won quite easily it wasnt a 41 game but i think it was deserved at spurs won and i wasnt too surprised okay so there maybe i think its too simple to say like its the wednesday saturday wednesday no i think they lost they lost some important players maybe diabi was worth a little bit more to them than they thought douglas lise he was doing a lot in there interesting the reason for asking the question is i know ole watkins will be in some of the viewers teams and certainly id id imagine that would be a chance to be looking elsewhere and weve got some well do the stats round up later on guys and well look at attackers and we do we will be talking around mo salah of course in the in the earling harland quandry as well lets take a look at the rest of the team though mark weve got this treble man city compliment here with rico lewis phil foden and earling harland there three losses on the spin on the guardiola feels like thats the first time i could have said that whilst doing this videos what do you think about man city as an fpl option here lets lets take it in the three assets that you got right now should we be panicking is this just a blip whats going on with man city it doesnt look good to be honest the howland thing is i think howlands fine to own you talk about money and budget and all that and thats where the problem is with howland but howland as a player as a place in your team as someone who can perform week in week out its not a problem and people would say hes not scoring but dominic sanki wasnt score until sunday so that can turn around in a flash so im happy enough to have howland theres things you can do with the money if you dont have them thats discussion then foron is hes been slightly painful to own people who got on him would have got on him for a fixture run wolves then who was it southampton and then bourett and i think his underlying stats have been reasonable youd expect him to have more points so its been quite painful and he scored in two european games around in this in this period of time of course he has so the issue i have with foding at the moment outside of citys form is people tend to now look at xgi a lot and theyre going to think hes doing quite well but the assist component of xgi for me isnt its not a fantastic metric in my opinion because like theres a second degree and thats the other player has to convert the chance so im not im not entirely sure its right to equate one xgi of g with one xgi of a if what and thats mostly what fens is and that worries me about him and then lewis is just about a sell for me i think i i think we all we believe the hype didnt we and our worst fears come to pass and they are a that walker eats some of his minutes and thats happening and we thought it would and thats fine but then like the defensive fora city is theyre wide open theyre wide open down the right hand side definitely so hes hes i think i bought him at 46 hes 48 now i can sell him for 47 when you look around you got people like lewis hall maybe anderson a fulham its a bit its a bit too much to have a player whos in a defense thats not doing anything and as its transpired hes not that great an attacking threat he might get these halfast sideways pass 30 yards out assists but hes not creating chances in the conventional sense i see so im im not too concerned about howland im very concerned about lewis and fen just feels like you can do a little bit more with the money but he could explode any day he could and like i say we do have a comparison between phil foden and bruno fernandez to come later on in our slides as well guys so stick around for that i think that will probably wrap up my observations from your gw 10 team mark just a quick final thought on the the rico lewis money there one of the stats were going to look at later on is of course expected goals conceded team metric and little spoiler forest are top of that in terms of how well theyre performing been amazing havent they mar they i think you called it that they ended the season last season impressively defensively thats continued into this season as well any thought that you could be looking to the nottingham forest defensive line to complement your defensive players this ones a bit painful because like first of all to answer your question i think is a little bit late in the day okay and maybe we can come back to it in a few weeks but i think theyve got some fixtures now that indicate maybe they want keep as many clean sheets with the cavat yet that they kept clean sheet at anfield yes of course and a few weeks ago i had i was making some moves and i got pedro parro in and i my gut was to go with minkovich and i didnt and id say i havent counted it up but theres a pretty big difference there at this point sorry for asking mate okay but you me tom you get a sub story about every question theres always a sub story in the background that im only willing to tell thats why we have you on man we need to we need to offer you that all right well lets see if we can continue that sub story theme when we take a look at how your team is shaping up ahead of game week 11 and a transfer has already been made so lets take a look okay so its cool this week were recording later in the week were recording midweek and a transfer has already been made we can see kuna already coming into the team here and i want to talk around that then mark theyre sitting bottom of the league wolves they have had a wretched run of fixtures havent they a rotten start to the league in terms of the difficulty of fixtures we still believe though in this team and in coo ahead of finally a favorable run of fixtures how do you how do you assess them as a collective and then we talk around co as an fpl option as well this team this week isnt a sb story my team looks nice this week im absolutely getting the green arrow theres no doubt about that anuna like hes half the story the other half of the story is dominic alveron and before this game week started one of the things i was considering last week was salanki to coa so its good i didnt do that because i wanted to do i would preferred to get calbert leen out and coo was my preferred option so i did that saturday evening and i was going to do that once he came through the palace game fit so half the story is calvert leen then the reason ive gone for ca is hes got good fixtures hes very good i think hes like a level above practically the majority of that wolves team theyve got some guys in the middle who are very good who arent so famous and theyre not fantasy options but i think hes he is legitimately their best player and talisman so im quite happy to take that for the next few fixtures there were alternatives there chris wood wia r and i just think this is the guy who can do the big hall hes got hattrick potential hasnt he mark weve seen it previously as well he does have that monster hall in his locker doesnt he thats a statement of fact weve seen those returns historically havent we so can definitely see you there as well noticed here weve still got a free transfer mark as well so presumably you had the two frees any plans to use the second one as part of this game you could you happy with how youre set up like you said youve got a guaranteed green arrow already so its nice to know that but any other ways that you could invest that other transfer i think look looking to the future the things i can imagine im going to need are im going to need to have a little bit more depth in my defense and as i mentioned lewis is a bit of a waser and greaves is a total waster so i could use my i think ive got three no point4 as youve written there i could use that there i could also roll looking to the future but im not in a mood to wait around and i need to i need to make moves in rank now and the best way i think i can do that is to move phil forward perhaps to bruno fernandez and well do that well take a look at stats in a in a moment to see whether or not thats that is peing your interest enough lets just talk quickly around the captaincy that i see the armband on dominic salanki here mark thats exciting talk to us around the virtues for dom in the home game against lip swit rather than earling harland away at away at brighton i like to switch my captaincy around at the start of the week to provide value for the fantasy football fix elite 11 reveal subscribers to give them something to think about so im thinking about you dear viewers in this case i think like there are a lot of options for people this week if i have bruno in there im very tempted i think k is not a bad pick i think salanki is not a bad pick and i think howland is always a good pick ill probably end up on i think just in the hope of people got a jump on me last week who went to salah and captain them but they the main dont have allen still so i hope to pull some of that back and i think hes hes got top expected points i expect but i if i see any and captain in sanki if i see anyone captaining bruno fernandez i think good for them i wouldnt say not to do it mate thats thats cool just a word on cole palmer as well we had it confirmed today that he hasnt yet trained we were recording on wednesday night there still chelsea is still hopeful that hell make the arsenal fixture on the weekend lets just do a bit of a hypothetical mark if he were to be ruled out of that game week any temptation to look elsewhere with that premium option there or would you be holding him for longer than game week 11 no i think what i do is id probably use the money i saved from foden on bruno to maybe take greaves or lewis somewhere and play them instead id probably put in mikeno i so i wouldnt sell bmer i took a hit to get him in a few weeks ago as that was just im going to do this at some stage so i might as well do it but on on the fact he hasnt trained on tuesday if he got a kick on the knee bone on sunday i wouldnt have hes not playing on thursday i wouldnt have expected him to drink yesterday it didnt sound too serious does it and theyre going to be absolutely reliant on him arent they so nothing to worry about there im sure all right cool well look guaranteed green arrow thats nice so well see whether or not we can get you back on soon to see whether or not or just the extent of that green arrow mark but all looks good all right weve been talking around this phil foden bruno fernandez comparison so lets take a look at what the fanasy footballfixcom statistics suggest in terms of that comparison okay mark so phil fodens coming to the team hes in my team as well im sure hes going to be in one or two of the guys watching in terms of their teams as well weve got some stats up here for the season to date so far in terms of per 90 minute statistics you can see an awful lot of green on the right hand side here for bruno fernandez and weve got our attacking radar which is one of the features that you can go and take a look at on fantasy footballfixcom if you havent already done so lets talk around this then mark youre looking at phil fod 93m bruno fernandez over a million cheaper talk me through it mate im an owner i need to understand whether or not i need to ditch this giza so i started out the week a little bit worried maybe about fodens minutes and that didnt get any better when he started yesterday but he scored and the nature of the goal he scored was the goal that will endear him to guardiola he pressed he won the ball himself and he smashed in so i can imagine this is the player that guardiola wants in the team right now he seems to be one of the few players in that team whos performing to a somewhat reasonable level so im less concerned about his start but ill still be worried at four oclock on saturday and i think theres a good argument for holding him but the argument on the other side is that bruno has three significantly easier fixtures hes got penalties and he again is a talisman for united at the moment now the reason i ended up on foden is because i tried to take a play on fixtures that didnt work out so surely if i do this again justice will reign and bruno will come in big time im not here to make any guar gu anes but i guarantee it so that could be interesting youre man united fan right mark theyve got a new manager coming in thats look super exciting im looking forward to seeing how hes going to adapt to the league and see what he can do with this crop of players hes not in situ yet theyve looked terrible to me for so long are we expecting that theyre going to rud rro is going to get a tune out of them prior to the new manager coming in they have looked terrible youre right and they havent scored many goals i think theyre 17th 18th maybe on xg across the season but theyre sorry theyre 18th on goal scored but theyre sixth on xg okay and i think when you got strikers like highland and xery you go a long way towards explaining why that is and what youre looking at with bruno is hes taking the set pieces hes taking penalties as we know hes taking corners and youre just against these bad defenses and you hope he can hit that 12 13 14 pointer once and maybe twice i see and i think looking at the fixtures its a three fixture play and then hes gone maybe the sacka like that so i think ill do it i think ill end up doing it and another thing there is it goes back to what i was mentioning about fen being a little bit more assisted you can see here theyre getting equal numbers of shots but its not written there but the the xg per shot its implied by the other figures that maybe brunos getting a better quality of shot his expected goals is markedly less isnt it and were going to look at stats in a moment mark in fact lets just move on and take a look at that cuz the one of the metrics that we look at there is attempted assists as well i think it is from a creativity perspective and i think thats going to make your point as well but i do understand the case that youre making for bruno fernandez and look its a million isnt it give or take which is not an insignificant amount chunk of change to consider as to what that could do with your squad separately but lets take a look at the rest of rest of the stats mark to see whether or not that completes the picture here okay guys so you should be getting familiar with this set of or suite of stats that were looking at just a reminder this is the last four game we stats per 90 minutes and players must have played at least 180 minutes to qualify and if you look at the attempted assist mark you can see fodens name is in their fourth joint top in fact but is in that set but you dont see him elsewhere in here right so is that making your point it creativity looks okay but the other avenue to points youre not seeing his name up in lights and you need him to at that price he feels like at the moment youre looking at maybe seven eight points at best but like this is all very iffy stuff he you get one return in the first half theres no trouble getting a second return and then its a hall so i think its a very risky move to go from foron to bruno but the fixtures are significantly different theres like its a big difference in those fixtures you could look at cities next three brighton spurs and liverpool and like maybe you wouldnt be surprised if they have one win one draw one loss over those three sure and then whats whats the cap on what fodens going to get there whereas united optimistically playing two the promoted teams playing everton who can be resolute but they can be shocking as well you just hope maybe he gets two double figure halls there and it all pays itself off no i like its creative thought before we take your assessment on some of these other players in the in the stats there do you think youll do it ahead of gw 11 do you think when we come to game week 11 starting do you think bruno fernandez is going to be in your team i think so id be like 60 to 70 sure at this point ill do it just feel like i need to do something it would be very disappointing to sit on fen he does nothing and then bruno fires a few in whereas i think i would regret less taking the gamble and it gone wrong than not taken it and gone wrong and i think this is youve seen where my rank is so no i have i have and despite what we said about how tight it is between to the half a million a million i get it at some point there needs to be a decision made doesnt there of course man do play tomorrow night so hopefully this conversation isnt rendered completely redundant and bruno fernandez doesnt pick up any knock or that rules him up i wouldnt mind though that would that would make mind up right so here are the other statistics then guys i always like talking about the expected goals conceded first this team metric that highlights strong performing defenses we talked a little bit around forest already mark any of the other ones leeping out of you i think you mentioned leis hall didnt you earlier on in the in the video as well do you think these teams are starting to make a case for defensive assets for folks watching to consider as part of their transfers moving forward i know fulham have been in there for several game weeks already anyone else leaping out of you as a potential team to target from a defensive perspective i dont think anyones standing out from the point of view of theyre defending so well that we should have them forest yes but i think that as i said i think that time is slightly passed the names i mentioned were more in terms of value of the players themselves maybe theyre a good option because if there arent many clean sheets going doesnt matter too much who you pick i think people id be looking towards are those i mentioned hall maybe anderson i think cantic could be a good pick id be looking towards cwell maybe shortly okay nice and maybe just try and get on a few you fix your swings and hope you get the value when you pick up a clean sheet or an attacking return along the way but i dont think you can say with the exception of liverpool that any defense truly knows that it looks like what its doing and far but we mentioned fair enough mate fair enough look earning harlands been a topic of discussion in fpl circles for a little while now with how just how much money cost and lack of returns man citys form having lost three games on the spin examp for except still top of the xg hes top of the shots in the box hes top of shots overall on this for this period mark which side of the fence are you coming down on in terms of retaining highland or using that highland money to access moala bearing in mind he still features in the expected fpl point stats that we can see there 77 over the last four whats your read mate like if you look back at what hes done certainly against southampton and b tournament and people say hes missed big chances and he has but like i think anyone whos played football even fide knows that feeling when the ball comes across to you and you just cant twist to get it in or you just cant get the header at the angle i think thats what it looks like it doesnt look like hes missing oneon ones where hes just had a melt down and he couldnt make a decision its like hes trying to physically get it in but just you can and i think we all know that feeling and hes just had a series of those that could as easily have gone in as not so im not too worried about it and in light of what sanki did on sunday we shouldnt be too worried about it the concern is youre theres the opportunity cost and then on the salah side and i realize i am probably the only person in the world who hasnt been impressed by salah this season and dont even bother putting it in the comments i know im wrong but i watched the games and hes not too involved or hes not i dont think hes doing the things he did before in terms of just torching defenders and things like that but then he just has this amazing moment of quality with an assist or the goal on saturday and just i feel hes getting the other side of what howand isnt okay interesting man interesting and thats a risky game to play and i think one of the flaws that fpl players traditionally have is they flipflop and thats why i think captaining holland again this week is probably the best play you captained them you captained them then you flipflop for no good reason and you miss the hall and youre like look how unlucky i am but its just no you just youre making inconsistent decisions here if hes your captain hes your captain i like it well ive just thought of something we didnt talk around this off camera but at all in fact its a complete ball for you but previously we were talking around foden to bruno fernandez there gar natos name appears here a couple of times in terms of the shot volume markedly cheaper any temptation to completely restructure things and go down to gara or are you thinking you need the assurity of minutes and the penalties for that to be a viable move and garnacho isnt a viable option i think one of the big things thats in brunos favor is we believe hes a lock for a start in 90 minutes and theres one instance at the towards the end of the chelsea game where garnacha was careless and he got number one bailed out and then ball out by casimero and i dont know its the thing you see and you think well a manager might give him a boot up the ass and put him on the bench the next game see and i just i dont know because weve seen seen rashford on both sides seen him on the right against chelsea which is rare enough under 10 hag i just feel like maybe things are pretty fluid between dio rashford and garnacho and just i dont think hes sure enough of his start it could be wrong but no its bruno all day for me fair enough mate fair enough in terms of these other players here weve got cole palmer that weve talked around as well dam scs names been up in lights for the last two videos that ive looked at here and alexander isach as well starting to appear in these charts as well weve not mentioned him throughout the course of the video but scored a great goal what a cool goal that was against arsenal what a throwback to being able to cross the ball and header it i loved it as someone who grew up watching football in the 90s do you think theres anything in eak as an fpl option mark right now as part of a front three or do you think hes hes slightly too much money what do you think about newcastle attacking assets with specifically around isach i think the time for we went through a little spell there where everyones talking about a pool of strikers k ca wi a ro these i think the focus now around 12 is going to shift to maybe isac jackson back to hs and people are going to be a little bit antsy that they dont have that extra little bit of money in the bank so they present a nice alternative to howland that i wasnt convinced that replacing howland with one of these lower budget players was great but i think when youve got an option in 12 like jackson or isac its very attractive to then go to salah elsewhere see i i think and salanki has saved himself quite a bit of selling as well so i think we can see forward lines pretty soon who are jackson sanki isak type things love it love having all these great options and many different types of teams that are going to be being seen all over all over the game like i personally enjoy that i think what people should not forget is that yes alland and salah will score the halls more often but other players will get halls less often and its not theres theres a lot of ways to go theres a lot of options you can take and if youre a person who spends a lot of time complaining about template moves and people copying content creators or whatever you can definitely be brave and find your own way here and youll do well if youre lucky exactly and hopefully some of the viewers get that because its a great feeling when it does when it does land definitely mark been a pleasure mate great to catch up weve just gone over a half hour so we should probably wrap things up but is there anything that we havent covered that you wanted to wanted to mention before we call it quits no i dont i dont think so i think this is a good week for maybe taking a hit or two theres some pretty tasty fixtures on so if you need to make a longterm fix to your team might be a good week to try it like it good way to finish mate well enjoy the guaranteed green arrow and thanks so much for coming back

1,fantasyfootballfixYT,Pj0JMM1ODcI,"😬 SELL HAALAND, BUY ISAK? | TOP Fantasy Premier League transfers 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 11 Guide",2024-11-06T11:00:24Z,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix YouTube video my name is f naturo and in today's video we are taking a look at those top transfers going into gameweek 11 we're going to prioritize those premium forwards and some of those budget midfielders so as always if you look forward today's video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further Ado let's get into today's [Music] video so first up as I mentioned I really want to touch on these premium forwards because I think a lot of the conversation over the last few weeks has all been about the budget forwards Chris Wood kuna Visa just to name a few but I really do think we might be getting into the sort of time of year where the premium forwards really do stand out as the best value picks in the game in that forward Department been a lot of talk about selling erling hland currently the most sold player and I do think there is justification maybe to come down from him not all the way to the budget forwards but this bracket forward we're going to take a look at these four here Dominic salanki of course off the back at that 16-point Hall in gameweek 10 congratulations to anybody that actually did keep hold of him Nicholas Jackson little bit disappointing in game week 10 but still putting up great numbers Alexander isak a little bit of a Rejuvenation we're seeing the best of him over the last three games and of course Ole Watkins Mr consistent so the big question is first and foremost who is the best one and then secondly should we actually be spending the money to come up from our cheaper forwards or downgrade from earling hland so first up we have to talk about Dominic sanki everybody who kept hold of him were rewarded in gameweek 10 and I still think there are going to be rewards in game week 11 at home against IP switch it's worth noting when we look at the actual underlying numbers over the course of the season so the opening 10 game weeks they've actually been really good I know a lot of people have been worried about him over the past two or three game weeks but again there are so many factors that we need to take into consideration if you're just analyzing the last few games and San's numbers at 0.63 per 90 have always been solid and what's really interesting to me is a lot of people are saying that Dominick sanki has been dropping deep being much more of a Harry Kane character linking up the play being creative well at .06 expected assists that's not necessarily paintting the whole picture so I still think he is a brilliant goal threat in this Spurs team big chances at 1.27 as well is third second best on this list but still good regardless the big problem with salanki of course is that IP switch at home is brilliant but then Man City away is that a tough fixture right now you could be the judge of that then Fulham at home and Bournemouth away now in terms of Nicholas Jackson I would argue in terms of longevity in terms of fixures this is probably the pick yes Arsenal at home is not the entry point for many many people but then Leicester away Villa at home and then Southampton away is a really good set of fixtures and they actually continue beyond that until the new year Nicholas Jackson's numbers very similar to that of sankis in terms of XG per 90 expected assists slightly higher and basically the same in terms of big chances so Nicholas Jackson is basically the same as Dominic sanki but I would argue that Jackson probably has slightly more rotation risk in the sense of Christopher and kungu now Jackson will start pretty much every game as long as he is fit but there is definitely the risk of rotation during this busy Christmas period but I still think Nicholas Jackson long-term is a fantastic pick for our teams and he does a bit of both contributes in terms of the goals and in terms of the creativity in this Chelsey team now finally the last two before we come to some sort of conclusion Alexander isach only just coming on radar he was the talker the time during preseason picked up the injury little bit of a slow start we're finally seeing the best of him now .45 expected goals per 90 over these last 10 game weeks but we are as I mentioned only seeing the best of him now 0.8 big chances per 90 is a slight concern and I would expect in some of these better fixtures for that to improve but the big thing is are the fixtures worth investing in Forest have proved to be a tough cookie recently so I don't think that is a great entry point West Ham at home is great in gameweek 12 then Palace away leaking goals then Liverpool at home so I think similar to Nicholas Jackson you don't really look to invest in this sa this week it very much is the case of next week finally OE Watkins now now at 9 million we really have to be confident and invest in an ollie Watkins to pay the premium especially when we got people like salanki at 1.4 million cheaper now the underlying numbers are great 0.75 expected goals per 90 he always is going to be the one that has the best numbers because we have seen it now over the last 18 months that this guy is consistently the man in this astonvilla team 1.5 big chances per 90 as well yes there is that hindrance in terms of John ran I do think he will steal minutes off him whether it be a start in one of maybe the next six games because we need to remember Villa trying to manage champions league and premier league and a busy period I think there could be some rotation in OE Watkins in either the brenford game or the following Southampton game in gameweek 14 I believe so we need to keep an eye on that because John Duran is definitely knocking on the door but one thing we need to remember is that John Duran is actually taking minutes away from other assets in the team like a Morgan Rogers so I don't think Watkins is just a direct rotation risk but his minutes are definitely a problem longer term in terms of those 90 minutes so to conclude we need to remember that gameweek 12 is probably the entry point for a lot of these forwards very much the case of Jackson isach and Ole Watkins if you own Dominic sanki I would absolutely keep and reassess after the international break if you have the funds available to go to Someone Like A Nicholas Jackson I do like it I think the Chelsea team are good offensively I think Nicholas Jack's minutes are great and I don't see much rotation risk long-term for him as I would see with someone like a Ole Watkins Alexander isach is probably the punt but 8.3 million with Callum Wilson returning from injury very soon I will be a little bit concerned about isak's minutes over the Christmas period as historically he is a guy who obviously picks up a few niggles here and there so to conclude if I had to pick one right now I think it would be Nicholas Jackson however I do think very quickly Alexander isach is going to be on everybody's radar I just think I want to see a little bit more from him and Newcastle in general before we look to invest in him I wouldn't be buying olle Watkins right now because of that rotation risk and salanki is a keep but I wouldn't necessarily say he's a buy let me know your thoughts in the comments section now let's take a look at some budget midfielders so next up I want to take a look at some of these budget midfielders in the game and the two out options right now are really going to be Morgan Rogers at Aston Villa and seeno at Bournemouth now of course both of these did score in gameweek 10 so that really does help the case when we are analyzing both of those but they have both been over the opening 10 game weeks probably The Stand Out options now Rogers being the slightly cheaper pick he originally started at 5 million now up to 5.4 million a real reflection on how good he has been 0.3 XG per 90 0.31 expected assist per 90 is ridiculous playing in an Aston Villa team who are always solid yes as I mentioned I am a little bit concerned about fatigue in this Aston Villa team and rotation with a busy Christmas period and managing the champions league but Morgan Rogers has proved that he is a bit of a minutes monster and if anybody's going to get consistent minutes over the next eight game weeks I do think it still will be Rogers in this Aston Villa team 2.1 shots per 90 is still solid and when we take a look at someone like seeno he has been an absolute monster in terms of shot volume 4.4 shots per 90 and 0.54 expected goals per 90 some ridiculous underlying numbers and even some creative numbers at two uh 0.22 expected assist per 90 and you can see the expected fpr points 6.13 and he's actually only delivered 4.51 so you would argue that he's actually been underperforming to some extent same with that of Morgan Rogers now when we take a look at the fixtures for Bournemouth brenford away I don't think is a fixture we should be scared about then Brighton at home Wolves Away who having their troubles then Spurs at home and we've seen how good Bournemouth can be at home against the big teams in terms of a villa little bit more mixed Villa away Crystal Palace at home's great and I don't think Chelsea away is too bad then brenford at home now if I was to invest in one right now I do think I would actually lean towards seeno if he had the funds available I think Bournemouth long-term fixtures are really good similar can be said of that of Aston Villa but as I mentioned just because of that extra game in terms of the Champions League that they can have each and every week I think seenu is the one that slightly gets the pick but of course if money is a problem in your team and you can get to Morgan Rogers then I do think he is a great pickup the final thing we need to answer is in terms of a team structure I actually think you could have both of these in your team I think you could easily have someone like a Salah another premium Brian and buo or someone of that price and then actually have Rogers and Sanu as a fourth and fifth midfielder I really do believe they are putting up the numbers to justify being a double up in your team allowing you to bench one of those if you have three forwards that do play and even in a week where you have to play both of those look at gameweek 12 you could easily play Rogers and seenu together and i' would even argue in gameweek 14 is it the worst case scenario if you played both Rogers and seanu on your team I think the answer is going to be no so anybody that is in a position right now where they're looking to wild card in gameweek 12 I would firmly consider both of these on your wild card which will then allow you to have some of those premium forwards that we previously discussed in the other section so let me know who your favorite is in the comment section for me it is just going to be antoan seeno now finally I feel like we haven't touched on defend as much on these top transfer videos so I feel like it's only time for us to get them involved and I have three budget options here for you Lewis Hall at Newcastle C perz of Bournemouth and man United's mazari now first up we need to talk about Lewis hall because he put in a fantastic performance in gameweek 10 against B Saka and he has been very good for Newcastle start of the Season we spoke about his value he then came out of the team for a little bit of a period but it seems like he has now established himself in that Newcastle team and a 4.3 million I think a lot of managers do need to have him on their radar so 0.23 expected assist per 90 is really solid it's the best of the three that we're looking at here and the attempted assist per 90 at 1.68 he is actually being a bit of a creative option in this Newcastle team he isn't just being one of those back three Defenders that sits for buildup play he is actually being expected to kick on and contribute in the final third which is actually a real bonus at 4.3 million when we take a look at someone like a kirz decent underline numbers 0.12 expected assist per 90 attempted assist at nearly one but he is actually getting a little bit shot volume at 0.75 per 90 much better than that of Lewis halls and with Balmer we know that they can put anybody at a game at home similar to that of Newcastle finally we got mazari now this one very much a guy who you're bringing in just for the man united defense and I would say the man united defense hav't been terrible this season and with a new manager coming in I would say mazari is very much more of the riskier pick because he is the more expensive of the three and you're very very much bringing him in with no idea where he's actually going to play now some people are talking about amaron will come in with a wing back system and that could mean that mazari suddenly becomes an essential defender in the game but also could the argument be he might even play as part of the back three and then all you've got is basically a center back in your teams at 4.5 million man united short-term fixures are great Leicester followed by ipswitch and then Everton at home and I do think if you want to jump on a man united Defender it would be mazra but I think if you're looking more long term I actually do think Lewis Hall at 4.3 million is offering fantastic value now of course the only issue we do have is could we eventually see Dan bur stpp in at left back when botman returns quite possibly that is absolutely a situation that could happen but while Lewis H and liament are putting in the performances that they are and Newcastle are slightly turning the tide in terms of their overall results I think LS Hall keeps his place in a 4.3 million in terms of a gameweek 12 entry point at home against West Ham I think that is the time to do so I think cirz for me I think Bournemouth just away from home are unpredictable and I don't think I really would want to go that I'd rather go Lewis Hall but again if you're looking for a Defender this week I do like mazari as an entry point if you can't wait till game week 12 for Lewis Hall let me know your thoughts in the comments so finally we need to take a look at game week 11 and the predicted points because I'm going to put out that I think this is going to be one of the toughest game weeks for captaincy not necessarily because obviously we have bad options I just think it's a case of teams are very split right now we got some managers who are all in on earling Highland we got some managers with no Highland Mo Salalah we got some with no Salah no Highland and I've got people like son and Cole Palmer so it is very divisive going into game week 11 now you can see top of the list is going to be son at 7.3 predicted points as a manager that owns him I am delighted to see that of course the problem with son is playing 55 minutes in gameweek 10 is that a bit of a red flag now of course on Thursday they do have their Europa League game so we need to assess what exactly happens with son but again we have to paint our own narratives here if son doesn't travel with the squad is that actually good news is that bad news for me just to put my cards on the table I feel like s going off in the 55th minute he was surprised he was angry I think that was the sport doctors telling him that based on just the general science that we have nowadays I think with the richison injury I think son's minutes are going to heavily improve in this IP switch game unless we see anything bad on Thursday night and I'm going to put my head on the line here and say I do think son is the best capy option I have to say that because of course I own him as well and it'd be terrible if I don't Captain him myself but I do think he is the standout option and I do think we will get 75 to 18 minutes of him in gameweek 11 now looking outside of son if you want to play safe I do think Mo Salah is the choice of 6.9 predicted points obviously Villa at home in gameweek 11 and with Villa playing in the Champions League I think they have been a little bit lackluster in the game after Champions League fixtures and I think Liverpool because they're dominating the ball so much more in both the champions league and the Premier League they are not getting fatigued like some other teams so I think mosalah is the safe pick for those that kept ear and hland you'll be happy to know 6.1 predicted points yes they got battered in the Champions League but I always always back erling hen to score and if you're a manager that doesn't have son doesn't have Mo Salah I would still confidently put the captaincy on Harland and not panic about it too much outside of that emo an interesting differential Captain personally I don't love it I would much rather go for some of the premiums Johnson again not a capy pick but still a great option for those managers that do have him and Cole Palmer at 5.2 again I just cannot put a capy on someone who has played a top team like Arsenal outside of that if you want to go differential with salanki 4.6 predicted points a very interesting pick there so let me know who your captain is in the comment section I'll be super interested to know and as always thank you so much for tuning in today's video if you have any questions pop them in the comment section and make sure you do like and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you in the next one take care cheers oh,3353,yes guys welcome back to another fantasy football fix youtube video my name is f naturo and in todays video we are taking a look at those top transfers going into gw 11 were going to prioritize those premium forwards and some of those budget midfielders so as always if you look forward todays video make sure you do drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button without further ado lets get into todays video so first up as i mentioned i want to touch on these premium forwards because i think a lot of the conversation over the last few weeks has all been about the budget forwards chris wood kuna visa just to name a few but i do think we might be getting into the time of year where the premium forwards do stand out as the best value picks in the game in that forward department been a lot of talk about selling erling hland currently the most sold player and i do think there is justification maybe to come down from him not all the way to the budget forwards but this bracket forward were going to take a look at these four here dominic salanki of course off the back at that 16point hall in gw 10 congratulations to anybody that did keep hold of him nicholas jackson little bit disappointing in game week 10 but still putting up great numbers alexander isak a little bit of a rejuvenation were seeing the best of him over the last three games and of course ole watkins mr consistent so the big question is first and foremost who is the best one and then secondly should we be spending the money to come up from our cheaper forwards or downgrade from earling hland so first up we have to talk about dominic sanki everybody who kept hold of him were rewarded in gw 10 and i still think there are going to be rewards in game week 11 at home against ip switch its worth noting when we look at the actual underlying numbers over the course of the season so the opening 10 game weeks theyve been good i know a lot of people have been worried about him over the past two or three game weeks but again there are so many factors that we need to take into consideration if youre just analyzing the last few games and sans numbers at 063 per 90 have always been solid and whats interesting to me is a lot of people are saying that dominick sanki has been dropping deep being much more of a harry kane character linking up the play being creative well at 06 expected assists thats not necessarily paintting the whole picture so i still think he is a brilliant goal threat in this spurs team big chances at 127 as well is third second best on this list but still good regardless the big problem with salanki of course is that ip switch at home is brilliant but then man city away is that a tough fixture right now you could be the judge of that then fulham at home and bournemouth away now in terms of nicholas jackson i would argue in terms of longevity in terms of fixures this is probably the pick yes arsenal at home is not the entry point for many people but then leicester away villa at home and then southampton away is a good set of fixtures and they continue beyond that until the new year nicholas jacksons numbers very similar to that of sankis in terms of xg per 90 expected assists slightly higher and the same in terms of big chances so nicholas jackson is the same as dominic sanki but i would argue that jackson probably has slightly more rotation risk in the sense of christopher and kungu now jackson will start pretty much every game as long as he is fit but there is definitely the risk of rotation during this busy christmas period but i still think nicholas jackson longterm is a fantastic pick for our teams and he does a bit of both contributes in terms of the goals and in terms of the creativity in this chelsey team now finally the last two before we come to some conclusion alexander isach only just coming on radar he was the talker the time during preseason picked up the injury little bit of a slow start were finally seeing the best of him now 45 expected goals per 90 over these last 10 game weeks but we are as i mentioned only seeing the best of him now 08 big chances per 90 is a slight concern and i would expect in some of these better fixtures for that to improve but the big thing is are the fixtures worth investing in forest have proved to be a tough cookie recently so i dont think that is a great entry point west ham at home is great in gw 12 then palace away leaking goals then liverpool at home so i think similar to nicholas jackson you dont look to invest in this sa this week it is the case of next week finally oe watkins now at 9m we have to be confident and invest in an ollie watkins to pay the premium especially when we got people like salanki at 14m cheaper now the underlying numbers are great 075 expected goals per 90 he always is going to be the one that has the best numbers because we have seen it now over the last 18 months that this guy is consistently the man in this astonvilla team 15 big chances per 90 as well yes there is that hindrance in terms of john ran i do think he will steal minutes off him whether it be a start in one of maybe the next six games because we need to remember villa trying to manage champions league and premier league and a busy period i think there could be some rotation in oe watkins in either the brenford game or the following southampton game in gw 14 i believe so we need to keep an eye on that because john duran is definitely knocking on the door but one thing we need to remember is that john duran is taking minutes away from other assets in the team like a morgan rogers so i dont think watkins is just a direct rotation risk but his minutes are definitely a problem longer term in terms of those 90 minutes so to conclude we need to remember that gw 12 is probably the entry point for a lot of these forwards the case of jackson isach and ole watkins if you own dominic sanki i would absolutely keep and reassess after the international break if you have the funds available to go to someone like a nicholas jackson i do like it i think the chelsea team are good offensively i think nicholas jacks minutes are great and i dont see much rotation risk longterm for him as i would see with someone like a ole watkins alexander isach is probably the punt but 83m with callum wilson returning from injury very soon i will be a little bit concerned about isaks minutes over the christmas period as historically he is a guy who picks up a few niggles here and there so to conclude if i had to pick one right now i think it would be nicholas jackson however i do think very quickly alexander isach is going to be on everybodys radar i just think i want to see a little bit more from him and newcastle in general before we look to invest in him i wouldnt be buying olle watkins right now because of that rotation risk and salanki is a keep but i wouldnt necessarily say hes a buy let me know your thoughts in the comments section now lets take a look at some budget midfielders so next up i want to take a look at some of these budget midfielders in the game and the two out options right now are going to be morgan rogers at aston villa and seeno at bournemouth now of course both of these did score in gw 10 so that does help the case when we are analyzing both of those but they have both been over the opening 10 game weeks probably the stand out options now rogers being the slightly cheaper pick he originally started at 5m now up to 54m a real reflection on how good he has been 03 xg per 90 031 expected assist per 90 is ridiculous playing in an aston villa team who are always solid yes as i mentioned i am a little bit concerned about fatigue in this aston villa team and rotation with a busy christmas period and managing the champions league but morgan rogers has proved that he is a bit of a minutes monster and if anybodys going to get consistent minutes over the next eight game weeks i do think it still will be rogers in this aston villa team 21 shots per 90 is still solid and when we take a look at someone like seeno he has been an absolute monster in terms of shot volume 44 shots per 90 and 054 expected goals per 90 some ridiculous underlying numbers and even some creative numbers at two 022 expected assist per 90 and you can see the expected fpr points 613 and hes only delivered 451 so you would argue that hes been underperforming to some extent same with that of morgan rogers now when we take a look at the fixtures for bournemouth brenford away i dont think is a fixture we should be scared about then brighton at home wolves away who having their troubles then spurs at home and weve seen how good bournemouth can be at home against the big teams in terms of a villa little bit more mixed villa away crystal palace at homes great and i dont think chelsea away is too bad then brenford at home now if i was to invest in one right now i do think i would lean towards seeno if he had the funds available i think bournemouth longterm fixtures are good similar can be said of that of aston villa but as i mentioned just because of that extra game in terms of the champions league that they

3,AboveAverageFPL,dkrhrRzo8qg,GW11 Team Selection w/ FPL Chai | All About Spurs | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-11-07T22:10:49Z,"[Music] me [Music] right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam I'm always joined by Baker and this evening we' got chai how you doing chai you right all good Adam thank you for having me on uh cheers boys actually quite um often listen to the show and I'm here to share the most biased Spurs opinions you've had so far sounds good that's what we that's what we're all about we're all about Spurs um the main man on the uh the main man on the thumbnail and um obviously big week for us fixture wise and we've obviously just watched us play Galatasaray with uh which is slightly awkward it didn't feel ideal but um firstly before we go I mean we'll touch on that but how are you doing bakeer you right oh good mate all good it's obviously I mean I'm on Co Palmer watch really which is a weird one actually for me because I've also got double Arsenal defense I mean like I want Palmer to play and I see want him um um and I want him to beat Arsenal as well to be fair um but I'm like also oh if he doesn't play do that make me better or worse I'm not even sure but yes uh fairly big weekend fairly big captaincy Choice yes and an opportunity to talk Tottenham and to be fair like we are pure Spurs bias and don't have the great historical ranks and so forth but uh last season so T where did you finish last season um 1, 1839 um of course that was a season that created FPL CH I suppose um but we spent like I want to say like 30 game weeks in the top 100 we're fluctuating from second to 10th for a few weeks and just shared a journey had a bit of Buzz did you did you think you did you think you had a chance to win it I genuinely from the bottom of my heart everything was going in my way I genuinely thought I was gonna win it all uh but come game week I think 30ish um flop the wild card I was like ah maybe it's not my season you do need that bit of luck in the in the running to make it to make it happen and I know we obviously spoke to Jamie when he won it and yeah I think it was like gameweek 34 he did a couple of things that just looked a bit strange but he brought like kdb in and then capped him in 36 when he got the massive you know 60 pointer for him and um and that rocketed him and then obviously never looked back from there so yeah you do need you do need things in those final weeks to go your way yeah you need to be a really really sub optimal manager I'm not going to lie um that's why I got quite a bit of criticism I can completely understand you know I'm doing things that normal people wouldn't do and it's working out it's just a bit of luck and timing as well and it be calculating a small bit of your look um but you have to roll the dice to have a chance when you up there did you feel like you uh did at some point you realized that you were taking a lot of risks and obviously got there and then when you were like could I win did you take more risks or did you did you change anything during because obviously a lot of eyes were on you suddenly for being where you were for that did you feel like that changed one how you felt about like how you played and two like what was the pressure like and did you even enjoy it I genuinely think that's what made it enjoyable was the fact that I could do whatever I wanted and for some reason it would work at the time um like I genuinely felt like a madman like it was so weird it's like it revolved around me no matter what I done like esally Pascal gross like that was his breakout season for Brighton I want to say he was phenomenal he was coming up with everything um but little things throughout the season every single week were just slowly gravitating towards me um in terms of how enjoyable it was I would say like the initial stage you know I get my Twitter account rolling um start making a YouTube channel it's all very exciting you get to speak like to people all over the world um and people like ye start popping up um that part is really enjoyable but then it gets to a point where it's like ah you know there all always a on you and things stop going your way which is normal you expect that and then you feel a bit more pressure and a small bit anxious on a weekly basis so good to be grounded this season I'm currently sat at 1.5 million uh but I enjoy the season just as much as any other and I'm looking forward to see if we can top it that's what that's what we need that's what we're waiting for we're waiting for that one breakout season where we can go right we're in the top 100 and then and then we just get a ton of followers from all from all of that we're trying to that's what we're waiting for we waiting for it for a while I don't know whether it's ever going to come but might be a while it might be it might be a while especially especially if I for me anyway if I keep doing things like bringing in Matas Nunes in a week where I probably should be bringing in Salah um wow but that is so Captain Spurs all Captain Spurs I think I think that's it I mean there's obviously there's there's so many different people are on so many different paths at the moment you've got people who are sitting on Harland wondering what to do without Salah you've got people sitt on Salah bind Harland well they have well they have both you got some people that are sitting there with a wild card coming up in a week's time as well um there's a there's a big fixture swing about to happen for a number of teams there quite a lot I think there's a lot of focus on like what our teams are going to be for game week 11 but I think a lot of what the decisions that you make other than if you're wild carding I think really revolve on what you're going to do from 12 onwards funny enough so as much as we look at the fixtures this weekend and you know you know obviously Spurs is the fixture that you know everyone's kind of looking at at for for obvious reasons and um I forgot to put in the slide about the the the um was it the Huddle uh graphic showing like the the XG sort of plot I forgot that I'll put it in at some point when you guys are talking but um yeah so so there is a definite mismatch I mean there's it's it's pretty obvious um yeah I mean ITP switch it's tot switch you know it switch away from home this season like it's quite a step change obviously they've had some hard fixtures but 16 XG they've conceded away from home the most goals conceded with 13 it's it's quite comfortably as well I think Leicester and next are like 14 and then Southampton at 12 like it's it's big I guess the other stuff is you know when you look at their away stats as well with whips which they haven't pressed at all away from home they've literally sat back and you're like I don't know how that's going to you know the best way to get a to the moment is to press them high themselves you know and try and turn the ball over but they've they've allowed teams to press them really highly you know is is is again you know it all just looks like a delicious fixture um and we are very much a home team like we are having big issues away from home continually it feels like teams have sort of worked us out a little and are able to try and really exploit that at home for some reason when they come to the sort of big stadium is broken should be back up now oh we're brok I'm not broke we'll get a comment in chat saying we're lagging but then it will come straight back amazing um yeah so yeah it felt like some I said he he put some put some runs in but realistically like it felt like it would just didn't really want to be there and I'm like I don't know how many minutes we're going to get out some on the weekend cut out again oh no just trying to pick it up now are we back you should be back should be back how many minutes so was a Qui so chai you challenged us there go on how many minutes are we saying I'm going to say 70 75 for me Adam yeah I think 75 is fine um and I think that's enough I think that's enough CU I think game should be done and dusted by then if there's anything that we know about Spurs is the first 15 to 20 minutes that second half is is where things can happen and if he's on the pitch for the first half then great so I think that works fine for me I think what we have seen from AG is the substitutions a little bit Pain by numbers a little bit in some of the some of the some of the minutes for example so it definitely feels like he trusts the sport Science said guys so if they say sun 75 if we're if it's nil nil it'll still take him off on 75 if it's 5 nil it'll take it off from 75 you know what I mean it's not like sometimes substitutions or the minutes that we see every weekend are a lot game State related you know for example if they're not winning harland's always playing 0 I mean is is if if it's three or four goals in the back well that's probably the time where he gets the rest um so I don't think Sun's one of those where it's like 75 minutes if he comes off in 75 minutes it's because he's done all the damage and if they hadn't done the damage yet he'll play to the end I don't think that is the case with I think you know like we saw last week with the Villa game like he looked like he was about to explode in that game um and then just get saing off because and just like no that's the minutes I think especially when you consider the setback he he's after foret they're trying to put um a cotton blanket around him now especially so I'd be more than happy with subing them off regardless of the game State like you said um hopefully see Mikey Moore get 15 20 minutes i' love that yeah I mean virus I mean You' just be he' just be resting up bit of oofin warm blanket and it'll be fine by the weekend you'd assume wouldn't you unless he's got like Angela fever type thing yeah it sounded like well yeah Phil ability for it so we think that minutes um Ron's out so sanki minutes solid you'd think night minutes for salanki wouldn't you yeah I would say so yeah I think that's why I would lean towards the sank captaincy I'm sure we'll get onto it um over Sunny um I don't know if if you had son do you have son one and if you had son and you had the pair who would you be more likely to show the AR so me and Adam have got both got slank and Son okay full bias Warriors you've got have you got both I've got salanki you got salanki but not son um yeah I am I'm in same position I I would Captain sank over some this weekend I think my my battle is salanki V Salah not S V Salah this weekend yeah I would agree with that 100% fair enough what about you I don't know I think I prefer I think I prefer son I just think I Adam by the way if Adam says fair enough it means he what he actually means is I don't agree a little bit I don't know why he says fa off tell us what you mean yeah tell us tell us um well I mean you know I know that you a week ago said to me that you wouldn't triple Captain Harland over Salah because the midfielders are so good and they telling me that you want to go for the striker over in Spurs instead of the midfielder so I'm not I'm not because because I'm currently on Sal because I still think the midfielders are the options for it but um there is the question in the chat if what if you had salanki and Brennan oh Noank I think for me what edges it is you know especially now that I'm ejected in my own mind 70 minutes for sun let say slank is on penalties for 20 25 minutes if in that case um and we don't get many penalties not to say one as you but somewhere in my mind I'm like that's more appetizing than captain and Sun for me we don't get any penalties because we don't because we don't have the profile of Winger that's going to drive into the box and take people on we have the profile of Winger that's going to cross early and the other Winger is just going to be standing on the six yard line so either get I mean he might get fouled but not many not many Defenders make rash challenges in that area of the pitch normally the Winger just Taps it in so yeah the pens thing I'm not sure i' put any weight on it for Spurs personally yeah yeah that's valid we don't get any like exactly as you said oogi and Brenan both both of them they make the they make the runs you know the sort of driving runs that go past everybody else and they tend to just hit it first time they tend to just drive it across first time that said I mean I did watch I did watch Salah absolutely rinse Leaf Davis I know that was a while ago now but like defensively Leaf Davis is not going to be he's not going to be up to Brennan's pace so it could be a week where he does well might back might just back it as an anytime goal score and just leave it at that the out ofed the hell out of it you can't lose then exactly I I just I wouldn't C Brandon over over the others I think it's I think it's really unpredictable um what what we'll see from him I definitely think he'll have he'll definitely have a big chance that's what you definitely almost know where brenon is he finds ways to have a big chance you you'd expect that against I witch as well um but even if he seems to have a big chance it's very rare that Brennan also gets top bonus as well yeah because he he works in limited touches like his is his thing is not to pass the ball around his thing is not to even cross the ball very often his thing is to just arrive in the right place and tap the ball in really um Del Ali sty yeah yeah it's kind of the old school like like type um Baseline as well like six or seven like it's just it's never it's it's so unlikely to be enough compared to what we're seeing from the M Sun's creativity at the moment that's that is the best thing about with sun is that you've got huge amount of cre creativity I think the thing with son that I worry about is it's almost too cre like you know that he's much much more disciplined than Brenan in terms of he will stay on his wing absolutely um I think especially this season I I don't know why um it's actually quite interesting to watch because he he's so relaxed and he mightn't be in the game for periods of the game and suddenly he'll do something like we were used to seeing like wow you know he's still there at 32 or whatever I think he's 32 um do you still think he's got it do you think he's at you think he's past the peak of his Paris I think he knows his game more I think it is that bit that we've seen it with like those sort of mature guys I mean we're seeing it with leowski at Barcelona now you know in in that sense of those guys don't lose it they just know their games more and I think he knows this game more is if if they want to offer width he's just unlikely to beat people with 20 30 yard runs so he just holds his position more than anything else he's creating space for others and his creativity like his creativity is just get better and better the cross last week for the Brennan go was fantastic um yeah I don't I don't hate the sunat I really don't um but I Dom would Edge it for me at the moment in terms of from from the Spurs guys and I just don't know if I like those more than I like Liverpool fair enough I think I did manage to put this together just in time just to just to show that XG difference um City obviously top of that uh with about plus one plus .95 something like that spurs in second at about seven something like that and then I switch down at minus 1.1 and you know that's it's it's quite clear and and as much as you saw I mean I wouldn't take today's game against Galatasaray as a yard stick for how te well realistically how we're going to defend however we are possibly going to be missing our two center backs on on uh on the weekend like you were you were talking about porro bringing in por po this week Baker like how I mean is it is it today that's really maybe you know called that slightly well well I think I think Romero is going to be okay I would not be surprised at all if Romero plays um and I'd be really really really surprised if Madison plays um so we are we are looking at par set pieces um we have you know IP switch are without Greaves like it's their best header um yeah I'm just trying to work out who who who would win who would win headers for us just Dom somehow Ben Davies wins so more H than any man I've ever seen he misses them all but but like somehow he seems to always win the header that's there Dragon obviously can win a header Romer and Dom can um but I do expect for at least 70 minutes of the game that par set pieces yeah no that's fair um which which does tempt me whereever you want to use a transfer again still on Defenders at the moment Defenders are just so painful of whether I'd want to use one there and obviously you're using you're bringing a guy in that you're almost certainly just going to bench next week against m City yeah yeah I me I've got 18 and a half million in my starting Defenders at the moment it's painful it's painful when I have 13 and a half it' be I feel a lot more comfortable exactly exactly I'm not I'm not ruling out that you know if I looked at still what parro versus say Dow because I think they're probably the two there like Dow canate and parro all very similar prices that five to five and a half million I look at them I think I like him I I love that Al one I was actually going to bring him up um especially when this new maner comes in he plays Five the back and I think under 10 hag we've seen Dow play so Advanced you know it'll always tend to uh keep clean sheets throughout the season I don't know how they do it doesn't matter how good or bad they are they'll always keep some clean sheets and of course the favorable favorable fixtures H coming up so I really do like that one I mean if there's a if there's a if there's obviously an entry point it's these two games right it's it is these two games absolutely for sure and I think there's even there's even opportunity to have him as a make play for or um maybe not Dow but if you're looking to get into the Midfield there's possibilities to get into get in and out of manual assets just for a couple of games and you know there's people talking about hland as well which is fair yeah again I'm looking for me Harry just in the chat doesn't Sun take some set pieces weird so sun looks like direct free I imagine direct free kicks is probably going to be sun over over por probably um if Madison's not on the pitch um game before last I did not notic that um I think it was when Madison went off the pitch that sun did take some corners but last game that was straight back to parro now maybe you might say it was well he had tight hamstrings and whatever therefore he didn't get him to take the set pieces but it looked like they' just gone back um it did look like porro was only taking them from the left side wasn't he it was mainly kosi was out on the right one orbe they always did that short corner to parro they love that don't they they love it love it they love it so yeah I think the majority of the stuff will still be through par um should we get the fixtures up we can look at the fixtures first of all got say hello to everyone in the YouTube chat so shout out to you guys for joining us and watching us maybe you've just got us in the background white or you've got us in the foreground and you've got man united in the background that's what we're hoping that's what we're assuming you don't need to listen to the commentary um you can listen to us that's cool um so shout out to you and as always shout out to crypto blown for his support for the podcast uh we really appreciate it we've got a couple of weeks to go until the FCA So for anybody that did vote for us thanks for that um looking forward to that you uh you tried your suit on today didn't you Baker I tried uh I am a man that's been working at home for the last eight years and when I do go to the office it's a very modern type office you wear you know chinos polo shirt that type of world I haven't put a suit on for yes at least I reckon I reckon it's at least 8 I was trying to what play play back through in my head somehow got a wider back how do you get a wider back as you get older I don't even know that's possible cuz I could get my Trails up but I was like oh my God I'm have to go suit shopping this weekend I'm have to do it this week because the was away next weekend amazing um yeah we can we can sure look at fixtures but while we're looking at fixtures people have got to make sure they hit that like button if they enjoy what they're watching SL listening to and um and make sure you subscribe uh if you want to see more from us uh heading towards 9k Subs want to get to 10K I'm hoping we're arranging like a decent sized giveaway for 10K so we just just pop that in there as a little little Cherry so make sure you subed because it's going to be for anyone that's subbed um there might be some other teas and sees around that but yeah it will be for subscribers basically and we have as you we have to grind it cuz we ain't going to get there by being number two in the world Mr chai no no no no we'll get there don't worry twice a week begging no we're not begging but um yeah let's look at some let's look at some games so as always we look at the data that comes from Rob T the data that comes from spreadex and we're looking at basically expected goals in a particular matchup as well as a percentage chance of a clean sheet um Big Ticket items Spurs we've spoken about and with the highest percentage chance of a clean sheet this week 38% and then we're looking at United at home to Leicester 2.45 with a 36% chance of a clean sheet so like second second and then you're looking at Liverpool third with 2.35 and 32% chance of a clean sheet um once again like not many games where we're expecting to see cleans really and there's lots of one ORS and two ons hanging around all over the place wherever you go no 40% whatsoever none like 40% so are like yes over 40 you can start thinking there there's a good chance of it none I mean 38% in Spurs might as well be 20% to be honest yeah that's what you know it's bad like when we are nearly topping it like liable defense this weekend what you're in some trouble so let me POS some questions to you let's go to the defense let's do the the defense stuff um r leis if you got him have we all got him yeah I've got him y do you play him not at the moment you got about 12 so so you got you got some options I'll I'll sit back you been Leaf Davis last week so you know um I can't start mikeno over Lewis the the upside of Lewis is just too high for me to not start where is this upside we keep I keep talking about it but he you're going to score goals he stands in the Box a lot right that's that's the big upside isn't it he never nobody ever passes to him but like he stands in the Box a lot he's just there he's like a poor man's MOS know what I mean like like at least MOS got the assist last week but but but that's s Guy where they just they're always around but they're not actually doing and touching the ball in the right spaces is but you look at this and I'm like I'm in similar position where it's mikeno is the option if I was to not play him but it's whever he gets in the team yeah that's the big question like for me I have no doubt West have I'm going to score against Everton I don't know why it's just one of these fixtures where can see goals when I we look at it that way like I'm not too high on ever and clean sheet it's like why wouldn't I start Rico Lewis even if I'm worried about his minut I don't know I don't know do you think he'll start oh actually I'm 50/50 and I think that 50% is hope for I think it start I think it start CU Walker was just so bad he yeah I just think in a way though the the worst part about them even just midweek was that we keep talking about it the Midfield don't track like they do actually need him to invert a bit more and provide some legs into that Midfield because I'd much rather they were playing three big center backs and and then Rico was inverting but they're not really doing that much because vardal is clearing off it's not like you know what I mean like it's not like when you think about like last season with Trent where he sort came in Midfield and Robertson stayed back as that left Center back but the problem is vard's so high then you stick Rico Lewis up there and you're like I just I don't know I mean to be fair whoever it's going to be is going to get pinned back because obviously matoma is just going to have whoever it is just yeah you chasing chasing the tail like against porro similar game against Trent last week honestly as I said I if canart got injured I'm sure Trent was coming off at our time because he was just mat was just taking the piss at's class he's been class this season as well I thought he so impressive against us he Randa shock yeah yeah yeah he's already made an absolute mockery of por and Trend this season and I look up against Rico LS and I'm [Music] like and you know know that if he's on the bench he's going to come on 100% so is it is it upside versus [Laughter] meleno I don't know I mean I don't I don't think that I don't think the city will clean this week so I'm comfortable in benching him for whoever I think I mean well yours isn't forever though who's your other free Defenders well my other free Defenders are Gabrielle porro and Trent well yours is not in the conversation you're obviously going to Ben I'm very comfortable B get this all over twinter TW I'm benching leis this week you're like who is it well I've got probably the best free Defenders anyone could literally got the best fre Defenders anyone could have this week okay yeah yeah oh wa he just said V was not keeping it clean so you true I I have got the best three this is true it's true I'll be we you know you're not in you're not in the game of mikeno wait I was I'm never ever you know I'm never ever going to be in that game yeah yeah yeah I don't don't get involved with with championship Defenders you got Leaf Davis mate yeah I know I know yeah but I don't play him that's true he just there as well for celebrations um I know it's a bit of a a left field swerve but Matias has dropped us a super chat so let's just get a big just a quick uh quick answer for him so he said we've spoken about Spurs and we've spoken about United already briefly so pick two out of son salang holand and Bruno you want to go first Baker I mean who's he asking this to I don't know I don't know whether he can have two mids two Strikers do you want one of each well I'll just something than you thanks very much that's I think I go I think I go uh yeah I think son and salanki I can't I can't say Bruno and salanki if I'm going to Captain son over salanki can I that's like just makes no sense whatsoever if if it's for this week I'm going salanki and Bruno yeah I don't hate that noty but I'd also prefer to capan Harry FPL Harry says I'd play grees versus Spurs if I could course you would Harry you liar of course I mean to be fair if Harry if Harry did that he'd score yeah he would definitely score that's how that's how this game works we know we know how this game works Harry absolutely we're familiar with your game Harry as soon as you soon as you're plugged in to the the official FPL guys and you know you start getting these so let's look around some other other decisions uh hey I need I need you guys to talk to me about this one Ry or fabiany listen this so I on world card E I think it was I obviously you have to pick a second keeper I I had Joel Ward at the time and I meant to put in fabianski and I didn't click save I'm delighted I didn't because I'd be having a benching headache with ederson this week um obviously I think ederson is probably the favorable one but I'm actually happy I don't have a second goalkeeper to mess around with um who would I choose in that situation I think it has to be rare 24% chance playing for Aral I choose fabianski 28% I me the only risk I mean this this is the thing though like for for 70 70 minutes of the game at the weekend he was like the worst Keeper of the world's ever seen and then for the last 20 minutes he was basically bof on I mean so I don't even know whether he's gonna start but then if he's not going to start it doesn't matter because you're gonna get Ry in anyway but I think if you're G to pick the fixure I would pick West Ham for this one because you know Betto Betto provided um a great example that he also does Miss big chances and if like if D plays DCL then you know you cash money aren't you basically oh mate you know exactly what's I'm gonna play I'm GNA play fabianski I'm GNA bench DCL and DCL is going to score in five minutes against fabianski that that's how FPL works baby yeah I mean Harry Harry's right actually if what if Palmer's if Palmer's not fit then you play Ry that's exactly my point I I was looking at it as if Palmer's not it um but if he is yeah fabians one you guys need to carry on for a sec I need to I need to nip out for a sec because my child is still uh still awake so uh oh uh hopefully the stream stays up fingers crossed but we'll we'll find out just a second let's let's do man united you just talked about them and you like the idea of D this week and just in general stats are good but it's early we're still on rude time before we get to mrm um is it too early to go on on this week no I think if you're going to do it it has to be this week surely well I guess the problems I've got with it is the three players well there's four players I think that are people like d gacho Brun and hland and I do have slight question marks over every single one of them about where they sit in the new system because we expect D played left back again tonight probably play who knows where he plays on the weekend but like what if what if amam just says I'll play masi right back and I want somebody to play the left and maybe that's even gacho plays left wing back and suddenly it's like what do we do with him but we just we don't know and are they are they like such a slam dunk team that I can go well I know what I'm going to get from from d i I don't know and then I'm like well he could also Play 3 4 2 1 and is that cuz he's played a lot amim and therefore I'm like where does Bruno sit in that is Bruno Bruno could be the nine then he's the best player in the game um Bruno could be in one of the two behind one of the best players in the game Bruno could be in the pivot not one of the best players in the game um caracho yeah same deal like where is he and that b and oand again same deal like is he the nine that's going to be the one if he's going to be the nine and he's going to everything's going to be about him then he's just a fantastic pick so basically what you're telling is Bruno is the best option yeah probably he's the most reli of those ones he the most reliable I would agree it it feels like he's the one where it feels like yeah that's the one that you would go to but yeah the hland one is one it's probably hland is one it's easy hland and do they easy two for me to get to cuz if wanted to move on Lewis or move on DCL and I'm looking at those guys and thinking maybe I should um and maybe I should go this week when it's home to Leicester we just talked about the worst away xgs and only shortly behind whips which is Leicester I suppose it depends on your risk appetite though because you know between now and then you're not expecting much change in the team um and even in that first week when he comes in like to think he won't mix it up too much do was too crazy um again he easily could but I don't know I do like for sure Bruno again I don't know what your stance was H before the season started when he was doing rubbish and then now I was always high on Bruno again I don't think he was a bad pick I I had him myself and I think go for the season yeah yeah he looks quite good I want to say again you knowed are so they're such a big question mark on them but again it's those question mark players that if you get right they're what Elevate you um because people aren't on them I mean he's just he's just it's the players around him that are causing him the problem it's not it's not him actually that's that's the issue I mean he's not getting it was obviously the F the first game against Fulham where he gets those two big chances you feel like you feel like if he scores one or both of those then like the season just takes off right and everybody has him and what and you know it it just Carries On from strength to strength but you know rashford's finishing has been average gacho's finishing is you know it's always average um he just hasn't had really the the supporting acts with him to you know to make it work hland scored a couple of good goals but again everything just started to go a bit sour at the end of the sort of the ten hog stuff so you know maybe this is a fresh start maybe this is you know we don't I don't expect I expect like Bruno's output to increase I mean it has to like it simply just has to it has to it does it can't be La yeah yeah I agree especially with a player at his standard like he but I don't expect his data I don't expect his expected data to change like I expect that not to not to drop because of a change in a change in management here I don't think that's going to happen yeah I agree with that I think the thing on Bruno's I expect his XA to go up but his XG will only naturally go up because Bruno is Bruno is objectively a really really bad finisher like he's I'm going to say he's like like bottom tier finisher like when he's one-on-one you you expect him to miss almost every time he gets a shot within the six-yard box but what he is is is an incredible ball Striker so if you look at his goals he misses a ton of 04.5 XG chances and he scores a load of less than 0.1 XG chances which then gets him back to up for it yeah yeah yeah yeah so when his overall XG is there but when you look at when you look at the number of chances that he misses that are not 0.2 0.3 0.4 XG it's a significant number so he always has bits he will always have Parts where he looks like he's massively under his XG and then hey guess what by the end of the season he gets back because he he will at some point probably in these next few games score a goal that's like 0.1 XG it's what he does um but yeah like we saw it just on the weekend like header he had about .3 n he's going to when he get when through and he was like six yards out with a header there's not there's not a fan alive that watched it that thought he's going to put that in the goal nobody does like like he just doesn't um but when the ball rolls to him and he's 20 yards out you just think he's going to stroke in the corner um I think BR has an excellent excellent choice with these next three fixtures um and especially I think there were people that planning maybe go Palmer this week as an option there'll be a few now where they're thinking well I just got Bruno at the moment Bruno for a couple and then yeah I mean I me I'm inan exactly that boat exactly exactly that boat um right now if I can if I can find but then the only one I mean the only way for me to find the money is to sell Harland and that kind of sucks because it's two transfers it's a minus four and like you got it last week I mean you I say got away with it but you you know you managed to cover your hit last week by selling Harland but that wasn't a fun experience was it oh it's not fun sorry um it's never fun have we spoken go on it's okay as soon as as soon as your soon as you've got scores like as soon as he scores it was fun like like like it was even if he' scored at the end I was like well I'm not losing now um you know you do need you need your players to hit if you haven't got Harland and they miss like if they miss um but you've got more chance that your players will hit if you don't have Harland in your team because the overall quality of the rest of your team is much much better because you spend 15 million yeah completely agree and that was how I was born last season no one else was going without H it literally what I was doing man it's so mad how it works out but the game is so much more enjoyable for me without him I'm back with no hland I went I done the move last week with h kuna and Salah and I feel rejuvenated again got nice agree now and I can't wait for him to score a hatch versus Brighton this week where I don't own him yeah I do know it's going to happen but that's exactly the position I felt like straight away the second the previous game we finished was like I want to have my options to have anybody that I want in this game and the best way for me to do that is to not have Harland um and back yourself that you can pick the players around it that that will work he's going to hurt at some point though yeah he is he is SP is just a game in know yeah game wolves assets any other talk about wolves wolves assets because I mean again we got to talk cuz people either have already gone but they've um they're maybe not sure about the decision they've made or there's still people looking at whether they should pick kuna or strand lson or I mean like if you want a Defender from wolves then it's Ain Nori or nothing basically um but there was something interesting again Rob Rob T is just like cracking out smashing out these fantastic uh fantastic ones was the wrong one this one with the goal shares by game week and it's pretty close it's pretty close between COA and and St lson he does get a higher share generally um you know if they both score obviously if they both contribute then or if they both score then Co is getting Co is getting the bonus but I mean I don't know whether cabia coming back in makes a difference I don't really think so well I think cabia got in all the places that you'd want to be in that's a problem like when I look at it and think oh well and and for stran lson if he's got cabia and can putting it on a plate for him then that's good for him full stop like I think he's a really good option do you want to double up an attack with both of them this tough is it it's tough but okay this week it's tough but it's cheap as well it's just how often you can bring yourself to do it because the numbers are still bad now everyone's going to say yeah but of course they're bad cuz the fixtures they've had and all that stuff but they're still really really really bad like they are now as an overall lowest in the entire league for XG when would we ever do it when would in any world would we go I want double attack I want both forwards from the worst attack in the league I suppose what surely you wouldn't classify wolves as one of the worst attacking teams in the league would you like surely this is a good chance for them to maybe gain some and get back into the 14 15th [Music] realm but it also around this though it sways this like this chart will looking at here when there's very very small samples It's All In Pockets because frankly that's the only place it's going to yeah if you looked at if you did this with Tottenham for example it's going to be wider because there's more goals you do it with Liverpool you do it in man city like even with man city you'll have one big guy but everybody else is quite spread because they creating so much when the team's not created hardly anything it's going to be limited where they where they where these play out yeah kind of kind of half I mean it kind of half reminds me of you know the son Kane season that we saw however on on obviously on a a tear down from there I mean the fixtures the fixtures you can you can build whatever narrative you want around the fixtures because we haven't seen fixture run like this before and I don't think you know they have to basically run they basically have to run as probably like the fourth or fifth fifth best team for the next nine weeks to get back in amongst it really cuz if they don't they're still going to be bottom by Christmas yes and it's whether you trust it's whether you trust that they can do that I don't know it's it's funny that you you compared it to son and and Kane but if P Spartans in the chat compared it to Emanuel Dennis Josh King which people did double up on and that worked out they did brilliantly well I mean it only really worked out badly because Emanuel Dennis got sent off in a double trip I I had had plenty of Josh King That season it didn't work out good for me even yeah I I seem to remember not having either of them because I said they were bad players from a bad team oh oh yeah oh I mean I'm not doubling up I'm not doubling up let's not let's not be around it um but then also wolves are not a promoted side no so I think there are worse attacks yeah I know know I I literally talked about on Sunday I was really impressed with how they moved the ball v Palace but I also noticed that when someone moves the ball at them like they just they can do what they like that's cool though because I don't I don't have their def I mean I'm talk me personally like don't have their defense just have their attack then or just have one of their attackers and you can by by looks of this you can pretty much pick either one and it's probably okay yeah yeah it's probably okay it's probably okay it's probably okay but not both no um well look at this look at this this is it this is it this this projection is here so let's count how many let's count how many people were projected to get more goals than Strand lson and then I wish You' have asked I wish you'd have asked us to do this pre- pod because otherwise it's going look terrible for the next 30 seconds oh so 17 players before you get to stran Larson and then another seven 24 players yeah so we insane before you get to kuna as as the most projected goals this weekend it's pretty close you know we're all going to say there's that many but realistically you've got you know esack at 044 who's what eight from the list down to Kun at 37 so it's it's pretty it's pretty minimal in terms of what we're seeing there but it's not like so home to Southampton yeah this is the fixture like Danny Welbeck home to man city is predicted to get more goals the Matas Kya that's doesn't sit right with me lad it doesn't doesn't sit right on me at all like look at it this week I'm like okay who's the highest projected of the sub 6.5s oh it's Chris Wood again of course it is it's Chris Wood again it's a good fixture for him as well obviously home old Club old Club old Club where you didn't have a great time you want to put all those narratives in there yeah so so so so help me out boys because neither have you got DCL have you no thank God don't pick don't pick bad players from Bad teams mate I do the honest list you've got dman Neil mate and he's he's not even okay fine yeah okay Carry On I don't think Championship Defenders oh yeah got I don't oh yeah got the other one shooting yourself in the foot mate we're all stupid in this game yeah um uh but DCL was there and I so if there's a doubt on Partner then I feel like I have to move on DCL because Rogers is there as as as an option but if if if not then I don't know if I'll get 11 players out so I feel like probably should just make the move on DCL as my move the more I think about it is probably that's where I should make it and you look at it this week and you say well I've got the money hiland's right there 0.51 did you just attack it with the threee fixtures but you know he hasn't got pens you know he's probably also limited on minutes um you know wood is right there I almost feel like you know you get you'll make this own narrative in your head though because chriswood has done so well that would almost Sade me not to go there it's this thing I always do it's not the right thing at all yeah it really does so the new shiny Ty Highland might be the one yeah because you're like I've got to try because I'm like I don't even know why I'm two and a half million now whatever it is then then I'm like well I've got to try and get past the people that I've got wood so I need to get get get somebody else exactly what do you need to do in 12 well what would you do in 12 if you were to get chriswood oh I I suspected just son sacka sunant saaka yeah probably just would you bench wood against Arsenal yeah yeah yeah because Rogers H to Palace okay so then because that is the interesting thing with wood is is about it is that there's a slight headache if I went oand of like who do I play next week well we don't even know if hland starts next week Nam room comes in right no cuz you know talking brand new manager so because as much as much as it is like just get Chris Wood Wood because it's an easy bench to week and then and then again week 13 I get that get the home to it switch yeah I mean I was going to say whis but probably like the fixtures are pretty much the same cuz brenford are so crap away from home it probably doesn't really matter and again 13 is obviously the big Leicester home fixture but do I just try and ruin Chris Wood for everybody so there's another player that we were SP speaking about a small bit in the group chat that is jedro um I know Adam you brought him up as well would you be more than happy to wait until next week go for a Jo Pedro even though you know it's a small bit of risk rather than going to a wood it's just I still don't know whether Jia Pedro is better than Danny Welbeck still I don't think we know that anymore yeah actually Dani W's been so good that I just ru has been good as well I mean I know he's gonna bring he's probably gonna bring him straight back in but rout has been pretty good as well he been pretty good so it doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like he has to throw him straight in and you're right it's the game week 13 is the one against Southampton at home if you're G to bring him in that week and then then I mean there's Evan nson down at down at Bournemouth I like it but I don't like it enough I don't love it maybe I should just get Chris bloody wood I mean it might it might just it might just solve your it might just solve your problems so you don't have to think about it I mean as you say you can bench him next week bench him against City and then I mean the fixtures aren't good though like Forest fixtures are objectively bad over the next 10 when you've not got Harland you've got eight you've got eight decent players this is true Rogers fixtures are getting better again now you know is is um maybe I need to look at the rotations around Rogers and wood but when you've got I've got bumo Salah Palmer and it be Sack or son you're playing those every week um salanki and Kaa I'm playing them every week at the moment there's no chance of the picture even even the man city game I'll play sank all day long in that game small bit off topic but when do you see yourself getting rid of emo or do you well it's crazy price now like it is a crazy price but I am I I honestly did look at it and was like is Bruno is Bruno for Brian like the world's worst option for next three they've got two home games brenford got two home games there's just too much there potentially yeah the EO I well just not not even just not even just the EO I just think there I just think they'll create enough big chances in the next two games in the next two out of the next three games I just don't think that like Boomer will get a couple of those chances right and Bruno won't get those he will be provide he'll be more on the creative side just trust boo just trust I think game week 14 I think it's a it's it's a definite consideration option it's just trying to figure out who the best person at that fixture when those fixtures get to 14 like yeah what do you what do you do from there I mean well by then foden might be cheaper than than bumo so maybe Le Highway swap you look down at the fixtures in 14 and there are just loads and loads of real crap to be honest yeah it's difficult I mean you could do to Palmer or something like that and maybe just get let's do our guest team let's do the guest team you can teams we need do teams and get out we're almost at an hour so that's good um Mr chai I have now changed your name I don't know whether you saw it it said har I'm not Harry no more no no no um Team you want me to run true for the podcast please mate yeah that'd be great so on goal we've got ederson H treb Lewis Alexander Arnold eight Nori h four in Midfield Muhammad Salah in buo garnacho and Palmer three up top salanki kuna and HTS it's not in this image but currently the Iron Band is on Dominic sanki and of course Rogers mikeno and Greaves on the bench when you sent me the image did it have salanki Captain I can't remember so that's on me if so that's on me good so I have 1 million uh or I have one free transfer 1.8 in a million similar space to you Baker um originally at the start of the week uh I I spoke on stream quite a bit on last week potentially doing uh isach for hits and this week I also like that move of course they play first and I think Newcastle look a bit sharper than we've seen um in those first six seven games and Gordon is back playing well so he's definitely W us on my mind another one is is um upgrading Lewis of course of ederson on goal just don't know how much of fancy going into the common game weeks were player that I don't know if he's going to start or not and I just don't fancy playing m mikeno every week like we spoke about other than that eight home fixtures looks absolutely brilliant yeah it's funny is it I look at a similar thing I think all of us look at it goes L of home pictures this week but we just looked at the we just looked at the odds a minute ago and it's not great like because of week but as soon as you see a lot of homes you're like well I'm in for a good week here I got these homes um so do you think you move habits out I really don't know um don't feel like we've got anything solid on on habits um I don't even think he was on the the gold the goal list a second ago that we just looked at so I feel inclined s and off that list I feel inclined to move them on but then again I look at fixture next week um and the week after it only gets better for Arsenal I can't see this this dip in form to continue so and I will eventually want the point a piece of that Arsenal attack so how I get there is a question for me fair enough what about would you consider benchin HS and looking at someone even for say bodgers like you could get Brennan don't do that to me don't be doing that to me I'm actually not considered that he's so good at this he's so good at this like seriously every week he's like you consider this I'm like oh hold on gacho you got G already that is spicy because then I go into the game week and you know my team is fairly differential in general I would say you know I don't think too many have the double up on a Nori kuna unless you of course brought in Salah like everyone else um but I had a really strong attack in slanky hland and haris of course I only moved out of but now I've got garnacho with a really nice lesser home and especially if I go from Rogers that would really differentiate the team you have me thinking I don't know though hav if he does play against his old team something nice about it he scored two last time he played him 74 minutes against him yeah he want to be fit looks good and if the fact that OD came off the bench sh mod starts big game they need it sh mode starts which means that you'd hope really I mean I say hope like like fre Tottenham fans here hope that that that trossard would drop out and that OD would go in and that means that have Earth is back at nine as well and it was a cut so you think he's going to be fine couple of stitches or whatever wasn't it yeah yeah yeah be fine or I could just roll I could I'm in a place where like if I roll no problem um I could easily make a transfer no problem like uh I don't think I need to be too worried about it um like on paper it is good what do you do if what do you do if there's news that Palmer's at then I would definitely be more inclined to make Rogers a sixo someone midfielder that that gets interesting then how much has he moved in price now for everyone I haven't even looked you know you stick him in at five and then I've never looked at him since who yeah like well when when do you want him back and that's like in few weeks time unless you do something wild like find a route to Watkins for example yeah it's whatever you do want in back when it's because because it if you're not if you're going to stay without Harland for a long time then you might decide you do want more in mfield with a five um but yeah I don't know what I'd get for Rogers let me have a let me have a quick look on that one I can stretch to 7 million if I take get 5.2 Rogers yeah 5.2 so I B five it's 5.4 now yeah 5.2 do you know who I'd love if I could do it if I could do this move I would do it a hary and this uh Gordon 7.2 on point2 off I I think Gordon isn't being spoke about rightly so because he got an injury recently but I think he's definitely an interesting one and he'll be back in conversation soon and obviously the the the spicy move would be if you did take some money out of havers then a minus four get Rogers up to Bruno oh we're looking at that now imagine that like double United defense it sounds great yeah it's there it's there let's see I'll need to Tamper a small bit more yeah fair enough let's and I don't always say fair enough when I disagree clearly up to you also fair enough we just want to move on that's yeah I have many uses for it I have many uses your teammate so I also have one free transfer 1.8 in the bank which is probably like a standard amount if you took Harland out last week um uh yeah decision in goal fabianski or Ry cently got fabianski in there leis a nor and Gabrielle of the defense son uh boomo Palmer Salah Rogers is my current team with Salah with the AR as it stands um K and salanki up top and at the moment I've got DCL first bench M go second and Greaves last sh gavves hopefully will be back after International break I I think it makes you more Twitchy when you've only got the four Defenders and you got that last one you're like oh God how how much am I potentially going to get into that last one despite the fact that my Defenders get one point every week so I'm not sure what that bothered about it especially Eno your fourth Defender yeah I don't trust I just don't trust C lean enough to start I just think bet done enough um so unless D I mean d was D pretty much gave it away last week and they he talked about Betto still needs to do a lot of work to get into being a starting player so hopefully he might get AR something similar because if he is starting obviously well I don't know what I'm saying it because I'm plan the blood West Dam keeper I shouldn't really say it was a good fixture but westan does feel like a good fixture um so and it sounds like mcneel might be struggling as well whicho think is pretty good for everon um so I suspect I take Cal L out and I'm starting to come around to the idea that maybe I should stop trying to be too clever with it and just get Chris wood bench Rogers um I do think though if I Chris would in my team would I always struggle to bench him remember again because he's a penalty taken at a number nine probably the same it's probably I'll probably face into the same pain that I had when I was like Cal Len where it was like I want to play him every week because he's number nine on pens um but at least chriswood scores Fair Point yeah okay I need to what I need to do is have probably more a look at the fixtures and rotations around Rogers and DCR because with the other guys I just don't see myself I'm going to bench him just don't see it okay so that's me and then up to me you see Rogers firmly planted on my bench um right at the back right at the back yeah I'm ready to get hurt there again so I've got Johnston in goal at the moment who won't play but it's Southampton at home so if he does play it's a great fixture Trent Gabrielle porro at the back um Matas Nunes Brian son and mcneel don't love that having too many that I'm not particularly comfortable with and then salanki Harland Anda up top Captain C is currently on sun uh Emmy Martinez Lewis Davis and Rogers on the bench it is a bit awkward having you say McNeil and mat Nunes there um and it feels like if there's an opportunity to take money out I've only got 09 in the bank so there's not really many options for me to to upgrade and to maybe take some pressure off that Midfield I maybe would play Lewis or do I just play Rogers it probably doesn't matter I should probably just play Rogers actually In fairness um which is probably actually what I need to do is probably play Rogers over the one that I'm not sure about I'm not sure I'm going to be making any transfers this week I don't again see a huge amount of upside and going anywhere near any more Liverpool this week yes it's a home game um that's also Al why Rogers is on my bench because I got Trent in defense obviously that McNeil to garnacho uh McNeil to garnacho option yeah potentially yeah so this is this is the source was Joe Thomas who said that briman Neils a doubt for Everton's trip to Western this weekend it was set to undergo a final assessment on Friday so hopefully some news there it's an away game as well and so good chance they might get some traveling news um and we're a late deadine as well yeah knee injury which hampered his preparations ahead of the game versus Southampton last weekend has since flared upir flare up doesn't sound flare up doesn't sound too bad Adam ice pack where do you stand uh with Tren it's not one that a lot of people are speaking about I think a lot of people that owner are more than happy to hold them do you want more are you happy to how he's done so far uh I'm fine with what he's done so far just but I don't think he's worth the money that I've paid for him or got in him at all so would you would you be looking going forward to get rid of him yeah that's basically what I'm trying yeah but the problem the problem is is I want to get rid of Trent I want to get rid of porro I want to get rid of Nunes mcneel uh and Lewis and then I kind of want to do a Hokey Koke on Rogers and get rid of Harland so it's it's it's kind of difficult when you've only got one free transfer to make seven so I've got to try and pick my battles I mean Trent going to be the one that's going to free out the most money uh well no obviously Harland will but Trent front yeah but um I mean Trent fre is up three million not three million well yeah maybe three million two and a half million immediately anyway so it just feels really odd going down to canate I just it just feels like a really weird move I think if you haven't got canate I think if you haven't got canate and you're looking for that that sort of price bracket mid Defender I think it's a pretty fine move but when you've already got Trent and you're it's going to go canate it just feels a bit weird um so it might be the one though because it's it's 1.7 million you know that gives me enough to take you know McNeil to Bruno for example I mean honestly the way I see canate versus Tren at the moment is canate has an opportunity to score on on every corner that Liverpool get but but Trent has the only has the ability to return on half of them you know is is is can's in the Box for every single one of them but Trent's only taking one side like like it and you get double the points if you score them now obviously van dyk's there as well blah blah blah blah but doesn't mean it's can score them all but I don't think it's a huge loss at the moment to have canate I really don't um and I would spend less time thinking about that move and more time thinking about the yes if I you offered me for example if you offered me son and Tren or you offered me Salah and canate then probably go oh sorry yeah I said get son and Trent or Sal and canate I have son canate forward not this weekend I mean if you yeah that that's I think that's fair enough in isolation I think looking at the rest of the team I don't think it's it's not doesn't feel like a problem area no no no but the only way you're going to address the fact that you've got three five million pound midfielders really is to sell the big guy yeah yeah you can't you can't really and he I mean he has to go by he has to go in 12 like whatever really so yeah so whatever happens he has to go in 12 and do I think it's you know because 12 can be 12 versus Tottenham oh yeah yeah he's gone for that he's gone for that yeah R going to put him on his ass it's fine the question the question does come back on these ones is can you do it C can you do it with free transfers or do you just do it with hit I probably need a hit either way like I probably need a hit I don't mind a hit yeah but if I do it this week I probably take four points and then I take probably another four points next week I probably take eight anyway if you looked at this week and said sort of expected points on say Harland and one of the midfielders that you don't want either McNeil or Nunes um who would you bring in this week if you were to switch that around Salah and which Striker that's the thing like the the problem with the strikers this week is that all the strikers feel like I'd want to get off them again very quickly whereas I think next week I can look at I can see about xia Pedro Welbeck I can I guess I'm one fixture further away from a good Chris Wood fixture and I'm one fixture further away from wiissa um and I'm one fixture further away from say stran Larson so there're the difficult ones so maybe it is this week maybe is maybe it is gambling on the fact that that I don't I don't know in Brighton next week I don't know that we gain anything from Brighton versus Man City that gives us info to know which is the best Brighton stroker for the better games no that's that's that's yeah that's also well I mean at least P J Pedro playing would might be a might be an indicator oh yeah that's definitely that might help that's definitely a bonus um but yeah I think I think I think it does look inevitable that you are going to have to take the plunge probably on Holland with 35 million Powerman fielders um and Palmer and Salah with pretty decent pixture BS Yeah Yeahs how much money can I get down from har I mean I can't if I take harand like Matas is only 49 so it's really difficult to get very far up there um well yeah you can still switch harand Holland mat for example is still still cheaper than Salo and any Striker under 7 million yes then I can't do anything with McNeil I'd like to almost do two but can I how many CH yeah I I know I know then because then then I'm taking out Trent at that point as well and then when you know then then it gets to like I don't know 1: a.m. on Saturday morning then I'm bringing in knows who like who who knows at that point yeah Palmer and 12 is going to be the one isn't it even if you sell this week it would be what do I do what do I do to get Palmer and 12 yeah where if you roll you can work it out well it mean getting getting getting Palmer and 12 would involve like Trent and Sun well not if you don't go Salah not if I don't go Salah so if I went Bruno then so like I think in 12 for example like I think Watkins I think Watkins starts to get better again come come past 12 yeah yeah absolutely Z Watkins say again isach or Watkins I think isach and Watkins get better but but but I like I like Watkins post the international break I look at it I think the home Palace game's good game um so yeah potentially likes what Harland and Nunes becomes Watkins and Palmer for free and then works all around a bit Palmer can cover a lot of the salic Caps he can't they've actually got they've actually you got there's going to be decisions to make when there's games like 12 is a decision to make on Palmer versus Salah it's a big old decision Southampton or Leicester we can we can leave that convers we can leave that conversation for a few weeks we can leave that conversation for a few weeks so um thank you to everyone in the chat make sure youve hit the like button uh before you leave today uh there's questions any questions not really any questions what are your thoughts on Lewis versus vardal tempted to make the move between the two the sideways that's a luxury move I suppose sounds very luxury not sure I'd be making that no I'm not sure i' be making it um I don't like the fixtures I don't like the I don't like the clean I think V's been an incredible pck and I think he'll still continue to be like like if you think that you're going to have viio as a long-term hold to 38 then I think it's okay yeah um but I look at it and think the next four or five weeks I don't really think I want viio like I'd rather take the chance on someone like d like you said we'll get CA back is CA back on the menu soon Ben White maybe something something like that maybe that might come up um Chelsea winning 8 nil apparently Christoper and kungu back on the score sheet two for Felix as well it's good because they don't I mean they don't play at the weekends so um Colin Johnson says remember guys Saints only considered one goal at City when everyone was talking about triple Captain harand wolves might be a tight game I'd imagine Southampton approached that game a little bit differently I would assume so to as well I think Southampton will still get to play though like like Southampton we have seen when they've gone out and play they like they can move the ball and I think what we saw in that Palace walls game last week was both teams were just trying to move the ball ball so I do think they'd be goals yeah I think it will be will be pretty different um and how they are I've just noticed in game week 12 that Palmer's the first game of the game week at half1 12 you know you know the f is saying don't say everybody's going to C in Salah because he's on Sunday just wait don't tell anyone everybody is gonna Captain Salah because he's on Sunday would you play Rogers this week or Smith row didn't even talk about Fulham I mean but yeah we didn't talk about Monday nights game at all um who F got Palace exactly uh don't like but that's for me I suppose Phil are making some decent chances what if what if Harry Wilson scores a braak and then just starts ahead of him this weekend though that's actually a good point did just score a Brak like he could easily just walk in and take that place um yeah it's probably still my thr just yeah I probably play Smith row uh Madison to Bruno yeah yeah absolutely absolutely in a hobby uh Ryan Football chat box says hello last couple of questions hello to you Ryan um question for chai how long do you intend to keep G atro for and what's your favorite type of tea okay so this is actually a brilliant question um how long am I going to hold G atual for I think it really depends on what we see from amaron when he comes in I mean the obvious answer for me is 14 because they play against Arsenal but again it really depends on the situation if suddenly United are are drawing against leester and nips wi I think I could bin them off and ever if it comes to it um in terms of my favorite tea mint tea is my favorite and the reason is um is because it balances your hormones there you go very good never get you never get you never get positive Health stuff on here other than your life helps there you go there you go if it helps my two favorite tees are mint and chai so perfect there you go the both last question from Sally uh well okay well I'll do the Adams as well because he's shares the same name as me so that would be terrible if I did not include him um Sally says Captain Salah on or salanki I mean that's literally what we're talking about it's literally all three of us so so let's let's talk it I'm currently on Mo CH you're currently on salanki that's right and I'm currently on currently on son yeah there you go perfect so we're completely split good luck would you play whist or seeno a wher I'd play seeno oh you play seeno over whis yeah okay I'm not sure I don't agree with that I just bford at home isn't it brenford at home for me I play wi okay we're two1 there no worri Sally you just got here you can rewind and watch everything if you want but that's fine because we's plan against fleen though sorry s's plan about planning against fleen I mean he was excellent for 91 and a half minutes was he on Monday when when you ruined his clean she CH did you see that did you see the I did but did you see the did you see the messages that Baker was we were talking on WhatsApp oh okay so Adam's the dark side in in our world in this one in the I was saying I don't really mind the Fleck and clean sheet because Jimenez would gone off whist had gone off Smith row had gone off I was like as long as they all blank I don't really mind I don't mind the Fleck and clean sheet that's sort of offset by boom get his fre points he'll be fine I was fine about that Adam's like no I want I want I want Misery all round absolutely he's on three he's on three bonus he was like three save points I was like he's going to lose his clean and lose all his bonus I want minus seven points off flecken please as as they kept doing those P roller shots at fleen I was getting annoyed about it myself because I was just like you're just giving him save points what are you doing for it so I was like I said something like let them dream get the wipe out in 0 in the 92nd minute and I said that with like 25 minutes to go 25 minutes a half an hour to go and and it happened bang on 9 thanks very much the first thing I looked at no joke the first thing I looked at was not my phone when the goal went in the first thing I looked at was the time it was instantly because knew were in injury time so the goal goes in I look at the time 9130 and I'm like this is amazing just text Baker started doing it and they people started showing screenshots of their 12 pointers and all that stuff and then best thing ever when it dropped to when it dropped to like seven points whatever I was like ah still okay though is it and then four you were like it's funny I mean that that was the worst thing about the the worst thing about the uh the the winner was obviously obviously he loses he goes down and loses all of his bonus in that moment because he was still top bonus after conceding the first one so he lost all his bonus annoyed the fact that he had the bonus yeah well it's just man just volume of saves and stuff wasn't it but the fact that he lost the bonus looked amazing until and he's like he was like 20% owned and then until you realize that Robinson got the assist and he was like 25% owned so like the three points just went the other way I cannot believe how high the ownerships were in that Monday night game throwing like a third of teams we haven't had a good Monday Night Football in a while actually now you say that ah the game we play the game we play The Game's gone chai thank you very much for joining us um cheers boys for having me on been a pleasure it has it has full spurs by us this week we do enjoy that we've got um I think we're trying to get

Break um and and yeah make sure on the way out 225 of you thank you for being here hit the like button on the way out hit subscribe if you haven't done so already and we will see you again Sunday cheers guys come on you Spurs cheers [Music]",14657,me right guys welcome back this is the above average fpl podcast my names adam im always joined by baker and this evening we got chai how you doing chai you right all good adam thank you for having me on cheers boys quite often listen to the show and im here to share the most biased spurs opinions youve had so far sounds good thats what we thats what were all about were all about spurs the main man on the the main man on the thumbnail and big week for us fixture wise and weve just watched us play galatasaray with which is slightly awkward it didnt feel ideal but firstly before we go well touch on that but how are you doing bakeer you right good mate all good its im on co palmer watch which is a weird one for me because ive also got double arsenal defense like i want palmer to play and i see want him and i want him to beat arsenal as well to be fair but im like also if he doesnt play do that make me better or worse im not even sure but yes fairly big weekend fairly big captaincy choice yes and an opportunity to talk tottenham and to be fair like we are pure spurs bias and dont have the great historical ranks and so forth but last season so t where did you finish last season 1 1839 of course that was a season that created fpl ch but we spent like i want to say like 30 game weeks in the top 100 were fluctuating from second to 10th for a few weeks and just shared a journey had a bit of buzz did you did you think you did you think you had a chance to win it i genuinely from the bottom of my heart everything was going in my way i genuinely thought i was gonna win it all but come game week i think 30ish flop the wild card i was like ah maybe its not my season you do need that bit of luck in the in the running to make it to make it happen and i know we spoke to jamie when he won it and i think it was like gw 34 he did a couple of things that just looked a bit strange but he brought like kdb in and then capped him in 36 when he got the massive 60 pointer for him and and that rocketed him and then never looked back from there so you do need you do need things in those final weeks to go your way you need to be a sub optimal manager im not going to lie thats why i got quite a bit of criticism i can completely understand im doing things that normal people wouldnt do and its working out its just a bit of luck and timing as well and it be calculating a small bit of your look but you have to roll the dice to have a chance when you up there did you feel like you did at some point you realized that you were taking a lot of risks and got there and then when you were like could i win did you take more risks or did you did you change anything during because a lot of eyes were on you suddenly for being where you were for that did you feel like that changed one how you felt about like how you played and two like what was the pressure like and did you even enjoy it i genuinely think thats what made it enjoyable was the fact that i could do whatever i wanted and for some reason it would work at the time like i genuinely felt like a madman like it was so weird its like it revolved around me no matter what i done like esally pascal gross like that was his breakout season for brighton i want to say he was phenomenal he was coming up with everything but little things throughout the season every single week were just slowly gravitating towards me in terms of how enjoyable it was i would say like the initial stage i get my twitter account rolling start making a youtube channel its all very exciting you get to speak like to people all over the world and people like ye start popping up that part is enjoyable but then it gets to a point where its like ah there all always a on you and things stop going your way which is normal you expect that and then you feel a bit more pressure and a small bit anxious on a weekly basis so good to be grounded this season im currently sat at 15m but i enjoy the season just as much as any other and im looking forward to see if we can top it thats what thats what we need thats what were waiting for were waiting for that one breakout season where we can go right were in the top 100 and then and then we just get a ton of followers from all from all of that were trying to thats what were waiting for we waiting for it for a while i dont know whether its ever going to come but might be a while it might be it might be a while especially if i for me anyway if i keep doing things like bringing in matas nunes in a week where i probably should be bringing in salah wow but that is so captain spurs all captain spurs i think i think thats it theres theres theres so many different people are on so many different paths at the moment youve got people who are sitting on harland wondering what to do without salah youve got people sitt on salah bind harland well they have well they have both you got some people that are sitting there with a wild card coming up in a weeks time as well theres a theres a big fixture swing about to happen for a number of teams there quite a lot i think theres a lot of focus on like what our teams are going to be for game week 11 but i think a lot of what the decisions that you make other than if youre wild carding i think revolve on what youre going to do from 12 onwards funny enough so as much as we look at the fixtures this weekend and spurs is the fixture that everyones looking at for obvious reasons and i forgot to put in the slide about the was it the huddle graphic showing like the xg plot i forgot that ill put it in at some point when you guys are talking but so there is a definite mismatch theres its its pretty obvious itp switch its tot switch it switch away from home this season like its quite a step change theyve had some hard fixtures but 16 xg theyve conceded away from home the most goals conceded with 13 its its quite comfortably as well i think leicester and next are like 14 and then southampton at 12 like its its big the other stuff is when you look at their away stats as well with whips which they havent pressed at all away from home theyve sat back and youre like i dont know how thats going to the best way to get a to the moment is to press them high themselves and try and turn the ball over but theyve theyve allowed teams to press them highly is again it all just looks like a delicious fixture and we are a home team like we are having big issues away from home continually it feels like teams have worked us out a little and are able to try and exploit that at home for some reason when they come to the big stadium is broken should be back up now were brok im not broke well get a comment in chat saying were lagging but then it will come straight back amazing so it felt like some i said he put some put some runs in but realistically like it felt like it would just didnt want to be there and im like i dont know how many minutes were going to get out some on the weekend cut out again no just trying to pick it up now are we back you should be back should be back how many minutes so was a qui so chai you challenged us there go on how many minutes are we saying im going to say 70 75 for me adam i think 75 is fine and i think thats enough i think thats enough cu i think game should be done and dusted by then if theres anything that we know about spurs is the first 15 to 20 minutes that second half is where things can happen and if hes on the pitch for the first half then great so i think that works fine for me i think what we have seen from ag is the substitutions a little bit pain by numbers a little bit in some of the some of the some of the minutes for example so it definitely feels like he trusts the sport science said guys so if they say sun 75 if were if its nil itll still take him off on 75 if its 5 nil itll take it off from 75 what its not like sometimes substitutions or the minutes that we see every weekend are a lot game state related for example if theyre not winning harlands always playing 0 is if its three or four goals in the back well thats probably the time where he gets the rest so i dont think suns one of those where its like 75 minutes if he comes off in 75 minutes its because hes done all the damage and if they hadnt done the damage yet hell play to the end i dont think that is the case with i think like we saw last week with the villa game like he looked like he was about to explode in that game and then just get saing off because and just like no thats the minutes i think especially when you consider the setback hes after foret theyre trying to put a cotton blanket around him now especially so id be more than happy with subing them off regardless of the game state like you said hopefully see mikey moore get 15 20 minutes i love that virus you just be he just be resting up bit of oofin warm blanket and itll be fine by the weekend youd assume wouldnt you unless hes got like angela fever type thing it sounded like well phil ability for it so we think that minutes rons out so sanki minutes solid youd think night minutes for salanki wouldnt you i would say so i think thats why i would lean towards the sank captaincy im sure well get onto it over sunny i dont know if you had son do you have son one and if you had son and you had the pair who would you be more likely to show the ar so me and adam have got both got slank and son okay full bias warriors youve got have you got both ive got salanki you got salanki but not son i am im in same position i would captain sank over some this weekend i think my battle is salanki v salah not s v salah this weekend i would agree with that 100 fair enough what about you i dont know i think i prefer i think i prefer son i just think i adam by the way if adam says fair enough it means he what he means is i dont agree a little bit i dont know why he says fa off tell us what you mean tell us tell us well i know that you a week ago said to me that you wouldnt triple captain harland over salah because the midfielders are so good and they telling me that you want to go for the striker over in spurs instead of the midfielder so im not im not because im currently on sal because i still think the midfielders are the options for it but there is the question in the chat if what if you had salanki and brennan noank i think for me what edges it is especially now that im ejected in my own mind 70 minutes for sun let say slank is on penalties for 20 25 minutes if in that case and we dont get many penalties not to say one as you but somewhere in my mind im like thats more appetizing than captain and sun for me we dont get any penalties because we dont because we dont have the profile of winger thats going to drive into the box and take people on we have the profile of winger thats going to cross early and the other winger is just going to be standing on the six yard line so either get he might get fouled but not many not many defenders make rash challenges in that area of the pitch normally the winger just taps it in so the pens thing im not sure i put any weight on it for spurs personally thats valid we dont get any like exactly as you said oogi and brenan both of them they make the they make the runs the driving runs that go past everybody else and they tend to just hit it first time they tend to just drive it across first time that said i did watch i did watch salah absolutely rinse leaf davis i know that was a while ago now but like defensively leaf davis is not going to be hes not going to be up to brennans pace so it could be a week where he does well might back might just back it as an anytime goal score and just leave it at that the out ofed the hell out of it you cant lose then exactly i just i wouldnt c brandon over the others i think its i think its unpredictable what well see from him i definitely think hell have hell definitely have a big chance thats what you definitely almost know where brenon is he finds ways to have a big chance youd expect that against i witch as well but even if he seems to have a big chance its very rare that brennan also gets top bonus as well because he works in limited touches like his is his thing is not to pass the ball around his thing is not to even cross the ball very often his thing is to just arrive in the right place and tap the ball in del ali sty its the old school like type baseline as well like six or seven like its just its never its its so unlikely to be enough compared to what were seeing from the m suns creativity at the moment thats that is the best thing about with sun is that youve got huge amount of cre creativity i think the thing with son that i worry about is its almost too cre like that hes much more disciplined than brenan in terms of he will stay on his wing absolutely i think especially this season i dont know why its quite interesting to watch because hes so relaxed and he mightnt be in the game for periods of the game and suddenly hell do something like we were used to seeing like wow hes still there at 32 or whatever i think hes 32 do you still think hes got it do you think hes at you think hes past the peak of his paris i think he knows his game more i think it is that bit that weve seen it with like those mature guys were seeing it with leowski at barcelona now in that sense of those guys dont lose it they just know their games more and i think he knows this game more is if they want to offer width hes just unlikely to beat people with 20 30 yard runs so he just holds his position more than anything else hes creating space for others and his creativity like his creativity is just get better and better the cross last week for the brennan go was fantastic i dont i dont hate the sunat i dont but i dom would edge it for me at the moment in terms of from the spurs guys and i just dont know if i like those more than i like liverpool fair enough i think i did manage to put this together just in time just to just to show that xg difference city top of that with about plus one plus 95 something like that spurs in second at about seven something like that and then i switch down at minus 11 and thats its its quite clear and as much as you saw i wouldnt take todays game against galatasaray as a yard stick for how te well realistically how were going to defend however we are possibly going to be missing our two center backs on on the weekend like you were you were talking about porro bringing in por po this week baker like how is it is it today thats maybe called that slightly well i think i think romero is going to be okay i would not be surprised at all if romero plays and id be surprised if madison plays so we are we are looking at par set pieces we have ip switch are without greaves like its their best header im just trying to work out who would win who would win headers for us just dom somehow ben davies wins so more h than any man ive ever seen he misses them all but like somehow he seems to always win the header thats there dragon can win a header romer and dom can but i do expect for at least 70 minutes of the game that par set pieces no thats fair which does tempt me whereever you want to use a transfer again still on defenders at the moment defenders are just so painful of whether id want to use one there and youre using youre bringing a guy in that youre almost certainly just going to bench next week against m city i me ive got 18 and a half million in my starting defenders at the moment its painful its painful when i have 13 and a half it be i feel a lot more comfortable exactly im not im not ruling out that if i looked at still what parro versus say dow because i think theyre probably the two there like dow canate and parro all very similar prices that five to five and a half million i look at them i think i like him i love that al one i was going to bring him up especially when this new maner comes in he plays five the back and i think under 10 hag weve seen dow play so advanced itll always tend to keep clean sheets throughout the season i dont know how they do it doesnt matter how good or bad they are theyll always keep some clean sheets and of course the favorable fixtures h coming up so i do like that one if theres a if theres a if theres an entry point its these two games right its it is these two games absolutely for sure and i think theres even theres even opportunity to have him as a make play for or maybe not dow but if youre looking to get into the midfield theres possibilities to get into get in and out of manual assets just for a couple of games and theres people talking about hland as well which is fair again im looking for me harry just in the chat doesnt sun take some set pieces weird so sun looks like direct free i imagine direct free kicks is probably going to be sun over por probably if madisons not on the pitch game before last i did not notic that i think it was when madison went off the pitch that sun did take some corners but last game that was straight back to parro now maybe you might say it was well he had tight hamstrings and whatever therefore he didnt get him to take the set pieces but it looked like they just gone back it did look like porro was only taking them from the left side wasnt he it was mainly kosi was out on the right one orbe they always did that short corner to parro they love that dont they love it love it they love it so i think the majority of the stuff will still be through par should we get the fixtures up we can look at the fixtures first of all got say hello to everyone in the youtube chat so shout out to you guys for joining us and watching us maybe youve just got us in the background white or youve got us in the foreground and youve got man united in the background thats what were hoping thats what were assuming you dont need to listen to the commentary you can listen to us thats cool so shout out to you and as always shout out to crypto blown for his support for the podcast we appreciate it weve got a couple of weeks to go until the fca so for anybody that did vote for us thanks for that looking forward to that you you tried your suit on today didnt you baker i tried i am a man thats been working at home for the last eight years and when i do go to the office its a very modern type office you wear chinos polo shirt that type of world i havent put a suit on for yes at least i reckon i reckon its at least 8 i was trying to what play back through in my head somehow got a wider back how do you get a wider back as you get older i dont even know thats possible cuz i could get my trails up but i was like my god im have to go suit shopping this weekend im have to do it this week because the was away next weekend amazing we can we can sure look at fixtures but while were looking at fixtures people have got to make sure they hit that like button if they enjoy what theyre watching sl listening to and and make sure you subscribe if you want to see more from us heading towards 9k subs want to get to 10k im hoping were arranging like a decent sized giveaway for 10k so we just pop that in there as a little cherry so make sure you subed because its going to be for anyone thats subbed there might be some other teas and sees around that but it will be for subscribers and we have as you we have to grind it cuz we aint going to get there by being number two in the world mr chai no well get there dont worry twice a week begging no were not begging but lets look at some lets look at some games so as always we look at the data that comes from rob t the data that comes from spreadex and were looking at expected goals in a particular matchup as well as a percentage chance of a clean sheet big ticket items spurs weve spoken about and with the highest percentage chance of a clean sheet this week 38 and then were looking at united at home to leicester 245 with a 36 chance of a clean sheet so like second and then youre looking at liverpool third with 235 and 32 chance of a clean sheet once again like not many games where were expecting to see cleans and theres lots of one ors and two ons hanging around all over the place wherever you go no 40 whatsoever none like 40 so are like yes over 40 you can start thinking theres a good chance of it none 38 in spurs might as well be 20 to be honest thats what its bad like when we are nearly topping it like liable defense this weekend what youre in some trouble so let me pos some questions to you lets go to the defense lets do the defense stuff r leis if you got him have we all got him ive got him y do you play him not at the moment you got about 12 so you got you got some options ill ill sit back you been leaf davis last week so i cant start mikeno over lewis the upside of lewis is just too high for me to not start where is this upside we keep i keep talking about it but he youre going to score goals he stands in the box a lot right thats thats the big upside isnt it he never nobody ever passes to him but like he stands in the box a lot hes just there hes like a poor mans mos know what like at least mos got the assist last week but thats guy where they just theyre always around but theyre not doing and touching the ball in the right spaces is but you look at this and im like im in similar position where its mikeno is the option if i was to not play him but its whever he gets in the team thats the big question like for me i have no doubt west have im going to score against everton i dont know why its just one of these fixtures where can see goals when i we look at it that way like im not too high on ever and clean sheet its like why wouldnt i start rico lewis even if im worried about his minut i dont know i dont know do you think hell start im 5050 and i think that 50 is hope for i think it start i think it start cu walker was just so bad he i just think in a way though the worst part about them even just midweek was that we keep talking about it the midfield dont track like they do need him to invert a bit more and provide some legs into that midfield because id much rather they were playing three big center backs and then rico was inverting but theyre not doing that much because vardal is clearing off its not like what like its not like when you think about like last season with trent where he sort came in midfield and robertson stayed back as that left center back but the problem is vards so high then you stick rico lewis up there and youre like i just i dont know to be fair whoever its going to be is going to get pinned back because matoma is just going to have whoever it is just you chasing the tail like against porro similar game against trent last week honestly as i said i if canart got injured im sure trent was coming off at our time because he was just mat was just taking the piss ats class hes been class this season as well i thought he so impressive against us he randa shock hes already made an absolute mockery of por and trend this season and i look up against rico ls and im like and know that if hes on the bench hes going to come on 100 so is it is it upside versus meleno i dont know i dont i dont think that i dont think the city will clean this week so im comfortable in benching him for whoever i think well yours isnt forever though whos your other free defenders well my other free defenders are gabrielle porro and trent well yours is not in the conversation youre going to ben im very comfortable b get this all over twinter tw im benching leis this week youre like who is it well ive got probably the best free defenders anyone could got the best fre defenders anyone could have this week okay wa he just said v was not keeping it clean so you true i have got the best three this is true its true ill be we youre not in youre not in the game of mikeno wait i was im never ever im never ever going to be in that game i dont dont get involved with championship defenders you got leaf davis mate i know i know but i dont play him thats true he just there as well for celebrations i know its a bit of a left field swerve but matias has dropped us a super chat so lets just get a big just a quick quick answer for him so he said weve spoken about spurs and weve spoken about united already briefly so pick two out of son salang holand and bruno you want to go first baker whos he asking this to i dont know i dont know whether he can have two mids two strikers do you want one of each well ill just something than you thanks thats i think i go i think i go i think son and salanki i cant i cant say bruno and salanki if im going to captain son over salanki can i thats like just makes no sense whatsoever if its for this week im going salanki and bruno i dont hate that noty but id also prefer to capan harry fpl harry says id play grees versus spurs if i could course you would harry you liar of course to be fair if harry if harry did that hed score he would definitely score thats how thats how this game works we know we know how this game works harry absolutely were familiar with your game harry as soon as you soon as youre plugged in to the official fpl guys and you start getting these so lets look around some other decisions hey i need i need you guys to talk to me about this one ry or fabiany listen this so i on world card e i think it was i you have to pick a second keeper i had joel ward at the time and i meant to put in fabianski and i didnt click save im delighted i didnt because id be having a benching headache with ederson this week i think ederson is probably the favorable one but im happy i dont have a second goalkeeper to mess around with who would i choose in that situation i think it has to be rare 24 chance playing for aral i choose fabianski 28 i me the only risk this is the thing though like for 70 minutes of the game at the weekend he was like the worst keeper of the worlds ever seen and then for the last 20 minutes he was bof on so i dont even know whether hes gonna start but then if hes not going to start it doesnt matter because youre gonna get ry in anyway but i think if youre g to pick the fixure i would pick west ham for this one because betto provided a great example that he also does miss big chances and if like if d plays dcl then you cash money arent you mate exactly whats im gonna play im gna play fabianski im gna bench dcl and dcl is going to score in five minutes against fabianski thats how fpl works baby harrys right if what if palmers if palmers not fit then you play ry thats exactly my point i was looking at it as if palmers not it but if he is fabians one you guys need to carry on for a sec i need to i need to nip out for a sec because my child is still still awake so hopefully the stream stays up fingers crossed but well well find out just a second lets lets do man united you just talked about them and you like the idea of d this week and just in general stats are good but its early were still on rude time before we get to mrm is it too early to go on this week no i think if youre going to do it has to be this week surely well the problems ive got with it is the three players well theres four players i think that are people like d gacho brun and hland and i do have slight question marks over every single one of them about where they sit in the new system because we expect d played left back again tonight probably play who knows where he plays on the weekend but like what if what if amam just says ill play masi right back and i want somebody to play the left and maybe thats even gacho plays left wing back and suddenly its like what do we do with him but we just we dont know and are they are they like such a slam dunk team that i can go well i know what im going to get from d i dont know and then im like well he could also play 3 4 2 1 and is that cuz hes played a lot amim and therefore im like where does bruno sit in that is bruno could be the nine then hes the best player in the game bruno could be in one of the two behind one of the best players in the game bruno could be in the pivot not one of the best players in the game caracho same deal like where is he and that b and oand again same deal like is he the nine thats going to be the one if hes going to be the nine and hes going to everythings going to be about him then hes just a fantastic pick so what youre telling is bruno is the best option probably hes the most reli of those ones he the most reliable i would agree it feels like hes the one where it feels like thats the one that you would go to but the hland one is one its probably hland is one its easy hland and do they easy two for me to get to cuz if wanted to move on lewis or move on dcl and im looking at those guys and thinking maybe i should and maybe i should go this week when its home to leicester we just talked about the worst away xgs and only shortly behind whips which is leicester it depends on your risk appetite though because between now and then youre not expecting much change in the team and even in that first week when he comes in like to think he wont mix it up too much do was too crazy again he easily could but i dont know i do like for sure bruno again i dont know what your stance was h before the season started when he was doing rubbish and then now i was always high on bruno again i dont think he was a bad pick i had him myself and i think go for the season he looks quite good i want to say again you knowed are so theyre such a big question mark on them but again its those question mark players that if you get right theyre what elevate you because people arent on them hes just hes just its the players around him that are causing him the problem its not its not him thats thats the issue hes not getting it was the f the first game against fulham where he gets those two big chances you feel like you feel like if he scores one or both of those then like the season just takes off right and everybody has him and what and it just carries on from strength to strength rashfords finishing has been average gachos finishing is its always average he just hasnt had the supporting acts with him to to make it work hland scored a couple of good goals but again everything just started to go a bit sour at the end of the the ten hog stuff so maybe this is a fresh start maybe this is we dont i dont expect i expect like brunos output to increase it has to like it simply just has to it has to it does it cant be la i agree especially with a player at his standard like he but i dont expect his data i dont expect his expected data to change like i expect that not to not to drop because of a change in a change in management here i dont think thats going to happen i agree with that i think the thing on brunos i expect his xa to go up but his xg will only naturally go up because bruno is bruno is objectively a bad finisher like hes im going to say hes like bottom tier finisher like when hes oneonone you expect him to miss almost every time he gets a shot within the sixyard box but what he is an incredible ball striker so if you look at his goals he misses a ton of 045 xg chances and he scores a load of less than 01 xg chances which then gets him back to up for it so when his overall xg is there but when you look at when you look at the number of chances that he misses that are not 02 03 04 xg its a significant number so he always has bits he will always have parts where he looks like hes massively under his xg and then hey guess what by the end of the season he gets back because he will at some point probably in these next few games score a goal thats like 01 xg its what he does but like we saw it just on the weekend like header he had about 3 n hes going to when he get when through and he was like six yards out with a header theres not theres not a fan alive that watched it that thought hes going to put that in the goal nobody does like he just doesnt but when the ball rolls to him and hes 20 yards out you just think hes going to stroke in the corner i think br has an excellent choice with these next three fixtures and especially i think there were people that planning maybe go palmer this week as an option therell be a few now where theyre thinking well i just got bruno at the moment bruno for a couple and then i me im inan exactly that boat exactly that boat right now if i can if i can find but then the only one the only way for me to find the money is to sell harland and that sucks because its two transfers its a minus four and like you got it last week you i say got away with it but you you managed to cover your hit last week by selling harland but that wasnt a fun experience was it its not fun sorry its never fun have we spoken go on its okay as soon as soon as your soon as youve got scores like as soon as he scores it was fun like it was even if he scored at the end i was like well im not losing now you do need you need your players to hit if you havent got harland and they miss like if they miss but youve got more chance that your players will hit if you dont have harland in your team because the overall quality of the rest of your team is much better because you spend 15m completely agree and that was how i was born last season no one else was going without h it what i was doing man its so mad how it works out but the game is so much more enjoyable for me without him im back with no hland i went i done the move last week with h kuna and salah and i feel rejuvenated again got nice agree now and i cant wait for him to score a hatch versus brighton this week where i dont own him i do know its going to happen but thats exactly the position i felt like straight away the second the previous game we finished was like i want to have my options to have anybody that i want in this game and the best way for me to do that is to not have harland and back yourself that you can pick the players around it that will work hes going to hurt at some point though he is he is sp is just a game in know game wolves assets any other talk about wolves assets because again we got to talk cuz people either have already gone but theyve theyre maybe not sure about the decision theyve made or theres still people looking at whether they should pick kuna or strand lson or like if you want a defender from wolves then its ain nori or nothing but there was something interesting again rob t is just like cracking out smashing out these fantastic fantastic ones was the wrong one this one with the goal shares by game week and its pretty close its pretty close between coa and st lson he does get a higher share generally if they both score if they both contribute then or if they both score then co is getting co is getting the bonus but i dont know whether cabia coming back in makes a difference i dont think so well i think cabia got in all the places that youd want to be in thats a problem like when i look at it and think well and for stran lson if hes got cabia and can putting it on a plate for him then thats good for him full stop like i think hes a good option do you want to double up an attack with both of them this tough is its tough but okay this week its tough but its cheap as well its just how often you can bring yourself to do it because the numbers are still bad now everyones going to say but of course theyre bad cuz the fixtures theyve had and all that stuff but theyre still bad like they are now as an overall lowest in the entire league for xg when would we ever do it when would in any world would we go i want double attack i want both forwards from the worst attack in the league what surely you wouldnt classify wolves as one of the worst attacking teams in the league would you like surely this is a good chance for them to maybe gain some and get back into the 14 15th realm but it also around this though it sways this like this chart will looking at here when theres very small samples its all in pockets because frankly thats the only place its going to if you looked at if you did this with tottenham for example its going to be wider because theres more goals you do it with liverpool you do it in man city like even with man city youll have one big guy but everybody else is quite spread because they creating so much when the teams not created hardly anything its going to be limited where they where they where these play out half it half reminds me of the son kane season that we saw however on on a tear down from there the fixtures the fixtures you can you can build whatever narrative you want around the fixtures because we havent seen fixture run like this before and i dont think they have to run they have to run as probably like the fourth or fifth best team for the next nine weeks to get back in amongst it cuz if they dont theyre still going to be bottom by christmas yes and its whether you trust its whether you trust that they can do that i dont know its its funny that you compared it to son and kane but if p spartans in the chat compared it to emanuel dennis josh king which people did double up on and that worked out they did brilliantly well it only worked out badly because emanuel dennis got sent off in a double trip i had plenty of josh king that season it didnt work out good for me even i seem to remember not having either of them because i said they were bad players from a bad team im not doubling up im not doubling up lets not lets not be around it but then also wolves are not a promoted side no so i think there are worse attacks i know i talked about on sunday i was impressed with how they moved the ball v palace but i also noticed that when someone moves the ball at them like they just they can do what they like thats cool though because i dont i dont have their def im talk me personally like dont have their defense just have their attack then or just have one of their attackers and you can by looks of this you can pretty much pick either one and its probably okay its probably okay its probably okay its probably okay but not both no well look at this look at this is it this is it this projection is here so lets count how many lets count how many people were projected to get more goals than strand lson and then i wish you have asked i wish youd have asked us to do this pre pod because otherwise its going look terrible for the next 30 seconds so 17 players before you get to stran larson and then another seven 24 players so we insane before you get to kuna as the most projected goals this weekend its pretty close were all going to say theres that many but realistically youve got esack at 044 whos what eight from the list down to kun at 37 so its its pretty its pretty minimal in terms of what were seeing there but its not like so home to southampton this is the fixture like danny welbeck home to man city is predicted to get more goals the matas kya thats doesnt sit right with me lad it doesnt doesnt sit right on me at all like look at it this week im like okay whos the highest projected of the sub 65s its chris wood again of course it is its chris wood again its a good fixture for him as well home old club old club old club where you didnt have a great time you want to put all those narratives in there so help me out boys because neither have you got dcl have you no thank god dont pick dont pick bad players from bad teams mate i do the honest list youve got dman neil mate and hes hes not even okay fine okay carry on i dont think championship defenders got i dont got the other one shooting yourself in the foot mate were all stupid in this game but dcl was there and i so if theres a doubt on partner then i feel like i have to move on dcl because rogers is there as an option but if not then i dont know if ill get 11 players out so i feel like probably should just make the move on dcl as my move the more i think about it is probably thats where i should make it and you look at it this week and you say well ive got the money hilands right there 051 did you just attack it with the threee fixtures he hasnt got pens hes probably also limited on minutes wood is right there i almost feel like you get youll make this own narrative in your head though because chriswood has done so well that would almost sade me not to go there its this thing i always do its not the right thing at all it does so the new shiny ty highland might be the one because youre like ive got to try because im like i dont even know why im two and a half million now whatever it is then im like well ive got to try and get past the people that ive got wood so i need to get somebody else exactly what do you need to do in 12 well what would you do in 12 if you were to get chriswood i suspected just son sacka sunant saaka probably just would you bench wood against arsenal because rogers h to palace okay so then because that is the interesting thing with wood is about it is that theres a slight headache if i went oand of like who do i play next week well we dont even know if hland starts next week nam room comes in right no cuz talking brand new manager so because as much as much as it is like just get chris wood because its an easy bench to week and then and then again week 13 i get that get the home to it switch i was going to say whis but probably like the fixtures are pretty much the same cuz brenford are so crap away from home it probably doesnt matter and again 13 is the big leicester home fixture but do i just try and ruin chris wood for everybody so theres another player that we were sp speaking about a small bit in the group chat that is jedro i know adam you brought him up as well would you be more than happy to wait until next week go for a jo pedro even though its a small bit of risk rather than going to a wood its just i still dont know whether jia pedro is better than danny welbeck still i dont think we know that anymore dani ws been so good that i just ru has been good as well i know hes gonna bring hes probably gonna bring him straight back in but rout has been pretty good as well he been pretty good so it doesnt feel like it doesnt feel like he has to throw him straight in and youre right its the game week 13 is the one against southampton at home if youre g to bring him in that week and then theres evan nson down at down at bournemouth i like it but i dont like it enough i dont love it maybe i should just get chris bloody wood it might it might just it might just solve your it might just solve your problems so you dont have to think about it as you say you can bench him next week bench him against city and then the fixtures arent good though like forest fixtures are objectively bad over the next 10 when youve not got harland youve got eight youve got eight decent players this is true rogers fixtures are getting better again now is maybe i need to look at the rotations around rogers and wood but when youve got ive got bumo salah palmer and it be sack or son youre playing those every week salanki and kaa im playing them every week at the moment theres no chance of the picture even the man city game ill play sank all day long in that game small bit off topic but when do you see yourself getting rid of emo or do you well its crazy price now like it is a crazy price but i am i honestly did look at it and was like is bruno is bruno for brian like the worlds worst option for next three theyve got two home games brenford got two home games theres just too much there potentially the eo i well just not even just not even just the eo i just think there i just think theyll create enough big chances in the next two games in the next two out of the next three games i just dont think that like boomer will get a couple of those chances right and bruno wont get those he will be provide hell be more on the creative side just trust boo just trust i think game week 14 i think its a its its a definite consideration option its just trying to figure out who the best person at that fixture when those fixtures get to 14 like what do you what do you do from there well by then foden might be cheaper than bumo so maybe le highway swap you look down at the fixtures in 14 and there are just loads and loads of real crap to be honest its difficult you could do to palmer like that and maybe just get lets do our guest team lets do the guest team you can teams we need do teams and get out were almost at an hour so thats good mr chai i have now changed your name i dont know whether you saw it said har im not harry no more no team you want me to run true for the podcast please mate thatd be great so on goal weve got ederson h treb lewis alexander arnold eight nori h four in midfield muhammad salah in buo garnacho and palmer three up top salanki kuna and hts its not in this image but currently the iron band is on dominic sanki and of course rogers mikeno and greaves on the bench when you sent me the image did it have salanki captain i cant remember so thats on me if so thats on me good so i have 1m or i have one free transfer 18 in a million similar space to you baker originally at the start of the week i spoke on stream quite a bit on last week potentially doing isach for hits and this week i also like that move of course they play first and i think newcastle look a bit sharper than weve seen in those first six seven games and gordon is back playing well so hes definitely w us on my mind another one is upgrading lewis of course of ederson on goal just dont know how much of fancy going into the common game weeks were player that i dont know if hes going to start or not and i just dont fancy playing m mikeno every week like we spoke about other than that eight home fixtures looks absolutely brilliant its funny is it i look at a similar thing i think all of us look at it goes l of home pictures this week but we just looked at the we just looked at the odds a minute ago and its not great like because of week but as soon as you see a lot of homes youre like well im in for a good week here i got these homes so do you think you move habits out i dont know dont feel like weve got anything solid on habits i dont even think he was on the gold the goal list a second ago that we just looked at so i feel inclined s and off that list i feel inclined to move them on but then again i look at fixture next week and the week after it only gets better for arsenal i cant see this dip in form to continue so and i will eventually want the point a piece of that arsenal attack so how i get there is a question for me fair enough what about would you consider benchin hs and looking at someone even for say bodgers like you could get brennan dont do that to me dont be doing that to me im not considered that hes so good at this hes so good at this like seriously every week hes like you consider this im like hold on gacho you got g already that is spicy because then i go into the game week and my team is fairly differential in general i would say i dont think too many have the double up on a nori kuna unless you of course brought in salah like everyone else but i had a strong attack in slanky hland and haris of course i only moved out of but now ive got garnacho with a nice lesser home and especially if i go from rogers that would differentiate the team you have me thinking i dont know though hav if he does play against his old team something nice about it he scored two last time he played him 74 minutes against him he want to be fit looks good and if the fact that od came off the bench sh mod starts big game they need it sh mode starts which means that youd hope i say hope like fre tottenham fans here hope that trossard would drop out and that od would go in and that means that have earth is back at nine as well and it was a cut so you think hes going to be fine couple of stitches or whatever wasnt it be fine or i could just roll i could im in a place where like if i roll no problem i could easily make a transfer no problem like i dont think i need to be too worried about it like on paper it is good what do you do if what do you do if theres news that palmers at then i would definitely be more inclined to make rogers a sixo someone midfielder that gets interesting then how much has he moved in price now for everyone i havent even looked you stick him in at five and then ive never looked at him since who like well when do you want him back and thats like in few weeks time unless you do something wild like find a route to watkins for example its whatever you do want in back when its because it if youre not if youre going to stay without harland for a long time then you might decide you do want more in mfield with a five but i dont know what id get for rogers let me have a let me have a quick look on that one i can stretch to 7m if i take get 52 rogers 52 so i b five its 54 now 52 do who id love if i could do it if i could do this move i would do it a hary and this gordon 72 on point2 off i think gordon isnt being spoke about rightly so because he got an injury recently but i think hes definitely an interesting one and hell be back in conversation soon and the spicy move would be if you did take some money out of havers then a minus four get rogers up to bruno were looking at that now imagine that like double united defense it sounds great its there its there lets see ill need to tamper a small bit more fair enough lets and i dont always say fair enough when i disagree clearly up to you also fair enough we just want to move on thats i have many uses for it i have many uses your teammate so i also have one free transfer 18 in the bank which is probably like a standard amount if you took harland out last week decision in goal fabianski or ry cently got fabianski in there leis a nor and gabrielle of the defense son boomo palmer salah rogers is my current team with salah with the ar as it stands k and salanki up top and at the moment ive got dcl first bench m go second and greaves last sh gavves hopefully will be back after international break i think it makes you more twitchy when youve only got the four defenders and you got that last one youre like god how much am i potentially going to get into that last one despite the fact that my defenders get one point every week so im not sure what that bothered about it especially eno your fourth defender i dont trust i just dont trust c lean enough to start i just think bet done enough so unless d d was d pretty much gave it away last week and they he talked about betto still needs to do a lot of work to get into being a starting player so hopefully he might get ar something similar because if he is starting well i dont know what im saying it because im plan the blood west dam keeper i shouldnt say it was a good fixture but westan does feel like a good fixture so and it sounds like mcneel might be struggling as well whicho think is pretty good for everon so i suspect i take cal l out and im starting to come around to the idea that maybe i should stop trying to be too clever with it and just get chris wood bench rogers i do think though if i chris would in my team would i always struggle to bench him remember again because hes a penalty taken at a number nine probably the same its probably ill probably face into the same pain that i had when i was like cal len where it was like i want to play him every week because hes number nine on pens but at least chriswood scores fair point okay i need to what i need to do is have probably more a look at the fixtures and rotations around rogers and dcr because with the other guys i just dont see myself im going to bench him just dont see it okay so thats me and then up to me you see rogers firmly planted on my bench right at the back right at the back im ready to get hurt there again so ive got johnston in goal at the moment who wont play but its southampton at home so if he does play its a great fixture trent gabrielle porro at the back matas nunes brian son and mcneel dont love that having too many that im not particularly comfortable with and then salanki harland anda up top captain c is currently on sun emmy martinez lewis davis and rogers on the bench it is a bit awkward having you say mcneil and mat nunes there and it feels like if theres an opportunity to take money out ive only got 09 in the bank so theres not many options for me to upgrade and to maybe take some pressure off that midfield i maybe would play lewis or do i just play rogers it probably doesnt matter i should probably just play rogers in fairness which is probably what i need to do is probably play rogers over the one that im not sure about im not sure im going to be making any transfers this week i dont again see a huge amount of upside and going anywhere near any more liverpool this week yes its a home game thats also al why rogers is on my bench because i got trent in defense that mcneil to garnacho mcneil to garnacho option potentially so this is this is the source was joe thomas who said that briman neils a doubt for evertons trip to western this weekend it was set to undergo a final assessment on friday so hopefully some news there its an away game as well and so good chance they might get some traveling news and were a late deadine as well knee injury which hampered his preparations ahead of the game versus southampton last weekend has since flared upir flare up doesnt sound flare up doesnt sound too bad adam ice pack where do you stand with tren its not one that a lot of people are speaking about i think a lot of people that owner are more than happy to hold them do you want more are you happy to how hes done so far im fine with what hes done so far just but i dont think hes worth the money that ive paid for him or got in him at all so would you would you be looking going forward to get rid of him thats what im trying but the problem the problem is i want to get rid of trent i want to get rid of porro i want to get rid of nunes mcneel and lewis and then i want to do a hokey koke on rogers and get rid of harland so its its its difficult when youve only got one free transfer to make seven so ive got to try and pick my battles trent going to be the one thats going to free out the most money well no harland will but trent front but trent fre is up three million not three million well maybe three million two and a half million immediately anyway so it just feels odd going down to canate i just it just feels like a weird move i think if you havent got canate i think if you havent got canate and youre looking for that price bracket mid defender i think its a pretty fine move but when youve already got trent and youre its going to go canate it just feels a bit weird so it might be the one though because its its 17m that gives me enough to take mcneil to bruno for example honestly the way i see canate versus tren at the moment is canate has an opportunity to score on every corner that liverpool get but trent has the only has the ability to return on half of them is cans in the box for every single one of them but trents only taking one side like it and you get double the points if you score them now van dyks there as well blah but doesnt mean its can score them all but i dont think its a huge loss at the moment to have canate i dont and i would spend less time thinking about that move and more time thinking about the yes if i you offered me for example if you offered me son and tren or you offered me salah and canate then probably go sorry i said get son and trent or sal and canate i have son canate forward not this weekend if you thats i think thats fair enough in isolation i think looking at the rest of the team i dont think its its not doesnt feel like a problem area no but the only way youre going to address the fact that youve got three five million pound midfielders is to sell the big guy you cant you cant and he he has to go by he has to go in 12 like whatever so so whatever happens he has to go in 12 and do i think its because 12 can be 12 versus tottenham hes gone for that hes gone for that r going to put him on his ass its fine the question the question does come back on these ones is can you do it c can you do it with free transfers or do you just do it with hit i probably need a hit either way like i probably need a hit i dont mind a hit but if i do it this week i probably take four points and then i take probably another four points next week i probably take eight anyway if you looked at this week and said expected points on say harland and one of the midfielders that you dont want either mcneil or nunes who would you bring in this week if you were to switch that around salah and which striker thats the thing like the problem with the strikers this week is that all the strikers feel like id want to get off them again very quickly whereas i think next week i can look at i can see about xia pedro welbeck i can im one fixture further away from a good chris wood fixture and im one fixture further away from wiissa and im one fixture further away from say stran larson so therere the difficult ones so maybe it is this week maybe is maybe it is gambling on the fact that i dont i dont know in brighton next week i dont know that we gain anything from brighton versus man city that gives us info to know which is the best brighton stroker for the better games no thats thats thats thats also well at least p j pedro playing would might be a might be an indicator thats definitely that might help thats definitely a bonus but i think i think i think it does look inevitable that you are going to have to take the plunge probably on holland with 35m powerman fielders and palmer and salah with pretty decent pixture bs yeahs how much money can i get down from har i cant if i take harand like matas is only 49 so its difficult to get very far up there well you can still switch harand holland mat for example is still cheaper than salo and any striker under 7m yes then i cant do anything with mcneil id like to almost do two but can i how many ch i know i know then because then im taking out trent at that point as well and then when then it gets to like i dont know 1 am on saturday morning then im bringing in knows who like who knows at that point palmer and 12 is going to be the one isnt it even if you sell this week it would be what do i do what do i do to get palmer and 12 where if you roll you can work it out well it mean getting palmer and 12 would involve like trent and sun well not if you dont go salah not if i dont go salah so if i went bruno then so like i think in 12 for example like i think watkins i think watkins starts to get better again come past 12 absolutely z watkins say again isach or watkins i think isach and watkins get better but i like i like watkins post the international break i look at it i think the home palace games good game so potentially likes what harland and nunes becomes watkins and palmer for free and then works all around a bit palmer can cover a lot of the salic caps he cant theyve got theyve you got theres going to be decisions to make when theres games like 12 is a decision to make on palmer versus salah its a big old decision southampton or leicester we can we can leave that convers we can leave that conversation for a few weeks we can leave that conversation for a few weeks so thank you to everyone in the chat make sure youve hit the like button before you leave today theres questions any questions not any questions what are your thoughts on lewis versus vardal tempted to make the move between the two the sideways thats a luxury move sounds very luxury not sure id be making that no im not sure i be making it i dont like the fixtures i dont like the i dont like the clean i think vs been an incredible pck and i think hell still continue to be like if you think that youre going to have viio as a longterm hold to 38 then i think its okay but i look at it and think the next four or five weeks i dont think i want viio like id rather take the chance on someone like d like you said well get ca back is ca back on the menu soon ben white maybe something like that maybe that might come up chelsea winning 8 nil apparently christoper and kungu back on the score sheet two for felix as well its good because they dont they dont play at the weekends so colin johnson says remember guys saints only considered one goal at city when everyone was talking about triple captain harand wolves might be a tight game id imagine southampton approached that game a little bit differently i would assume so to as well i think southampton will still get to play though like southampton we have seen when theyve gone out and play they like they can move the ball and i think what we saw in that palace walls game last week was both teams were just trying to move the ball so i do think theyd be goals i think it will be will be pretty different and how they are ive just noticed in game week 12 that palmers the first game of the game week at half1 12 the f is saying dont say everybodys going to c in salah because hes on sunday just wait dont tell anyone everybody is gonna captain salah because hes on sunday would you play rogers this week or smith row didnt even talk about fulham but we didnt talk about monday nights game at all who f got palace exactly dont like but thats for me phil are making some decent chances what if what if harry wilson scores a braak and then just starts ahead of him this weekend though thats a good point did just score a brak like he could easily just walk in and take that place its probably still my thr just i probably play smith row madison to bruno absolutely in a hobby ryan football chat box says hello last couple of questions hello to you ryan question for chai how long do you intend to keep g atro for and whats your favorite type of tea okay so this is a brilliant question how long am i going to hold g atual for i think it depends on what we see from amaron when he comes in the obvious answer for me is 14 because they play against arsenal but again it depends on the situation if suddenly united are drawing against leester and nips wi i think i could bin them off and ever if it comes to it in terms of my favorite tea mint tea is my favorite and the reason is is because it balances your hormones there you go very good never get you never get you never get positive health stuff on here other than your life helps there you go there you go if it helps my two favorite tees are mint and chai so perfect there you go the both last question from sally well okay well ill do the adams as well because hes shares the same name as me so that would be terrible if i did not include him sally says captain salah on or salanki thats what were talking about its all three of us so lets lets talk it im currently on mo ch youre currently on salanki thats right and im currently on currently on son there you go perfect so were completely split good luck would you play whist or seeno a wher id play seeno you play seeno over whis okay im not sure i dont agree with that i just bford at home isnt it brenford at home for me i play wi okay were two1 there no worri sally you just got here you can rewind and watch everything if you want but thats fine because wes plan against fleen though sorry ss plan about planning against fleen he was excellent for 91 and a half minutes was he on monday when you ruined his clean she ch did you see that did you see the i did but did you see the did you see the messages that baker was we were talking on whatsapp okay so adams the dark side in our world in this one in the i was saying i dont mind the fleck and clean sheet because jimenez would gone off whist had gone off smith row had gone off i was like as long as they all blank i dont mind i dont mind the fleck and clean sheet thats offset by boom get his fre points hell be fine i was fine about that adams like no i want i want i want misery all round absolutely hes on three hes on three bonus he was like three save points i was like hes going to lose his clean and lose all his bonus i want minus seven points off flecken please as they kept doing those p roller shots at fleen i was getting annoyed about it myself because i was just like youre just giving him save points what are you doing for it so i was like i said something like let them dream get the wipe out in 0 in the 92nd minute and i said that with like 25 minutes to go 25 minutes a half an hour to go and it happened bang on 9 thanks the first thing i looked at no joke the first thing i looked at was not my phone when the goal went in the first thing i looked at was the time it was instantly because knew were in injury time so the goal goes in i look at the time 9130 and im like this is amazing just text baker started doing it and they people started showing screenshots of their 12 pointers and all that stuff and then best thing ever when it dropped to when it dropped to like seven points whatever i was like ah still okay though is it and then four you were like its funny that was the worst thing about the worst thing about the the winner was he loses he goes down and loses all of his bonus in that moment because he was still top bonus after conceding the first one so he lost all his bonus annoyed the fact that he had the bonus well its just man just volume of saves and stuff wasnt it but the fact that he lost the bonus looked amazing until and hes like he was like 20 owned and then until you realize that robinson got the assist and he was like 25 owned so like the three points just went the other way i cannot believe how high the ownerships were in that monday night game throwing like a third of teams we havent had a good monday night football in a while now you say that ah the game we play the game we play the games gone chai thank you for joining us cheers boys for having me on been a pleasure it has it has full spurs by us this week we do

7,fplbanger,-Bzw8BNZkdQ,FPL GW 11 : Solanke &amp; Semenyo in &amp; 1 last chance for Haaland? - FPL 2024/25,2024-11-07T12:45:05Z,oh this thing hello everyone welcome back to the F Banger show my name is Sila and I'm joined by Sam gameweek 11 Sam and once again this continued thing where you don't own Haren and he just keeps not doing the points keeps working for you and now he's even blanking in Champions League I know right ND would expect and what a horribly taken penalty as well the curse is working Sil all because he told ATA to be humble I mean yeah that since then right this man has been true he he has scored one goal since that comment in in the league anyway and it I mean did you see the sporting game because I found it very weird like it's just City again lot of chances a lot of XG but it's just it's just not for them right now yeah yeah I don't know what's going on I mean STS wise hland is still doing the business right like insane amount of X I think the most X any player has got in the past four weeks the most shots on Target and it's just you know some black magic stuff is going on you just can't seem to score I mean since uh game week five no player has more XG than and Holland in the entire league so SAA I feel like all this is set up just so that you can say yeah I sold him you would think that right but no see I I've held on to him and here's here's why let me let me show you why right okay so you know you've got you got on the screen you can see Holland's run a form and I think a lot of people's frustration is because if you look at this uh chart that we have on the screen is they bought him in game six and that's when the blank started for those who started with no no hen right yeah uh and you just know moment you sell him he'll start scoring again yeah because what what we talking about here we're still talking about one of the top three teams in the league yes things have looked bad but de bruy back on the bench midweek you would expect probably 30 minutes this weekend maybe more you don't we don't think of bright is a strong defense home or away I still feel like this is not a place where I want to sell and my maybe this is the wrong analogy to draw but a lot of people don't have Salah for all these hard fixtures right where Salah scored against Chelsea scored against Arsenal and the reason is because of these are hard fixtures but you and I discussed this like a few weeks ago the nice thing about premiums is they're meant to be fixture proof a good premium is worth their price because they can haul in any fixture so yeah he's been bad in these fixtures but he's not been so bad in sens of he's not getting chances he's you can argue to a large degree some regression sure but it's also unlucky right the Bournemouth game I mean he has a chance from like six yards out same thing against Southampton should have scored a hattick like I the more people sell and this is probably I don't know this is not sunken CA fallacy this is like bottom of the ocean fallacy at this point cuz as far as I can see nobody else own this guy um but I'm so tempted to hold on to him because the more people sell him the more I want to keep and I feel like that Hall is it just logically this guy can't keep blanking his stats are good at some point it's going to tick I don't think this is Saka fallacy like I feel like there's some validity to me just holding on yeah I think it's not SOS FY because the stats back up that he's just underperforming and you would expect him to you know catch up with his stats right right so yeah like I always said you know I don't think having harand has ever been a bad FPL move it cannot be a bad it's just what you do with the remaining funds I'm happy um not owning harand because he has blank but also also I have used the funds wisely do you know what I mean like we said was it last last episode you could have gone DCL instead of wood and it wouldn't have made a difference whether they high or not you know you know what I'm saying so it really is depends who are you how you getting with all this extra money okay I mean we're going to keep having this conversation every week but I suspect at this point I'm very much in the minority of people who still want to keep holding but yeah I think he's the most s player this week I think yeah because it's it's obviously just the most frustrating blank like he needs to score most weeks to make this worth it uh because he cost that much um I would say I would say see what I think most serious serious FPL players are still keeping him the people selling are mostly casuals I think no man you you this is the one of the maybe the positives but also one of the negatives of you not being so plugged into Twitter and all this other stuff is unfortunately all the main content creators all all the people who everybody follows Andy and so on they've all sold and so people follow the her right so unfortunately it's not I wouldn't say it is a casual thing I think it's it's permeating into serious people again I don't care I hate that I hate that people are fooling my template now yeah I mean you are the template exactly yeah but I don't I mean I'm really not concerned with ownership I I generally don't care how much I I don't check Holland's ownership I don't care about his EO none of those things matter to me it's just that I I watch the games I feel like this guy is so close to scoring a brace every week that I don't think that's copium I think it's just things have sort of events have taken place where he's been unlucky and there been some bad finishing but also just mostly unlucky still getting the chances de br's back and if I've held this long how can I sell when now the guy who I would assume is the solution to all of their problems and now is the time when they fix it and I'm going to miss out on these Halls because I just chickened out at the end okay fair enough fair enough let's see another red hour for me this week with this guy when he blanks uh you did well we both no no we scor the same points we on this this part we only do green arrows uh unlike the rest of your content creators we we have Salah we Captain Salah and we have all the other guys around them to get points um you got to go from Madison so oh I mean he scor yeah yeah yeah in like two how many minutes did he play eight minutes eight minute C and you still got a go Gods are on my side what can I say Gods on definitely on your side but speaking of Madison and that sort of price range of midfielders we had a question here from fbl H's good good friend of the port is it time for Bruno and I mean nice fixtures Portuguese manager coming in Bruno Fernandez already back on the score sheet last week um thanks to Robert Sanchez but still you know we pen goals are still goals Sam you texted me the second tenha got sa to say it's time for Bruno so I assume you've already got him in U I think that was that semi sarcastic S I would say wait I have very low confidence on all United assets right now even with a new manager coming in he may be a good pick but we don't know for sure and I'm willing to wait a little bit but the issue with waiting is the fixtures are good now like if you're going to go in on United your window is basically the next three right we've got it on the screen now mhm Arsenal forest and City from gaming 14 onwards you don't want to touch those so you basically need to go in now for leester if Swit and Everton it's either now or never if you ask me need to go in now you tell me United fan or is it because you're a United fan you're so burned so pessimistic this is e manager since Ferguson and you pretty much um exactly like what you said I just have such low confidence on United assets even with a manager I mean we've gone through so many managers didn't really make that much of a difference so yeah I still bad to me I mean the same problem still happen against Chelsea right creating chances can't finish like you said Bruno's goal was somewhat lucky if that never happened would you even be discussing Bruno right now same problems are still there any other United is there would you feel safer if you went slightly cheaper maybe hland up top obviously or gacho I mean a lot of United fans seemed very frustrated with gacho at one point I think casmiro shouts at him right because he yeah messes up a chance against Chelsea but he getting in good positions yeah there's always two sides to a coin right so there one side that's it's like he's getting into good positions at least you know so that's a positive to be seen the negative is that he's getting good positions but he's wasting all of the chances with back with bad um final product so two sides so coin I still think gacho is our most dangerous player and if there was a United player that I would get it would be gacho but right now I just wouldn't get any hland because it's I think it's a forward and there's just so many possible forwards you can get right now so not too keen on hland right now you're really not enticed by I mean Lester and ipswitch in particular right let's look at these three fixtures right Lester have been really bad all season they scraped a point against iwit last week like last kick of the game Jordan a SC by then iwi should have closed the game I themselves don't defend very well and then Everton lost to Southampton how bad do you have to be to lose to Southampton me okay I have very little faith in United SAA so I could be wrong Runo could score like five goals in the next three games but I don't know I think it's just you should not ask a United fan this question I'm really really pessimistic on my own team I think as a non-united fan I think Bruno a very reasonable pick this week I think these three fixtures are As Good As It Gets as long as you've got an exit plan in gameing 14 I think you can go in I honestly would consider even Highland I would consider gacho I would even consider Dalo you can get an attacking Defender oh I will consider United Defender that I would consider because United's defense has been quietly solid despite what you know I think we we talked about it uh few weeks back about how like in the top Defender rankings there are actually a lot of United Defenders it's just you know there people get caught up with the memes and all that I think they've been solid okay so United defense your down so if I do Dalo this week you're you're cool with that because I'm quite Keen bearing in mind and of course it's risky because new manager coming in but Ruben amarim likes to play with wing backs now he did say that he can't do everything he does in spotting the same way at United obviously and you could argue United is probably not built to accommodate that system but it feels like somebody like Dalo maybe I'm oversimplifying the same thing with Bruno right but Portuguese guy Portuguese coach very attacking plays for the national team feels and gets forward right so Dalo feels like an interesting pick and the kind of pick that most people won't go for yeah I agree there is a bit of um yeah I think the the Wing backs are question mark right now for United cuz we don't really have Wing backs um you could play Dalo could play masi who's going to be a left wing back there talks that maybe he'll push rashford or gacho back will he will he play Just invert Doo as a left wing back like there are a lot of when it comes to Wing backs so yeah I I I personally am not touching any United player right now okay so in United is just too uncertain because even if the fixtures are good the change in manager and the thing is whoever is you know vanoy will take this game and then after it's amarim for and Everton and maybe that is just too uncertain switching froming back four for years and suddenly playing with a you know back five how will the defense handle it will there be a transition period all that kind of stuff yeah I too too much uncertainty keep I'm I'm not going near them and maybe also you couple with the fact that we got an international break after 11 so you don't know what injuries and also couple the fact that this is a very short fix your run it's just the next three so if you don't already own maybe this isn't long enough to justify a hold because the 14 15 16 are really bad you want to play Arsenal you don't want to play forest and you don't want to play City you would have to imagine City by both Aral City away as well it's like it's pretty much two of the toughest fixtures you could get yeah and for all Arsenal and City's current problems you imagine by 14 15 16 they'll have fixed that um so maybe again because we I'm sure that the temptation of Bruno sure it's United fans sure it's fixtur sure it's new manager high but also it is his price we always think about people based on prices we hold them up to their price we like guys because he's 8 million it sounds really nice maybe the right answer here if you're looking for a midfielder second in the sticker that we have on the screen right now Bournemouth Anon Sano surely that's the simple pick that isn't sexy because a lot of people owned and a lot of people sold right cuz when he started blanking or he didn't return people just got rid but back in the goals last week 10p pointer man at the match performance against City like really good right that that goal especially so much composure they play brenford Brighton wolves Spurs IPS West Ham and if you if you ask me would you rather have a wolves attacker Wolves at top of the sticker or bonemouth attacker surely you'd want Bournemouth that depends I guess so like for wolves I only consider their forwards they don't really have any viable Midfield picks no and for Bon is kind of you know I consider s so it works out well I guess you could have the both of the best of both worlds seanu in the Midfield uh Str L alun as a forward you say that but I think Evan Nelson's been picking up recently Evan is an option too as well he's been good he's been good but you know I I brought in K last and I'm happy with that and uh with the fixture run coming up I continue to be happy I think so come back to my point right if you need a midfielder this week why isn't it to menu why isn't seano the high pick this week why why are people just going yeah I think seano yeah I think SEO will be a really good pick yeah because Sano nailed 90 minutes plays every week is Talisman full of the attack if they score he's likely to be involved and these are un objectively these are really good fixtures brenford can't defend I mean uh I feel bad for Fen owners but that what happened on Monday night the most objectively funny thing if you don't own Fen right cuz he went what at 90 minutes he had 12 points and by 96 Minutes he had four um yeah brenford just can't defend I I saw that game and Fulham should have scored long before that so many chances Brighton we we know their issues wolves can't defend I mean you saw the palace game I'm already regretting I NRI like I watched this game and thought like how stupid I have to be these people give up chances for fun and no I mean I knew it's always been you you don't you're not getting any clean sheet he just hoping for attacking returns and by far he is maybe the most attacking defender in the league it's true but Palace came there came to wolves with no a no Waton and they still had that many chances it really shouldn't be that easy and both the goals are basic like school boy setpiece kind of Errors so that that doesn't board well for W's defense but it's great for Bournemouth Spurs we know Spurs ipswitch can't defend West Ham if they haven't sacked ly by game 16 I'd be surprised but bottom line this feels like a almost a no-brainer for Sanu and my my guess is that he's not as hyped because people just didn't get the returns they wanted earlier or they bought after all the returns and so now they're just not interested in going back or I more likely yeah it's a price point thing to me he's just too cheap like if he was 8 million they'd pick him over Bruno but because he's 5 million eh let me spend more money get Bruno maybe maybe I really like the piig I think and I think there is a lack of options in the Midfield the non- premum midfields so like I mean Saka Salah Palmer Sun like all these guys are good they have been Returning Sun maybe a bit less because it's been injured but the rest of them they've been good but then you go below right you know earlier in the season we had Diaz and all these guys but all of them has kind of fell off Diaz yes I know he's got a hatrick midweek so he should start but how long will that last right he starts this week he gets benched next week you got the Spurs now medon kind of lost his place I need to get medison out my team got Johnson who scored but I mean I think the recent weeks have shown us that SP are very very unreliable you target them for the easy fixtures and they don't return and they return you know just too inconsistent so yeah there's a real lack of midfielders I would say right now SEO looks good I'm happy to go with SEO I may do medicine to se but you have convinced me maybe I came I came prepared today okay B with kit and all that um because I I feel like it's definitely a price point thing and I think a lot of Reas has to do because people sold Holland they have so much money now and so I can't be spending five million on a midfielder whereas I still have harand so I'm still bothered I mean people don't have Rogers I saw people benching Rogers last week and again you know we've how many times have we had to say this Morgan Rogers is not vable he is a he's a starter yeah yeah agreed are there any other since we're on midfielders we spent so much time on mids are there any other mids worth looking at not too many yeah every Other M so the the midfielders are just really uninspiring right now slim pickings right it's it's funny how things change I mean Salah obviously you want to have Salah I think you cra by the way I think anyone who still does not have Salah right is you're you're playing F wrong cuz he has anet that in 10 game weeks has only blanked twice so blank twice has eight weeks of returns out of those eight weeks one was a six pointer one was a nine pointer and the remaining six were all double digit Halls what what more do you want from an what more do you I think the people who don't have Salah unfortunately are the people who have kept Trent and have kept Holland and all that yeah so I thought you know di will be able to cover Salah that kind of thing hey you you you mock but I I would love to have Diaz this week this week yeah but you wouldn't the past few weeks no but slot put Diaz up front this week hatrick and he said Diaz is my starting guy going forward obviously I mean things can change but if Lis Diaz keeps starting tempting again International break after this unfortunately so he'll be on another flight to barania or somewhere in Columbia yeah somewhere really far away it's going to get benched for Southampton of course he's going to get benched for Southampton yeah why am I even discussing this okay let's let's move yeah Midfield there's not many other options uh Bowen you're not going to hold much longer because this team will sack this coach at some point um maybe that's the key that's when you go into B yeah but you wait unlike you I'm not so down on Spurs but I'm happy that I just own Brandon Johnson that's the level of investment I'm willing to put in this team because they're so inconsistent I think it's one those like if you went in already you might as well keep especially you know switch coming up however if you were fresh will you buy a SP player right now I don't know okay let's explore that right maybe not convinced hey let's let's let's explore that right because they play this week and I suspect a lot of people will be looking at Sun and Solan because we're fickle people and Solan just one week ago everyone was like oh Solan is so bad yeah yeah but but those are the solank owners right those are the ones who feel like it was going bad again people who didn't own I didn't own you didn't own we didn't really care it wasn't something I mean I I wasn't worrying about it but two goals in the last 50 minutes and if switch is it tempting to go I mean are you allowed to take one we punts anymore in this game or because now we got five transfers you can't do that and you just got to ignore Spurs at home against Z switch I mean I think I think it is a decent part you got it Swit at home then City away which seems hard but city has been considering every game right like not saying they're going to win the game but is there a chance that's first score yeah I think so you know pretty decent chance and then you go back to fulam home Bond M away Chelsea home s Anon away so I mean not the best fix I say is really mixed and it's reflected here in the fixure list they right in the middle so up and down but I'm okay with Johnson I'm not too sure about Sando though because his minutes has been severely managed he came off at 55 uh 55th minute last weekend so I'm a bit concerned there I don't know how long it'll take for him to be able to get up to speed yeah not happy taking the risk of Sun at this moment right now despite you know a great fixture coming up yeah I guess my only concern is the fact that we are recording this on Thursday morning uh they play Galatasaray tonight Spurs and I don't think and just going to rest or rotate that much although it's just the Europa League because he's still under a little bit of pressure and Rich charon's out injured so Solan probably has to play 90 and then quick turnaround Sunday fixture against Switch I mean it's one of those if you own great but if you don't own I'd be tempted to just kind of swerve yeah okay fair enough midfielders are boring s let's move away from the midfielders let's talk about forwards because we did have questions here again fbl H but I think this is a question for everybody uh Welbeck or jao Pedro ja Pedro Flags removed back in training I've held this guy for like six weeks just randomly on my bench I mean he's it's all set up for him to come in come on as a sub and score the winner against city right yeah but well back with his track record that he's done the past few weeks I if I had to pick one right now like fresh going in I would pick well back it's insane I mean it's a bad fixture this week you know against City but then after that great fixtures right so and what's the price difference between them now wellex 5.9 what's J 5.5 yeah so it's not that big we have money right we all saw Holland we have money now I will go El back he's the third highest scoring in the game it is actually crazy the fact that you know because Well's not a template not definitely not a pick amongst the content creators so therefore he's not in and here's a step for you see he's only blank three times this season in 10 game weeks six his minutes are good right like he's playing constantly 70 plus 80 plus each week it's not like if he's coming off at halftime it's not as if he's coming off on 60 he's not getting injured he's not going to go away for the international break because England think they're better than Danny Welbeck I it doesn't matter he's who cares if he's 32 he should he should be walking into this England squad but they'll pick Watkins instead um I mean yeah I go Danny W in fact heavily considering Daniel W next week this feels like too too harsh of a jumping in point right now against City but next week is it yeah I mean you could arue you know city has lost blah blah blah three games in a row all that kind of stuff I'm just saying it like if I were to Fresh I wouldn't pick this week next week though looks good well I'm just saying that City just conceded a hatrick against someone who used to play for Brighton who was not respected yeah that's true that's true but he come on you can't say that he's the same player now and then right like what he's been doing the p that's been in I'm sure like if if Welbeck was watching yoker score the hatrick and thought you know Brighton man he can do it me Danny Welbeck United Legend ARA Legend Preston Legend all the Watford Legend you know all the other teams he's played I mean no reason why well can't score this week I I think it's one of those if it's yeah it's I mean timately we are boring people so it's kind of transer we won't make this week we will wait one more week just because we are boring people in VC it's not green on the fixture so therefore we won't go but I mean City have been so poor defensively what what are we waiting for consider four midweek they consider two against bmer don't keep clean sheets don't look solid no rry what are we waiting for here true that's true I con your point sa I'm going to bring well back this week now my problem SAA is that I really like my forward line I have K I have wood I have r who has playing the past two weeks since I brought him in after not after scoring like five in a row or something but I don't I don't want to take out any of them and I wouldn't I mean I wouldn't take out K this week I wouldn't take R himz yeah there have been some unlucky blanks but bottom line what still a very good fixture this week and I I wouldn't get rid of definely not taking out chriswood that's for sure chriswood the best forward in the in the world right now why would you take him out so yeah we have to rename our podcast as the Chris Wood lovers Club I mean we we were we were chriswood lovers before other people we yeah we loved wood you guys did yeah we got wood before everyone else and people still don't want to get wood they they feel like it's the fixtures are too hard and I mean people just being soft as far as I can see uh no no fixture is too hard for Chris I I'm happy to keep honestly this this run for Forest yeah looks a bit tricky right Newcastle Arsenal IPS City I've not even once considered selling Chris Wood I think the more interesting question is actually do you invest in Forest defense now or have you missed the chance because all other defenses don't seem to keep clean sheets anyway M yeah that's true that's true defense defense such a mindfield I wouldn't say it's a mindfield now it's just a Barren death in which no one is doing anything um Forest Defenders as well I mean yes they return this week but they've had was it four clean shits this season which is isn't really that good objectively it's just good compared to everyone else right yeah which is good mean is a cheap second best defense in the league what more do you want yeah that's true although fixure standing I don't know how many cles is going to keep against Arsenal City you know all these teams coming up Forest has been really surprising for us especially since you were so pessimistic on them at the start of the Season yeah I bought the hype I mean everyone thought Forest were going down I listen to too many podcasts know non FPL stuff and everyone was very negative on Forest I think even Forest fans were quite negative coming into the season they didn't sign anybody and if you think back to start of the Season it feels like a long time ago there was a lot of uh dis because they didn't get Ena because they bid for Ena they missed out on him and everyone's like we're going to the season with Chris Wood that's it of course well Ed get seven games in not a single goal yeah hindsight 2020 right no goals no assist for NK and Chris Wood meanwhile best striker in the country um yeah I mean if you needed to make a defensive transfer this week and if I'm being honest with myself I kind of do because my defense is awful but I like you probably just accept it nobody gets clean sheets anyway you don't even know who's going to get a clean so why am I wasting time rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic kind of thing yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a oh that's a good analogy Z reing deck chairs on the Titanic I like that yeah exactly yeah it's it's a matter of time before they all do their clean sheets anyway so why why bother but I mean allaa very tempting yeah he's not going to score bangers every week and his explanation for why he scored this week was hilarious he just said as naked M so I just I just thought I hit it yeah I saw that I saw that yeah but even all even you leave aside all Alex Moreno who's we liked at Villa getting consistent minutes now good assist this week um Matt sells has been great I'm so tempting just to we've liked milenovic who's been unlucky not to score so far mhm I mean if you had a defensive transfer to make it just feels again Arsenal IPS and new CLE next it just feels logically again one of those things right you just look at the fixtures and you can't bring yourself to do this even though they probably will get a clean in one of these two agreed agreed I think for us it's probably like the only defense you I wouldn't even use the word Target but could feel somewhat positively towards you know well you said United defense so I guess that is your if you're going in for a Defender this week right y yeah yeah that's would you would you spend and get Onana or that's going too far I mean no honestly I think Onana is a good pick in FPL this year um because United been cing so many shots he's been having a lot of saves so when we do keep clean sheets I mean it speaks byself he's um what's he top second second in the goalkeeper rankings only behind met cell and then Sanchez is dead so I goalkeeper rankings are weird now and Pope is fourth despite all the [ __ ] that we give uh you know newcast has been playing really bad this year so who knows what's happening I mean speaking of Newcastle right again is this I mean this is probably a very decent week to go in right for us the way yeah okay it's a fixure they could theoretically I mean yeah I think isak is a it's an interesting option right now I'm still not convinced by the defense but isak is isaking right now you know um so goals back to back I think isak could be a tricky option to go in the next I mean gaming 12 onwards looks really good for isach uh and you say the defense is not where you'd go but I think Louis Hall I had him in game week one and I'm really annoyed cemented his place yeah he's finally getting his his just rewards and he I thought he managed Saka very well last week um still really cheap looks nailed and these are really good fixtures from gaming 12 onwards okay and that's probably why you don't go Highland I guess because isak's just a level above un if be slightly more expensive yeah yeah is is a tasty differential I would say right now might have to sell harer next week don't like this okay very anyway um okay so that's I mean most of the people I guess if you are buying a woles forward this week I think this is an interesting question to me anyway because I don't I don't have a woles forward yet you say so much but Str lson cheaper here and there but K is Central to the attacking I think he's the Talisman of the team basically to me he always one the Talisman do you really want the guy who runs around a lot and passes to the guy who is going to score or do you want the guy who scores but he's also scoring K also scores you know it's not like he's a pure assist so he scores he assist it's good for bonus points because he's doing so much right let's okay let's sort of break this out I I think one of the reasons why I'm a little wary of kuna and I feel better about stran L and this going to sound silly because the prices aren't that far apart but it is one mil um wolves you have Holland that's [Laughter] fine that's that's part of it that to be fair when you have harand and Salah and Palmer like I do funds always tight so that that is one point I'll concede that but another point is also wolves have one win in 20 games uh we're in our we're in our FPL bubble so we don't care um because when none of us are wolves fans we don't care about this club they it's a transactional relationship that we have with them getting them in for a few nice green fixtures get rid of them but if you listen to I listen to a few Wes podcast this week and I was surprised by just how much these people hate the club they hate the owners and they hate the manager and they W him sacked yesterday and that worries me a little bit I don't think the Bulls owners care about any of this they've not invested that much uh in recent times anyway I feel in the club but the big issue for me is that if they do sack this guy cuz one win in 20 does sound really bad you can cut it no matter how hard the fixtures have been if they sack him next week and the new guy comes in and doesn't like Kia's face doesn't like strand lson because he's too tall and you keep looking up to talk to him I don't know could be anything right and then you've bought these guys where and you had Danny Welbeck right there nailed 5.9 for a much better team you had Chris Wood slightly more expensive for a much better team also Neil you had Ral Herz again I'd say a better team you had Yan WIA also better team all of these guys safer picks better teams managers who are not likely to get sacked next week why are we messing about with WS players I think it's just the fixtures right we're blinded by the fixtures maybe and I think those are valid concerns SAA but how can you predict when a man will be sacked or not right all you got is what you have in front of you and I think the fact that they're all kind of similar price points like okay you could bring in a WS player they play against South at home hopefully some goals there and then manager get sack let's say they lose to southon like I don't know 43 or something like that he gets sack in the next week you can easily just move them off cu the chip you can move them to well back you can move them to whoever it is but you're not going to do that right you're going to stick it out for these next six while a new magic I mean I'm speculating right sure I'm going into this is almost conspiracy theory like stuff sure but you could be stuck with this guy for six weeks it could be a good thing new manager you know they maybe play better more even more goals maybe I don't know all we have is what's in front of us we can't worry about what the what ifs I just feel it is when I step back and think about it and I wondered you know cuz I'd already done the I move last week but I step back and after the performance this week and I realized I didn't I underestimated just and this is the thing about smaller teams you just don't pay attention to them and you and I especially me I like to think of myself as someone who's got a fairly like I watch the bonemouth versus brenford games I care about these small teams in a way that I feel most people don't care I was surprised by how much the fans really turned when they didn't hold on to the win against Palace um so angry and once you start sort of UNL you know digging a bit I'm there's a realistic chance they don't beat Southampton they could sack him because they're kind of running out of like opportunities to fix this because the start of the season was so bad and if a new guy does come in then everything's up for grabs and yeah I take your point they're cheap you could transfer them out but it just it seems weird when there are so many picks at better teams who are at the same price Evan nilson better team same price y better team same price I think for me in particular I have a bit of um what's word nostalgia for Kaa specifically which is why I'm not so keen on Str nson because he did really well for me last year in fbl before he got his injury so I feel that there's a quality player there and he will pull through so I'm happy going with kuna you know I feel honestly I feel he's he's too good for wolves no offense to wolves fans like he's a player who deserves to be in a in a better team so that's why I'm okay Kun now if there was no Kun and only strand last then yeah I will share your your worries I think so I think it's a slight biasness on my side but I get your points there are a lot of options with forwards this year if you if you feel worried about the home manager situation yeah go well back go you know if got a money go Isa go wood go uh ra Humanes so many options you know so that's that's why makes it exciting I feel like the the forward line is the most exciting what is it division position in FPL this year okay fair I think that's that's kind of wrap up because it's one of those where you you're just not going to know the answer for a while last question here from Luke holay and this is probably ties back into coia who do you Captain this week and he wants to ask you to pick between Johnson and coia and I mean I know okay if I had to pick it would be Johnson I think right um I think Spurs a better team than wolves equally good fixtures right both of them are so wolves sof at home Spurs is switch at home equally good fixtures but I would go Brandon Johnson if I had to pick between those two it's interesting you say that because I own Johnson and I haven't considered captaining him at all um whereas I mean if you had to pick between Johnson or k I'm sure you we will go J right well you have go we have go scorer odds on the screen right now from check the chance and I've seen people talk about captaining kuna not it's not a mainstream thing but there are people who are talking about it just because this feels like a week where on paper at least and again you got to bear in mind most people have sold Holland and a lot of people don't own Solan so because a lot of people sold sank last week before the hall so people who don't have either these guys they kind of tempted because they think Salah at home against Villa isn't the easiest fixture I am fine captaining Salah I think it's a good fixture for him Villa were awful yesterday against Bru uh Tyron Mings if he's going to keep picking up the ball in the Box you know I'm I'm happy to keep Salah for that but I mean I just don't think Villa are that solid in defense just consider four goals last week so Salah easy cap for me yeah I agree with that I think Salah like I said earlier on blanked only twice in 10 game weeks six out of those eight returns for double digit H come on it doesn't get safer than this I would consider captaining UMO who at home now I know you don't like this home away things but Ando at home has been has been really good hasn't blanked at home he's like last season's Gorden I guess so I would consider it honestly um at home against bonou I think it's a cheeky differential what's annoying though is that I check I don't know about your mini league guys but I check our mini league sa and more people own UMO in our league than Salah so Salah is a bigger differential of the captain than UMO I'm pretty sure that that's the norm everywhere because ambo is cheaper and so he people have had him since you I had him since game week three most people have had him since then so I think ambo is almost two time played at this point um yeah it's annoying right to say I want a captain in which feel feels differential but actually maybe more of a mainstream move than captaining Salah it it won't it's not I don't think he'll be a popular captaincy pick but definitely a lot of people just own him so the effect won't feel it doesn't feel like sexy my Ando is brenford really blow hot and cold and I take it that they've been great at home at not at home yeah and I'm sure the the Gtech is a feared Fortress for people who don't want to go to a bus stop in the middle of London I mean those who don't know I mean that's that's the comment when brenford first came out this is not a real team just a bus stop in London like there's a lot of disrespect but I don't think Bournemouth is a a great fixture I think it's an fairly decent fixture but it isn't it that that screams to me like a 50-50 fixture and brenford are not a big enough or consistent enough team that I'm willing to bet on captaincy I think I go Salah if you don't have Salah I'd probably gamble on Bruno I'm surprised Bruno is not on this list um because yeah okay and after Bruno i' say but yeah okay so that's us this week uh we kept try to keep it short we will see you next week or the me times get your green arrows guys especially if you don't have Holland and and have been enjoying your green arrows the past few weeks we'll see you next week bye [Music],8052,this thing hello everyone welcome back to the f banger show my name is sila and im joined by sam gw 11 sam and once again this continued thing where you dont own haren and he just keeps not doing the points keeps working for you and now hes even blanking in champions league i know right nd would expect and what a horribly taken penalty as well the curse is working sil all because he told ata to be humble that since then right this man has been true he has scored one goal since that comment in the league anyway and it did you see the sporting game because i found it very weird like its just city again lot of chances a lot of xg but its just its just not for them right now i dont know whats going on sts wise hland is still doing the business right like insane amount of x i think the most x any player has got in the past four weeks the most shots on target and its just some black magic stuff is going on you just cant seem to score since game week five no player has more xg than and holland in the entire league so saa i feel like all this is set up just so that you can say i sold him you would think that right but no see ive held on to him and heres heres why let me let me show you why right okay so youve got you got on the screen you can see hollands run a form and i think a lot of peoples frustration is because if you look at this chart that we have on the screen is they bought him in game six and thats when the blank started for those who started with no hen right and you just know moment you sell him hell start scoring again because what we talking about here were still talking about one of the top three teams in the league yes things have looked bad but de bruy back on the bench midweek you would expect probably 30 minutes this weekend maybe more you dont we dont think of bright is a strong defense home or away i still feel like this is not a place where i want to sell and my maybe this is the wrong analogy to draw but a lot of people dont have salah for all these hard fixtures right where salah scored against chelsea scored against arsenal and the reason is because of these are hard fixtures but you and i discussed this like a few weeks ago the nice thing about premiums is theyre meant to be fixture proof a good premium is worth their price because they can haul in any fixture so hes been bad in these fixtures but hes not been so bad in sens of hes not getting chances hes you can argue to a large degree some regression sure but its also unlucky right the bournemouth game he has a chance from like six yards out same thing against southampton should have scored a hattick like i the more people sell and this is probably i dont know this is not sunken ca fallacy this is like bottom of the ocean fallacy at this point cuz as far as i can see nobody else own this guy but im so tempted to hold on to him because the more people sell him the more i want to keep and i feel like that hall is it just logically this guy cant keep blanking his stats are good at some point its going to tick i dont think this is saka fallacy like i feel like theres some validity to me just holding on i think its not sos fy because the stats back up that hes just underperforming and you would expect him to catch up with his stats right so like i always said i dont think having harand has ever been a bad fpl move it cannot be a bad its just what you do with the remaining funds im happy not owning harand because he has blank but also i have used the funds wisely do what like we said was it last episode you could have gone dcl instead of wood and it wouldnt have made a difference whether they high or not what im saying so it is depends who are you how you getting with all this extra money okay were going to keep having this conversation every week but i suspect at this point im in the minority of people who still want to keep holding but i think hes the most s player this week i think because its its just the most frustrating blank like he needs to score most weeks to make this worth it because he cost that much i would say i would say see what i think most serious fpl players are still keeping him the people selling are mostly casuals i think no man you this is the one of the maybe the positives but also one of the negatives of you not being so plugged into twitter and all this other stuff is unfortunately all the main content creators all the people who everybody follows andy and so on theyve all sold and so people follow the her right so unfortunately its not i wouldnt say it is a casual thing i think its its permeating into serious people again i dont care i hate that i hate that people are fooling my template now you are the template exactly but i dont im not concerned with ownership i generally dont care how much i dont check hollands ownership i dont care about his eo none of those things matter to me its just that i watch the games i feel like this guy is so close to scoring a brace every week that i dont think thats copium i think its just things have events have taken place where hes been unlucky and there been some bad finishing but also just mostly unlucky still getting the chances de brs back and if ive held this long how can i sell when now the guy who i would assume is the solution to all of their problems and now is the time when they fix it and im going to miss out on these halls because i just chickened out at the end okay fair enough fair enough lets see another red hour for me this week with this guy when he blanks you did well we both no we scor the same points we on this part we only do green arrows unlike the rest of your content creators we have salah we captain salah and we have all the other guys around them to get points you got to go from madison so he scor in like two how many minutes did he play eight minutes eight minute c and you still got a go gods are on my side what can i say gods on definitely on your side but speaking of madison and that price range of midfielders we had a question here from fbl hs good friend of the port is it time for bruno and nice fixtures portuguese manager coming in bruno fernandez already back on the score sheet last week thanks to robert sanchez but still we pen goals are still goals sam you texted me the second tenha got sa to say its time for bruno so i assume youve already got him in u i think that was that semi sarcastic s i would say wait i have very low confidence on all united assets right now even with a new manager coming in he may be a good pick but we dont know for sure and im willing to wait a little bit but the issue with waiting is the fixtures are good now like if youre going to go in on united your window is the next three right weve got it on the screen now mhm arsenal forest and city from gaming 14 onwards you dont want to touch those so you need to go in now for leester if swit and everton its either now or never if you ask me need to go in now you tell me united fan or is it because youre a united fan youre so burned so pessimistic this is e manager since ferguson and you pretty much exactly like what you said i just have such low confidence on united assets even with a manager weve gone through so many managers didnt make that much of a difference so i still bad to me the same problem still happen against chelsea right creating chances cant finish like you said brunos goal was somewhat lucky if that never happened would you even be discussing bruno right now same problems are still there any other united is there would you feel safer if you went slightly cheaper maybe hland up top or gacho a lot of united fans seemed very frustrated with gacho at one point i think casmiro shouts at him right because he messes up a chance against chelsea but he getting in good positions theres always two sides to a coin right so there one side thats its like hes getting into good positions at least so thats a positive to be seen the negative is that hes getting good positions but hes wasting all of the chances with back with bad final product so two sides so coin i still think gacho is our most dangerous player and if there was a united player that i would get it would be gacho but right now i just wouldnt get any hland because its i think its a forward and theres just so many possible forwards you can get right now so not too keen on hland right now youre not enticed by lester and ipswitch in particular right lets look at these three fixtures right lester have been bad all season they scraped a point against iwit last week like last kick of the game jordan a sc by then iwi should have closed the game i themselves dont defend very well and then everton lost to southampton how bad do you have to be to lose to southampton me okay i have very little faith in united saa so i could be wrong runo could score like five goals in the next three games but i dont know i think its just you should not ask a united fan this question im pessimistic on my own team i think as a nonunited fan i think bruno a very reasonable pick this week i think these three fixtures are as good as it gets as long as youve got an exit plan in gameing 14 i think you can go in i honestly would consider even highland i would consider gacho i would even consider dalo you can get an attacking defender i will consider united defender that i would consider because uniteds defense has been quietly solid despite what i think we talked about it few weeks back about how like in the top defender rankings there are a lot of united defenders its just there people get caught up with the memes and all that i think theyve been solid okay so united defense your down so if i do dalo this week youre youre cool with that because im quite keen bearing in mind and of course its risky because new manager coming in but ruben amarim likes to play with wing backs now he did say that he cant do everything he does in spotting the same way at united and you could argue united is probably not built to accommodate that system but it feels like somebody like dalo maybe im oversimplifying the same thing with bruno right but portuguese guy portuguese coach very attacking plays for the national team feels and gets forward right so dalo feels like an interesting pick and the pick that most people wont go for i agree there is a bit of i think the wing backs are question mark right now for united cuz we dont have wing backs you could play dalo could play masi whos going to be a left wing back there talks that maybe hell push rashford or gacho back will he will he play just invert doo as a left wing back like there are a lot of when it comes to wing backs so i personally am not touching any united player right now okay so in united is just too uncertain because even if the fixtures are good the change in manager and the thing is whoever is vanoy will take this game and then after its amarim for and everton and maybe that is just too uncertain switching froming back four for years and suddenly playing with a back five how will the defense handle it will there be a transition period all that stuff i too much uncertainty keep im im not going near them and maybe also you couple with the fact that we got an international break after 11 so you dont know what injuries and also couple the fact that this is a very short fix your run its just the next three so if you dont already own maybe this isnt long enough to justify a hold because the 14 15 16 are bad you want to play arsenal you dont want to play forest and you dont want to play city you would have to imagine city by both aral city away as well its like its pretty much two of the toughest fixtures you could get and for all arsenal and citys current problems you imagine by 14 15 16 theyll have fixed that so maybe again because we im sure that the temptation of bruno sure its united fans sure its fixtur sure its new manager high but also it is his price we always think about people based on prices we hold them up to their price we like guys because hes 8m it sounds nice maybe the right answer here if youre looking for a midfielder second in the sticker that we have on the screen right now bournemouth anon sano surely thats the simple pick that isnt sexy because a lot of people owned and a lot of people sold right cuz when he started blanking or he didnt return people just got rid but back in the goals last week 10p pointer man at the match performance against city like good right that goal especially so much composure they play brenford brighton wolves spurs ips west ham and if you if you ask me would you rather have a wolves attacker wolves at top of the sticker or bonemouth attacker surely youd want bournemouth that depends so like for wolves i only consider their forwards they dont have any viable midfield picks no and for bon is i consider s so it works out well you could have the both of the best of both worlds seanu in the midfield str l alun as a forward you say that but i think evan nelsons been picking up recently evan is an option too as well hes been good hes been good i brought in k last and im happy with that and with the fixture run coming up i continue to be happy i think so come back to my point right if you need a midfielder this week why isnt it to menu why isnt seano the high pick this week why are people just going i think seano i think seo will be a good pick because sano nailed 90 minutes plays every week is talisman full of the attack if they score hes likely to be involved and these are un objectively these are good fixtures brenford cant defend i feel bad for fen owners but that what happened on monday night the most objectively funny thing if you dont own fen right cuz he went what at 90 minutes he had 12 points and by 96 minutes he had four brenford just cant defend i saw that game and fulham should have scored long before that so many chances brighton we know their issues wolves cant defend you saw the palace game im already regretting i nri like i watched this game and thought like how stupid i have to be these people give up chances for fun and no i knew its always been you dont youre not getting any clean sheet he just hoping for attacking returns and by far he is maybe the most attacking defender in the league its true but palace came there came to wolves with no a no waton and they still had that many chances it shouldnt be that easy and both the goals are basic like school boy setpiece errors so that doesnt board well for ws defense but its great for bournemouth spurs we know spurs ipswitch cant defend west ham if they havent sacked ly by game 16 id be surprised but bottom line this feels like a almost a nobrainer for sanu and my guess is that hes not as hyped because people just didnt get the returns they wanted earlier or they bought after all the returns and so now theyre just not interested in going back or i more likely its a price point thing to me hes just too cheap like if he was 8m theyd pick him over bruno but because hes 5m eh let me spend more money get bruno maybe i like the piig i think and i think there is a lack of options in the midfield the non premum midfields so like saka salah palmer sun like all these guys are good they have been returning sun maybe a bit less because its been injured but the rest of them theyve been good but then you go below right earlier in the season we had diaz and all these guys but all of them has fell off diaz yes i know hes got a hatrick midweek so he should start but how long will that last right he starts this week he gets benched next week you got the spurs now medon lost his place i need to get medison out my team got johnson who scored but i think the recent weeks have shown us that sp are very unreliable you target them for the easy fixtures and they dont return and they return just too inconsistent so theres a real lack of midfielders i would say right now seo looks good im happy to go with seo i may do medicine to se but you have convinced me maybe i came i came prepared today okay b with kit and all that because i feel like its definitely a price point thing and i think a lot of reas has to do because people sold holland they have so much money now and so i cant be spending five million on a midfielder whereas i still have harand so im still bothered people dont have rogers i saw people benching rogers last week and again weve how many times have we had to say this morgan rogers is not vable he is a hes a starter agreed are there any other since were on midfielders we spent so much time on mids are there any other mids worth looking at not too many every other m so the midfielders are just uninspiring right now slim pickings right its its funny how things change salah you want to have salah i think you cra by the way i think anyone who still does not have salah right is youre youre playing f wrong cuz he has anet that in 10 game weeks has only blanked twice so blank twice has eight weeks of returns out of those eight weeks one was a six pointer one was a nine pointer and the remaining six were all double digit halls what more do you want from an what more do you i think the people who dont have salah unfortunately are the people who have kept trent and have kept holland and all that so i thought di will be able to cover salah that thing hey you mock but i would love to have diaz this week this week but you wouldnt the past few weeks no but slot put diaz up front this week hatrick and he said diaz is my starting guy going forward things can change but if lis diaz keeps starting tempting again international break after this unfortunately so hell be on another flight to barania or somewhere in columbia somewhere far away its going to get benched for southampton of course hes going to get benched for southampton why am i even discussing this okay lets lets move midfield theres not many other options bowen youre not going to hold much longer because this team will sack this coach at some point maybe thats the key thats when you go into b but you wait unlike you im not so down on spurs but im happy that i just own brandon johnson thats the level of investment im willing to put in this team because theyre so inconsistent i think its one those like if you went in already you might as well keep especially switch coming up however if you were fresh will you buy a sp player right now i dont know okay lets explore that right maybe not convinced hey lets lets lets explore that right because they play this week and i suspect a lot of people will be looking at sun and solan because were fickle people and solan just one week ago everyone was like solan is so bad but those are the solank owners right those are the ones who feel like it was going bad again people who didnt own i didnt own you didnt own we didnt care it wasnt something i wasnt worrying about it but two goals in the last 50 minutes and if switch is it tempting to go are you allowed to take one we punts anymore in this game or because now we got five transfers you cant do that and you just got to ignore spurs at home against z switch i think i think it is a decent part you got it swit at home then city away which seems hard but city has been considering every game right like not saying theyre going to win the game but is there a chance thats first score i think so pretty decent chance and then you go back to fulam home bond m away chelsea home s anon away so not the best fix i say is mixed and its reflected here in the fixure list they right in the middle so up and down but im okay with johnson im not too sure about sando though because his minutes has been severely managed he came off at 55 55th minute last weekend so im a bit concerned there i dont know how long itll take for him to be able to get up to speed not happy taking the risk of sun at this moment right now despite a great fixture coming up my only concern is the fact that we are recording this on thursday morning they play galatasaray tonight spurs and i dont think and just going to rest or rotate that much although its just the europa league because hes still under a little bit of pressure and rich charons out injured so solan probably has to play 90 and then quick turnaround sunday fixture against switch its one of those if you own great but if you dont own id be tempted to just swerve okay fair enough midfielders are boring s lets move away from the midfielders lets talk about forwards because we did have questions here again fbl h but i think this is a question for everybody welbeck or jao pedro ja pedro flags removed back in training ive held this guy for like six weeks just randomly on my bench hes its all set up for him to come in come on as a sub and score the winner against city right but well back with his track record that hes done the past few weeks i if i had to pick one right now like fresh going in i would pick well back its insane its a bad fixture this week against city but then after that great fixtures right so and whats the price difference between them now wellex 59 whats j 55 so its not that big we have money right we all saw holland we have money now i will go el back hes the third highest scoring in the game it is crazy the fact that because wells not a template not definitely not a pick amongst the content creators so therefore hes not in and heres a step for you see hes only blank three times this season in 10 game weeks six his minutes are good right like hes playing constantly 70 plus 80 plus each week its not like if hes coming off at halftime its not as if hes coming off on 60 hes not getting injured hes not going to go away for the international break because england think theyre better than danny welbeck i it doesnt matter hes who cares if hes 32 he should he should be walking into this england squad but theyll pick watkins instead i go danny w in fact heavily considering daniel w next week this feels like too harsh of a jumping in point right now against city but next week is it you could arue city has lost blah three games in a row all that stuff im just saying it like if i were to fresh i wouldnt pick this week next week though looks good well im just saying that city just conceded a hatrick against someone who used to play for brighton who was not respected thats true thats true but he come on you cant say that hes the same player now and then right like what hes been doing the p thats been in im sure like if welbeck was watching yoker score the hatrick and thought brighton man he can do it me danny welbeck united legend ara legend preston legend all the watford legend all the other teams hes played no reason why well cant score this week i think its one of those if its its timately we are boring people so its transer we wont make this week we will wait one more week just because we are boring people in vc its not green on the fixture so therefore we wont go but city have been so poor defensively what are we waiting for consider four midweek they consider two against bmer dont keep clean sheets dont look solid no rry what are we waiting for here true thats true i con your point sa im going to bring well back this week now my problem saa is that i like my forward line i have k i have wood i have r who has playing the past two weeks since i brought him in after not after scoring like five in a row but i dont i dont want to take out any of them and i wouldnt i wouldnt take out k this week i wouldnt take r himz there have been some unlucky blanks but bottom line what still a very good fixture this week and i wouldnt get rid of definely not taking out chriswood thats for sure chriswood the best forward in the in the world right now why would you take him out so we have to rename our podcast as the chris wood lovers club we were we were chriswood lovers before other people we we loved wood you guys did we got wood before everyone else and people still dont want to get wood they feel like its the fixtures are too hard and people just being soft as far as i can see no fixture is too hard for chris im happy to keep honestly this run for forest looks a bit tricky right newcastle arsenal ips city ive not even once considered selling chris wood i think the more interesting question is do you invest in forest defense now or have you missed the chance because all other defenses dont seem to keep clean sheets anyway m thats true thats true defense such a mindfield i wouldnt say its a mindfield now its just a barren death in which no one is doing anything forest defenders as well yes they return this week but theyve had was it four clean shits this season which is isnt that good objectively its just good compared to everyone else right which is good mean is a cheap second best defense in the league what more do you want thats true although fixure standing i dont know how many cles is going to keep against arsenal city all these teams coming up forest has been surprising for us especially since you were so pessimistic on them at the start of the season i bought the hype everyone thought forest were going down i listen to too many podcasts know non fpl stuff and everyone was very negative on forest i think even forest fans were quite negative coming into the season they didnt sign anybody and if you think back to start of the season it feels like a long time ago there was a lot of dis because they didnt get ena because they bid for ena they missed out on him and everyones like were going to the season with chris wood thats it of course well ed get seven games in not a single goal hindsight 2020 right no goals no assist for nk and chris wood meanwhile best striker in the country if you needed to make a defensive transfer this week and if im being honest with myself i do because my defense is awful but i like you probably just accept it nobody gets clean sheets anyway you dont even know whos going to get a clean so why am i wasting time rearranging deck chairs on the titanic thing thats a thats a good analogy z reing deck chairs on the titanic i like that exactly its its a matter of time before they all do their clean sheets anyway so why bother but allaa very tempting hes not going to score bangers every week and his explanation for why he scored this week was hilarious he just said as naked m so i just i just thought i hit it i saw that i saw that but even all even you leave aside all alex moreno whos we liked at villa getting consistent minutes now good assist this week matt sells has been great im so tempting just to weve liked milenovic whos been unlucky not to score so far mhm if you had a defensive transfer to make it just feels again arsenal ips and new cle next it just feels logically again one of those things right you just look at the fixtures and you cant bring yourself to do this even though they probably will get a clean in one of these two agreed i think for us its probably like the only defense you i wouldnt even use the word target but could feel somewhat positively towards well you said united defense so that is your if youre going in for a defender this week right y thats would you would you spend and get onana or thats going too far no honestly i think onana is a good pick in fpl this year because united been cing so many shots hes been having a lot of saves so when we do keep clean sheets it speaks byself hes whats he top second in the goalkeeper rankings only behind met cell and then sanchez is dead so i goalkeeper rankings are weird now and pope is fourth despite all the that we give newcast has been playing bad this year so who knows whats happening speaking of newcastle right again is this this is probably a very decent week to go in right for us the way okay its a fixure they could theoretically i think isak is a its an interesting option right now im still not convinced by the defense but isak is isaking right now so goals back to back i think isak could be a tricky option to go in the next gaming 12 onwards looks good for isach and you say the defense is not where youd go but i think louis hall i had him in game week one and im annoyed cemented his place hes finally getting his just rewards and he i thought he managed saka very well last week still cheap looks nailed and these are good fixtures from gaming 12 onwards okay and thats probably why you dont go highland because isaks just a level above un if be slightly more expensive is a tasty differential i would say right now might have to sell harer next week dont like this okay very anyway okay so thats most of the people if you are buying a woles forward this week i think this is an interesting question to me anyway because i dont i dont have a woles forward yet you say so much but str lson cheaper here and there but k is central to the attacking i think hes the talisman of the team to me he always one the talisman do you want the guy who runs around a lot and passes to the guy who is going to score or do you want the guy who scores but hes also scoring k also scores its not like hes a pure assist so he scores he assist its good for bonus points because hes doing so much right lets okay lets break this out i think one of the reasons why im a little wary of kuna and i feel better about stran l and this going to sound silly because the prices arent that far apart but it is one mil wolves you have holland thats fine thats thats part of it that to be fair when you have harand and salah and palmer like i do funds always tight so that is one point ill concede that but another point is also wolves have one win in 20 games were in our were in our fpl bubble so we dont care because when none of us are wolves fans we dont care about this club they its a transactional relationship that we have with them getting them in for a few nice green fixtures get rid of them but if you listen to i listen to a few wes podcast this week and i was surprised by just how much these people hate the club they hate the owners and they hate the manager and they w him sacked yesterday and that worries me a little bit i dont think the bulls owners care about any of this theyve not invested that much in recent times anyway i feel in the club but the big issue for me is that if they do sack this guy cuz one win in 20 does sound bad you can cut it no matter how hard the fixtures have been if they sack him next week and the new guy comes in and doesnt like kias face doesnt like strand lson because hes too tall and you keep looking up to talk to him i dont know could be anything right and then youve bought these guys where and you had danny welbeck right there nailed 59 for a much better team you had chris wood slightly more expensive for a much better team also neil you had ral herz again id say a better team you had yan wia also better team all of these guys safer picks better teams managers who are not likely to get sacked next week why are we messing about with ws players i think its just the fixtures right were blinded by the fixtures maybe and i think those are valid concerns saa but how can you predict when a man will be sacked or not right all you got is what you have in front of you and i think the fact that theyre all similar price points like okay you could bring in a ws player they play against south at home hopefully some goals there and then manager get sack lets say they lose to southon like i dont know 43 like that he gets sack in the next week you can easily just move them off cu the chip you can move them to well back you can move them to whoever it is but youre not going to do that right youre going to stick it out for these next six while a new magic im speculating right sure im going into this is almost conspiracy theory like stuff sure but you could be stuck with this guy for six weeks it could be a good thing new manager they maybe play better more even more goals maybe i dont know all we have is whats in front of us we cant worry about what the what ifs i just feel it is when i step back and think about it and i wondered cuz id already done the i move last week but i step back and after the performance this week and i realized i didnt i underestimated just and this is the thing about smaller teams you just dont pay attention to them and you and i especially me i like to think of myself as someone whos got a fairly like i watch the bonemouth versus brenford games i care about these small teams in a way that i feel most people dont care i was surprised by how much the fans turned when they didnt hold on to the win against palace so angry and once you start unl digging a bit im theres a realistic chance they dont beat southampton they could sack him because theyre running out of like opportunities to fix this because the start of the season was so bad and if a new guy does come in then everythings up for grabs and i take your point theyre cheap you could transfer them out but it just it seems weird when there are so many picks at better teams who are at the same price evan nilson better team same price y better team same price i think for me in particular i have a bit of whats word nostalgia for kaa specifically which is why im not so keen on str nson because he did well for me last year in fbl before he got his injury so i feel that theres a quality player there and he will pull through so im happy going with kuna i feel honestly i feel hes hes too good for wolves no offense to wolves fans like hes a player who deserves to be in a in a better team so thats why im okay kun now if there was no kun and only strand last then i will share your worries i think so i think its a slight biasness on my side but i get your points there are a lot of options with forwards this year if you if you feel worried about the home manager situation go well back go if got a money go isa go wood go ra humanes so many options so thats thats why makes it exciting i feel like the forward line is the most exciting what is it division position in fpl this year okay fair i think thats thats wrap up because its one of those where youre just not going to know the answer for a while last question here from luke holay and this is probably ties back into coia who do you captain this week and he wants to ask you to pick between johnson and coia and i know okay if i had to pick it would be johnson i think right i think spurs a better team than wolves equally good fixtures right both of them are so wolves sof at home spurs is switch at home equally good fixtures but i would go brandon johnson if i had to pick between those two its interesting you say that because i own johnson and i havent considered captaining him at all whereas if you had to pick between johnson or k im sure you we will go j right well you have go we have go scorer odds on the screen right now from check the chance and ive seen people talk about captaining kuna not its not a mainstream thing but there are people who are talking about it just because this feels like a week where on paper at least and again you got to bear in mind most people have sold holland and a lot of people dont own solan so because a lot of people sold sank last week before the hall so people who dont have either these guys they tempted because they think salah at home against villa isnt the easiest fixture i am fine captaining salah i think its a good fixture for him villa were awful yesterday against bru tyron mings if hes going to keep picking up the ball in the box im im happy to keep salah for that but i just dont think villa are that solid in defense just consider four goals last week so salah easy cap for me i agree with that i think salah like i said earlier on blanked only twice in 10 game weeks six out of those eight returns for double digit h come on it doesnt get safer than this i would consider captaining umo who at home now i know you dont like this home away things but ando at home has been has been good hasnt blanked at home hes like last seasons gorden so i would consider it honestly at home against bonou i think its a cheeky differential whats annoying though is that i check i dont know about your mini league guys but i check our mini league sa and more people own umo in our league than salah so salah is a bigger differential of the captain than umo im pretty sure thats the norm everywhere because ambo is cheaper and so he people have had him since you i had him since game week three most people have had him since then so i think ambo is almost two time played at this point its annoying right to say i want a captain in which feel feels differential but maybe more of a mainstream move than captaining salah it wont its not i dont think hell be a popular captaincy pick but definitely a lot of people just own him so the effect wont feel it doesnt feel like sexy my ando is brenford blow hot and cold and i take it that theyve been great at home at not at home and im sure the gtech is a feared fortress for people who dont want to go to a bus stop in the middle of london those who dont know thats thats the comment when brenford first came out this is not a real team just a bus stop in london like theres a lot of disrespect but i dont think bournemouth is a great fixture i think its an fairly decent fixture but it isnt it that screams to me like a 5050 fixture and brenford are not a big enough or consistent enough team that im willing to bet on captaincy i think i go salah if you dont have salah id probably gamble on bruno im surprised bruno is not on this list because okay and after bruno i say but okay so thats us this week we kept try to keep it short we will see you next week or the me times get your green arrows guys especially if you dont have holland and have been enjoying your green arrows the past few weeks well see you next week bye,7532

FBO blackbox ahead of gameweek 11 my name is asz and look at that Mark we are bang on time for the first time I don't know God knows BL is so surprised I look at pangy in there oh my God that's on time it's it's the new it's a new software we're using which is a lot Slicker means I'm a bit calmer I didn't throw any headphones this week I had to get a new webcam though because my webcam broke last night you so nearly did a whole week of like no stress and then last night it's as my webcam is broken I need to get an order on I don't if it's going to arrive in time it's so oh here we go it was it was so tranquil nothing straightforward It Anyway thecam minutes before 10 minutes before we start we're in we're on time beautiful green arrows as well come on go you've closed the Gap though haven't you massive week for you massive we'll talk about that in a bit what else are we going to talk about tonight we got we we got some stuff on Amar we talk about his new tactics what we can expect three amazing fixures for them uh coming up so we'll talk a bit about those I've already got one in my side I might be getting another one so we'll see see uh what what tonight brings uh on that we got to talk about big Dom big Dom sanki getting his 16o return making a lot of people very happy Near making me very sad cuz I do you know how close I was to selling him have I told you I know oh I can't believe it you were going to do what you were going to do Dom to Ry gimenez right yeah I was going to do Dom to gimenez and I had it on confirmed transfers and I did a poll uh I did a poll on Twitter which which said something like who scores more than X2 salanki or gimenez and I think it it was like 65% him Anders people said seriously yeah and uh I looked it and I thought there's lots I could do with that money I want to be moving to Palmer in the future you know salah's obviously a player that I want I can take some money out and and go for him and is I I would be sick to my stomach if I had done that move so glad I didn't I'd be I'd be I'd be beating you if you'd have done that you would be yeah my godar me imagine that I can't believe you were that close to doing it as well I I we did talk about it didn't we because we talked about salanki last week and you said you on the verge of giving up on him and I said I said we got to hold him for the h switch game surely and and aren't we glad we did because now he goes into that game as what I looked at the betting odds that Rob T put up and he's like the third favorite scorer this game week and yeah our teams look pretty good with salanki in there um so yeah commiserations to anyone who mov this week is he you going to cat on him right spoiler early spoiler know I know come from uh G from selling him to Captain it's a funny old game and if you look at the fixures he's had you know Brighton West Ham you know I switch to come the game that I didn't hold out much H for was this was this Villa game and it seemed like The Logical one to sell him on but you called it last time you said Villa have looked a bit a bit ropey um you know struggling a bit with with the Champions League uh you know the underlying stats in defense were good but starting to Tire a bit and I thought Spurs were were brilliant in that match and and rightfully blew them away so oh it should be a big I mean you've got three Spurs assets going into whips Swit I know I me it's funny isn't it because last week when I got porro and Johnson in it looked like I've made a fa Parkers obviously they went to Paris and they were miserable I didn't expect the returns I didn't expect big returns in the Paris game but I thought I might get something but it was always with the vi the home games in mind um the three home games that they got in four and but I wasn't expecting the big returns in the Villa game so it'd be just like it would be spursy wouldn't it if they like Drew one and yeah lip swis s got the goal or something yeah yeah surely not uh we have got over 400 joining us already and there's European football going on and Chelsea what they what six seven8 nil up by now I don't know they were 6 n up after 42 minutes against the uh Armenian minnows that they were playing six nil at halim yeah exactly no Cole Palmer in that game of course we will all touch on Cole palmer but just to give a shout out to those uh in the chat tonight thank you for joining us that's Paul signs that's Henn fbl Forest you sexy beast Nicholas kill Tristan Cox Tony G Mr Lucian emu show Connor Richardson I am 1974 at a boy FBO yellow Army good evening um Davis Family First Tony G J keeg they're all in tanky no sign of Nigel yet I'm sure he's there in the background just hasn't commented yet thank you for joining us uh on a Thursday night 9:00 we'll be going up to probably 11: knowing us maybe a little bit more if there's any super chats in there we will get to them of course of course let's get on with this by hitting your game week Mr as your first 53 points talk us through it God you're really getting into this like streamer hosting lck you reading reading names hitting my team I can't wait till the smash and like yeah actually I I'll do a bit of that in a minute off to go uh yeah t is all right week 53 points uh ryer and Trent the two premium Defenders who a lot of people have got obviously disappointing kind of each and every week uh with with three and two uh with the one Moreno finally actually making past the halfway line was was was was nice to see and Ana on the on the other side it's nice to see the fullbacks finally doing a bit of bit of attacking it was Moreno's best display from an attacking point of view obviously had an amazing display against Salah anfield but going forward uh last weekend he was just yeah very confident taking players on it was great to see it looks like he's like really enjoying being in the side isn't he like you see his celebrations after the games and he's like acting for the players and there obviously real quality like there and I think with Ana as well on the other side they're there's no reason why they should be Shackled because they can offer a lot going forward so I think Moreno at 44 um is is a good purchase I think if you offer me the the switch to to Ana I'd probably take it he's a little bit more but um I'm pretty happy with Mor how minkovich didn't score though oh no we'll talk about him later right he had one past the post and then the brilliant sa by fabianski for the one that Anderson play back to him I mean it's coming for him for sure yeah uh the the issue with my defense though was was I I bought in leaf Davis to play him uh in in in two games what you thinking here tell talk me through the logic of that you B you have leave Davis surely you have to play him in the home games yeah well the logic was I'm not I'm going to play Trent on I Trent's obviously going to play I'm G to play Moreno at home to West Ham so there was one spot and it was between LS Gabrielle and and Davis but did you really think that City would keep a clean sheet at Bournemouth I two clean sheets at all season I didn't think any three of them would and the the the the issue was I mean I just thought it was I just thought it was a loss it was probably which one has probably the best chance of the clean sheet in these three and I thought it' probably see but when you're talking about Leaf Davis it's got to be who's the best one for attacking returns is it if you didn't think take clean sheets out of it who's more likely to get you an attack in return Leaf Davis or or L okay if you if you if you if you can tell me that you were expecting Leaf Davis to score a left footed volley from the corner of theen area into into the into the corner I mean basically it happened what I mean they all concede it that's kind of what I thought would would happen and I think it was it's just a lottery isn't it I mean Lewis could have scored a goal if he'd started from from outside the penalty era Gabrielle could have headed one in from a set piece I don't know it was it was a mistake is top for chances created of all Defenders yeah but they haven't got any Strikers that can score yeah I'll give you that I don't know it was it was probably it was probably the wrong move I it was the wrong move give the points um and I I wish I had played him because I you know I I bought I literally had him for the these two games I had him for everon at home and Lester they were the two games I was going to play him in and I went went against that uh thing but so yeah that's nine points lost which which does hurt but anyway uh played Rogers though played Rogers yeah played Rogers I was I was happy with that with his with his nine uh foden I mean again I don't know how he blanked in in that match he's he's now the second highest for XG um involvement over over the last two game weeks just behind Harland who also planked again uh inuma garach I mean how did Garo not get a return against against Chelsea because he's very wasteful that's why yeah I know but oh my God he had two great chances in that game uh harand blanked I don't know how he blanked in that Watkins had a great one-onone opportunity against Spurs and put it wide and luckily I was bailed out by by sanki cuz without him with Salah scoring and kind of other things going on it wouldn't have been a very good week so yeah it was it was a funny week it was a week where I think it could have been better if i' played Davis foden got something gach got something yeah ifs woods and buts but Green Arrow Fen had that chance second half that he put wide it was a good shot that yeah and and he's you know he scored in midweek of course so it's coming for foden there's no doubt um it's just how long you hold him really against the options out he's got one more week one more week for me uh heroic doses says as if it makes you feel better I did play Davis but I bench salanki oh bench salanki I don't think that makes me feel better makes me feel a bit makes me feel a bit sick Mr or Mrs doses what did you have up front that meant you bench salanki I want to know we all want to know put that in chat I'll look out for it let's bring my team up Shelby because it's a green arrow it's a big one 75 do we have to fleen oh fleen we're talk we talk about him shall we I mean that was absolutely painful some some fbl gold between us though wasn't it because um when he when the clean sheet went in you said to me you know when when do you think he'll break your heart and it was inevitable I was like well it always what always happens is you wait until they got maximum bonus and that's when they concede you wait until they hit Peak points and he got maximum bonus and then he started getting more saves and he was on for 12 conceded one only fell to eight and I was like you know what I'll take the eight three bonus with the 10 say perfect and I thought to myself the only way he's going to lose the free bonus now is if he lets another one in and this is with what 30 seconds to go yeah and they played another minute of stoppage time and he let the second one in it was funny watching because because obiously you've got him I haven't and I went for Ray I'm paying more and it's been painful owning owning Ry over the last few and I was I kind of joked you I sent you the message and said oh how long till fleen loses it and as the game started going on I started getting more and more nervous that it wasn't going to happen and he was just going to go on and get this absolutely Mammoth Hall and I don't know when when when they scored it was funny cuz because you you'd said to me when's he going to [ __ ] the pet and then you were watching the stream but you're a little bit ahead of me and so then I just got the message from you saying yep he's absolutely sh and then literally as I read it I saw him concede and I was like oh oh believable yeah it was I I was kind of prepared for it so it wasn't as devastating as perhaps it would be for others and obviously I'd had a good game we so I could take it if I had a bad way game week I think I'd have had to say to pip uh i' just go out we need some more milk or something then just gone for a walk for two hours at like 10:00 at night you know just invented a reason to get out the house and be alone I mean there there must be people out there who you know if you didn't have slanking if you didn't have Salah um maybe even have Johnson bench I'm sure there's going to be people out there who had you know Rogers on the bench sorry not Johnson Rogers on the bench no salanki no Salah and had fleen and saw that Hall and saw the Green Arrow and was like thank God I got a player bringing something home and then yeah oh sorry if that's you dear me anyway fleen four Trent two Gabrielle 2 porro one miserable in defense Ino 3 and here it comes Rogers nine Johnson 8 Salo 18 seeno Chow was the captain of course seeno 10 Harland two salanki 16 obviously the fact that I played seeno over Lewis raised a few eyebrows and of course raised suspicions of oh we got a leak I I I knew people think that the thing is I was on the train to notam I had no signal and I was like try to get a signal to message in WhatsApp and say oh people are going to think this aren't they when when uh basically I just like all the team news was coming in and so on and I was like I was surprised that more people didn't play so many I was surprised how many teams did bench de bench him um yeah I was pretty shocked that I was he was such a differential because I always thought City would concede and then like who's most likely get the goal but what was funny one of the reasons I played him and this is I shouldn't be affected by this but I was on you know on Friday night I was waiting for the Embargo team news to come through and it came through from Pep about oh I've got a few injuries so that spooked me a bit and I thought well we don't know who those injuries are and he he said to like you'll find out or something I was like brilliant thank you very much so I I didn't think Lewis would be injured but I thought that perhaps there'd be more injuries and then City more likely to concede so I thought yeah I'll play some meno if they're going to be weakened but the other thing that made me play him was um there was a interview with him on BBC on the BBC website which I presume was on Football Focus and on it he talked about setting a goal Target and and you know when it's just recency biased I watched it and thought yeah actually he's a good player and he yeah he could get fit and I was I was talking myself into playing him and that's that was played into it as well and it's just weird out those little things like if you read an article or someone you know there someone just brings a player to mind you could be on Twitter could you just bre through Twitter and that could be the thing that just makes you go when it's so close and it was I mean like the difference between seeno Rogers Lewis when I looked and Gabrielle when I looked at review because I was looking at review and they were all about between 3 four 37 expected points but when it's like that it's like well you know it's down to me really there's not there's not enough in it where the algor the model going to help so yeah I just went on my biases which was well I don't trust pep and I think City will City will let one in at least and they let two in so two two things on that uh firstly you could have you know given me the tip off that Lewis was benched that would have been I didn't know he was Bench did I oh yeah yeah of course you didn't yeah yeah you think I'm that I'm glad City wasn't the first kickoff because it would have been even worse wouldn't it imagine if we both bench Lewis imagine if I had bench Lewis for uh for Davis would have got absolutely slated for for for being in the the the old cartel um I wanted to ask say say for example you had to play Lewis this week because obviously you've got no GED to um say Gabrielle was a was a d okay actually doesn't really work with this example but say you were playing Lewis this week would that make you less likely to want to play seeno oh what if I was playing Lewis and seeno in the same yeah it would because I hate that I hate so do I so that was the other Factor it was like I was always going to play Gabrielle over Lewis because I felt the goal threat from Gabrielle is far greater and I thought that E I thought well maybe Arsenal will concede City will concede so it's then go threat so it's always Gabrielle and I I was pretty certain he was going to play Gabrielle I don't think there was I don't think there was much doubt going into the game week that Gabriel was going to start based on what we'd heard and what arteta had said not that you can trust arteta but so it was never a choice between Gabriel and Lou it was always do I go three at the back or four at the back and bench seeno so it's or leou that's the nine points that I lost out on on my leaf days yeah I just don't don't get why you we've Le I guess it was it which not likely to score is what were your think because I played him at home to Everton and they lost 3-0 that that was that was honestly that was the fixture right yeah I should have I I I yeah it's not okay we're on your team now we don't need to do the whole thing on on Lea Davis but yeah that is going to sting I think for a while that that move but when I I can't I can't so I just I can't believe pep said uh one player we can't rest is Ric yeah it's funny everyone said didn't they in the week oh that means he's benched for sure I didn't really think that I I didn't think for one minute Lewis wouldn't start it was just most likely get me some points but I was surprised how many played Lewis and how many owned some meno I sold a lot of people sold seeno as well he was a mwe for Palmer and yeah yeah so I was surprised he was such a differential when when I got a signal and I finally flick in through teams I was like oh blame me actually s meno could work out and he did which was great so yeah last a bit of luck yeah I mean he is the dominant player for them and it's a good time to look at the ticker I mean Balmer fixtures Now brenford Brighton wolves those three in particular very very strong from an attacking standpoint they'll probably concede but having seeno for those for that Run's pretty good and it doesn't you know they're fifth on the ticker here over the next 12 I say who really impressed me that was kirz with a two yeah he was yeah cuz I I had him I had him last season do you remember when everyone went for zabani and I was like oh I'll take the punt on on kirz that'll be fun misses out in the first double game week zabani scores and then they then they concede that was yeah so you talk you talk about there's little things like kirkus I look at him think you you let me down that time it wasn't even it's not his fault he didn't get picked you know but I still look at him think that was that was your fault but yeah I think kirk' stats are really good we we going to talk about a bit later but he's another one four 43 is there's some decent options emerging around like the four the four fiveish bracket and and the thing is it's like no clean sheets but I think you've got to just consider the attack and return potential now there's no clean sheets anywhere no no I mean not even Arsenal now as we're we're going to touch on um it's it's now about you know which which Defenders are most likely to get you something in the in the attacking third um because finding Defenders who can actually get you clean sheet I mean like in fact you know vardia was now described as the better option over Lewis which is crazy because it's like it's leis is cheaper and so he's the cheaper route into the city defense but because all we care about really is attacking returns because we've given up on clean sheets you go bario and it's it's weird it if like people saying now which city Defender they'd say AIO even though he cost more because because Lewis is really only getting you clean sheets he might get assists you'll probably get one goal maybe two over the season but V is unquestionably the more attacking of those two and now that's all we really care about because was it two clean sheets for City and I don't think they're coming anytime soon Brighton Spurs Liverpool they're not going to keep a clean sheet in any of them games I don't think no and is a problem with Lewis because you know he's he's 4.7 4.8 um he's his place is at risk each week I mean I expect him to play most games but he he will get the odd he he will he will miss the OD game when when Walker comes in um he hasn't got as good attacking threat as some of the Defenders around his priz and he's not keeping clean sheets as well so it's the thing I'm kind of playing him each week because he's a man city Defender I'm trying to I'm thinking okay this is statistically one of the best defenders in the league and obviously one of the best teams in the league and it's I'm I'm losing out to players like Leaf Davis and eight Nory and kirz and Lewis Hall and stuff who also aren't getting clean sheets but have a bit more going forward he's becoming a troll he is like I I look at him I mean I probably will have to play him this week because I don't really want to play Rogers and field but maybe I should because you know City at Brighton again I feel like they're going to concede Lewis probably isn't going to get an attack in return so what am I looking at a one or two point I might as well play Rogers and roll the dice maybe but I don't know I'll make up my mind later in the week maybe I'll read an article about Rogers and be convinced by that again but that's what it takes when it's so close you just it is I guess in a way you can when you're in my position well go against the EO and go well if if the player with lower ownership go with that person but I guess out of Lewis and Rogers there's not much in it is there so the one cave I would say on the strategy of of going with what players are saying about themselves is don't forget Nicholas bner who was the most arrogant you know if you went by purely by that he'd be your captain every week because of how well he spoke about himself but the thing is seeno had a sausage dog as well and he was really nice in the video and it's stupid isn't it because you start thinking what a nice guy and he's got he's got a dog like mine and yeah and then 10 minutes later the pep stuff comes out and then lo and behold I'm going now I'm going to start some menu and of course that must have fed into it it's so weird I don't know but it is it is you've got to be careful what you expose yourself to when you're looking at your fbl lineup because if you're on Twitter too much or you read too much or you watch a video or something obviously the biases come through don't they and you know you got to be aware of that and it could often go completely wrong the antithesis of Harland for you who you uh don't feel don't speak so highly of yeah I should have just stuck with my guns not gone on Twitter and made up my own mind but the fomo was made worse by all the ferar about the hat tricks and everything you you read about when I didn't have Harland there was all this talk of him getting what 40 goals this year suddenly that's all evaporated no one's got him anymore I'm looking at everyone's team everyone him and everyone's talking about Chris Wood like all the pundits and everything Chris Wood's getting all the attention about like oh isn't it marvelous how the oldfashioned number nine and suddenly the talk of Harland has completely I'm keeping the fave yeah Wai in the good let look at this um shows your am and he had Sal oh God my I just realized look at my formatting on that disgraceful the OCD is kicking in I've jsky salers aligned to the right as is mine and your Holland I'm should have corrected that never mind ignore that past can't see it um lots of Salah captains which surprises me I didn't realize that most of that way and obviously three hars yeah and and I because obviously it was Harland who make W guess for most of these teams when I checked through teams as I do when deadline passes I look and see what other people have done a lot of people made the Harland out to sell a move which paid off in the short term um but um yeah it's a big it's a big commitment how how do you feel about that now because you're looking at this you're probably one of the few managers along with myself who probably still got him yeah I mean I thought about it I thought about doing um Harland out for sou Harland I think it was Harland and as well as the salanki to himz move it was going to be Harland and uh because I've got dibling to Salah and himz I think it was I was determined to get himz kind of one way or the other and glad I didn't but I think it I would have I would have about broken even on it because although Salah would have come in and got the the goals I would have benched Rogers who scored so and then obviously with the hit I don't think there was a huge amount in in kind of in not doing it um I thought about doing it this week again not for himz this time but for for kuna um but as a spoiler I'm I'm not doing that so I'm going to be going another another week without Salah um in my team but yeah I I I kind of I expected it to be more split I expected there to be more I know obviously this isn't just all the people that have sold Sal I'm sure there's people here who have got Salah and Harland as well but when I was doing my my check of you know all the managers around us did you do that as well believe oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah I couldn't I couldn't quite believe how many how many people had sold him do do you have an order who do you have an order of whose teams you look at first oh yeah yeah of course because you do judge like I don't think it's a good thing I don't think it's very healthy but you do judge yourself by what other people have done how they're doing I know I'm I'm pretty sure people like Ben krin and general don't do this at all because they're stronger mentally and think that that probably affects them and it and they're probably right they're definitely right but I always do that when deadline passes I look at what you've done what Andy's done what late RIS has done what slippers has done yeah you know what I mean Raptor I look at his team there's probably about a dozen managers I look at and you like compare your players to their who go oh he's got him but I've got him and then he's got him and I've got him that can a little bit a little bit I'm more interested in what transfers they've made um because I don't watch the deadline streams so um it's it's I don't know what is done and things like that so I always like to have a look um but yeah it's I don't know how healthy that is to compare yourself confirmation bias of B the kid yeah I think I think a lot of it is if if if people are making similar moves to you it it feels quite good it was interesting though because because I looked at all the Sellar outs and all the Harland outs are in and the sell's in and I still just feel that there's not enough in it between seller and harand for me to to to really think that he's 100% the way to go I know s's been like unreal and unbelievable but I still find it crazy the the the points harland's got over the last two weeks you know and all we can do is forward tell me about it and I I don't know I look I look at I look at Brighton I look at Spurs and I look at Salah with um Villa and uh and Southampton and I think I don't know I don't know who's going to win out in that you know a people will say it's obviously going to be Salah but I I don't think it's that it's that clear cut to me I wouldn't I wouldn't be at allall surprised if if har came back race against follow no question there's not a massive gap between them but there is a gap in the money that's fact right so it's like what can you do with that that difference in funds I think also what is facted is City aren't in a as good a place as Liverpool so that's fact as well right so that's I think you know on a Level Playing Field Salo and Harland is not a lot in it and arguably harand sealing is higher I think it is but at the moment poor in this groove of winning matches and salah's just doing what he always does like CU i' I've had periods where I haven't owned him and you watch him you think when he's not playing well I'm going to get away with this and then he goes and gets a penalty or goes and gets a couple of assists at the end or gets a late goal and you think he's come out with a nine 10 point return out of what was a poor performance um and harland's capable of doing that as well but normally with Harland it's like it's kind of signposted he doesn't normally sneak of a turn it's like within the first 20 minutes and you're like oh God this is going to go really bad yeah exactly where Salah could just turn it like that that's the difference and um I guess that's the player he is it's true I mean it feels to me though that once Holland's gone I feel like that's him gone I don't really see how you can we've all used the wild cards or most of have used the wild cards so if you're selling him for Salah and okay there's midfields with Salah sacker and Palmer which look like unbelievable and I'm seeing some amazing teams out there without Harland but what do what are you going to do if you want Harlem back and I guess the answer to that is nothing right because you're not going to move you're not if if you're if you're taking the Harlem money and you're putting it around your team and you're putting into those three Assets in Midfield I don't see how there's ever going to be a point in which you say okay I don't want Salah anymore I don't want Palmer anymore I'm going to move back to Harland so you're you're done with him right that's that's how I see it until the wild card I agree yeah I don't think you're getting him back with three transfers no no because you have to spread the funds the only point in getting hland out of your team is to spread the funds and hope that that makes the difference and in a world in a landscape where we have got Palmer saaka son Salah and as we said last week a cast of forwards who are doing their job and getting maximum bonus from one goal spreading the funds should compensate should I would say but it's the recency bias again isn't it of we've just come off harland's most miserable run in his Premier League career for City one goal in in five he's I don't think he's done that before if the under if the underlyings were like the same as they had been against Newcastle and wolves I'd be in a very different place and again maybe this is where stats we we focus too much on on stats so maybe he just isn't a really poor era of confidence and he's not going to score but he's getting he's getting so many chances still um I'm H I'm happy I'm happy to keep him and and see him battle out against the the seller the seller owners but obviously they're both both great picks those of good comments coming in um that isn't one of them L because he's agreeing with you thanks um I I love this later on though uh this is uh this is from uh flimy Joy Bassel Bank Great Name this is like go back to the Scout cast he's put a rough with the smoth in look rough B in Salah but after too much drinking I forgot to confirm my squad so he sat my oh my God no sat on the bench oh the move for fimy was Rogers started in place that is a smoth same points same point yeah exactly it is did yeah did he Captain well he probably Captain somebody else but yeah some lovely stuff coming in and um yeah SWAT saying don't forget to like a lot of people agreeing with you I mean triggers in the chat saying he thinks it's S easy to buy harand back I mean it is it's two transfers I think it's a mental thing though is it it's that yeah it's that mental block in terms of you've done the effort to get Harland out you've spread the funds and then to almost go back to him feels like you're turning a sea tanker isn't it it's like I I don't I don't agree I I don't think back because I think if you if the easiest way to buying back would be to sell Salah and I don't see when you're going to sell Salah even if he blanked in the next three games which he won't but even if he did it still be like it's still seller you know playing for for Liverpool he'd have to go completely off the rails in the next five or six so to get harand you have to sell one of sacka or Palmer you're not going to sell one of sakur or Palmer with the Run they've got cuz the fixures are unbelievable you're not going to sell Palmer before you know like home game against wolves or you know whoever they're playing are you look sacker before West Ham it's this is the going to happen I mean we're going back to the ticker and the two teams top now this is the blackbox ratings by the way not the default ratings on Scout Scouts ratings are great but I like to tweak it a bit make Forest a bit more difficult you know let's face it that is a harder game than Scout right they're not bright red they're a bit bit less blue um but Chelsea and Arsenal are top of the ticket over the next 12 you know Chelsea got AR they got each other this week but after that they both got a fantastic run of fixtures and City AR far down the ticker but it's the next three for City plus if you look at this run for City we've said it before Brighton away Spurs Liverpool Forest Palace United Villa out of that run of eight fixtures seven fixtures right the only game that I would say is straightforward unless I don't think United will be now because Amarin the new manager first derby it's got to be more difficult for City you'd think the only fixure there I would say that City will win maybe easily is Palace away but cellers parks's a difficult place to go and by the time by the time they get there in game week 15 glasa might have sorted them out and made them hard to beat at home so I look at that and just I don't think there's an easy game there Forest at home would be in a couple of Seasons go but I don't think it will be for I look at I watched City last night against sportting I thought if we played for city tomorrow I re and Forest have a good chance because we we are incredibly hard to break down and Incredibly good on the Counterattack and I watched City and thought they haven't got many ideas at the moment they needed de Bry are on the pitch because they just quite predictable they are predict and and they're light in Midfield like the team you you can play it you can play out against them pretty easily and cut through the defense that's like kovic in that holding role um just just doesn't really work for me and and Lewis or Walker at right back I mean they're all good players obviously they're all good players and they're all capable of a bit of Magic on the but I would think looking at this Brighton are going to fancy it Spurs are going to fancy it Liverpool are definitely going to fancy it and unless de Bru is fully fit and harland's firing again I think Forest will go to the EAD with the best chance of getting something they've had since they've come up no question no question at all so I don't think an easy game there for them yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm giving Haren the next two Brighton and Spurs I I I think I probably will sell him ahead of Liverpool away because I could move him down to Salah who's who's he's got the home game um or over to sacka who's got West Ham which I like AR Arsenal hav't exactly been great I mean Arsenal last night were were pretty dire I mean they had a lot of the ball but again it was predictable there a lot of crosses to a center forward who doesn't exist yeah yeah J jezus came on and really couldn't generate much from that sacka was double teamed all the time and was frustrated and couldn't really Martin n is not offering enough down that side and obviously OD guard's not there odard cominging back we'll talk about it late is huge absolutely huge and so you know we've got odard and de coming back into these two teams it could make the world a difference let's look at some data though let's start because we're probably going to run on to three hours otherwise but good chat good chat so far lovely comments as well coming in so it's good um defense for the season a few things I want to mention here and it's not Forest um Villa I mean what did you make of the 4-1 at Spurs when defensive dat they're four feir 0.99 XG conceded non penalty per 90 and they were second I think on this table going into the Spurs game obviously they've slipped down now it's crazy isn't it I don't know what's going on with Villa they they seem both frustrating as a defensive unit even though the data is good and a little bit Limited in attack I mean I look at Watkins and he's only had more than two shots in one game all season wow that's a hell of a stat that is yeah I had a look in most games he's getting one or two shots but he's only had three in one fixture so far and he needs the Watkins of old needs volume like he's a better player now and he's better at taking his chances but my preconception of Watkins before last season was where he's going to need five or six chances to score I don't know if he's a striker who with if he only had two shots in the game could get the numbers he got last season what do you think about that yeah I mean when I watch Villa I think when they're on song and it's and it's clicking between you know biley Rogers Duran Watkins obviously they've got like Ramsey coming on T they've got players who when they link up and play really well it looks really vibrant and it's really attacking football and really quick like transitions across the pitch looks really good but there's been quite there been a couple of games now where you watch them and it just looks a bit laborious it looks a bit slow and that was happening against Spurs and then when when Villa scored from the set piece I kind of thought well that's that's it now like this is happened to Spurs so many times they' been in complete control conceded the goal and now they're going to kind of fall apart and they didn't they just they just carried on doing what they were doing before and once they got one it was just a matter of time before Villa kind of crumbled because they weren't offering no anything when wers went off they were like just limp I don't know what he's so key he's so key to them Morgan Rogers it's unbelievable um didn't didn't see that I thought he'd be a good pick for us at 5 million but I didn't think he'd be like the the Talis almost the Talisman of the team after 10 weeks don't know what's missing I don't know what it I mean maybe it's you know obviously Lewis has left and he was a big figure last season um anal has come in and he's perhaps not as mobile he's not as Dynamic with the ball and they've missed Lewis's set pieces because that was a big factor he was he was a master of those wasn't he mcin seems less of influence biley definitely is the fullbacks definitely are as well Rogers and Watkins have looked okay but they've kind of looked like their partnership is absolutely key if that's not on song yeah they're really struggling it's it's weird there's a lot of teams in that kind of bracket I would say is is when when they sold dougas Louise I thought this might be the kind of problem they'd have because he was that kind of yeah eight role who who box the Box just linked everything so well they signed Anana and I thought okay Ana's more defensive at least he has been a Everton and then when he signed he started getting them the goals in the first couple of weeks I was kind of thinking oh they want something here they they've literally made a like for like placement with a player that I I didn't expect but I do wonder if now they just they just seem to be missing that energy like in the Midfield between between the defense and the attack which which Louise gave him so well and that ability with him to pass the ball you know he his passing was was Unreal last season he could pick a ball out from you know from right across the haven't really got anyone that's looking up and and trying to put a ball over the top so much like Watkins isn't getting as many I I thought Villa against Spurs Watkins would be thr on goal like over and over and over again without there yeah yeah but it just didn't seem to to happen and Spurs played well I thought drasin played played really well in that game but I didn't feel like they tested them that often by trying to put those balls over the top and trying to get Watkins involved and I was surprised at that CU I thought that was probably their best their best weapon Matt saying it's all about fixtures yeah it is but let's have a look at their fixtures if you look at the short term they're they're pretty bad um you know Liverpool away Palace at home Chelsea away I mean it's all about the home games Palace brenford sampton you'd think that they would I'm certainly brenford and sampton and you're GNA you're going to hold Rogers probably for those two but the away games are tough for them so it's kind of they're one of those teams that have got fixtures that are on off on off on off there's no sustained spell other than those two Bren that brenford santon over a longer period yeah they're right down there like over the 12 they're third from bottom so it I also think as well Lo losing to club bruge was I mean that Tyro Mings picking the ball up and giving a penalty that that's a bad result for them because they were flying through that and coasting and now that Palace game looks good the one sandwiched in between Chelsea and um Liverpool but then they've got Juventus after that Palace game so you've got to think you know Watkins isn't going to see 90 minutes in in that game they might even take Rogers off early in that they play brenford and Southampton back to back but after Southampton which is arguably the best game you can have this season they then go away to Red Bull leig and Juventus will be an interesting game because if they lose that game to Juventus and then they've got to go away to Red Bull Li there's suddenly going to be a lot of pressure on them to get a result in that match so again um we talked about Jackson before and how he's starting every game and you know Watkins and the Duran threat but there could be more rotation coming I think particularly over over this period because of though the the import if they'd beaten Club brouge I think that it might have eased it a little bit but losing one nil was wasn't really a game I don't think they could afford to to lose it's 8 nil Chelsea at the moment 8 n oh my God first team out I know the other thing I want to say about Villa is Jan right and when Rogers went off it was interesting I mean never talk of an injury but he didn't want to go off and Emory said interestingly yeah I don't think the injury is too bad because he didn't want to come off but I wanted to get I wanted to get two forwards on I've got thoughts on on on it does make me wonder that because Jan is there and he's like on a leash and he's proving himself and he wants to get starts as soon as there's an opportunity to get him on the pitch Emory's is like yeah I'll take that because in the back of his mind he's thinking if as soon as there's a window where I should consider putting Jan on I'm going to take it so as soon as Roger's got a knock but he's off get Emory get Jan on and it'll be the same for Watkins as well like so that is a thing when you're take when if you're owning Watkins and Rogers if they get with 20 minutes to go there is no question they're coming off because he he's looking for a chance to get Duran in on the pitch to keep him appeased now maybe that's speculative but that's how it seemed to me in that game because I don't think I think Rogers could have stayed on and they might have done better my my thoughts on on on Morgan roggers in that game and I'm a big Morgan Rogers fan don't get me wrong because I takes of a pinch of salt but don't complain about getting subbed off if you're going to spend 5 minutes rolling around on the floor okay crying in pain and then your manager Subs you off and you go what are you doing I'm fine don't roll around then just get up get on with it if you're fine get up you think he'd know you think you think Watkins and Rogers go on thinking Duran's gonna come on with 15 20 minutes to go so let me let me make sure I don't give em a chance I've never I've never I've never seen like it cuz like so when son got subbed he was he looked good he was running around and he was like what are you doing R just got subbed and did the same reaction you've been rolling on the floor for 5 minutes man um let's move on um City uh slipped down here but you know chances per 97.6 which is extraordinary clean sheet slow as we said you know we talked about Lewis andard already um United the big chances is the highest though so when they are getting a chance it's 2.3 big chances conceded per 90 Palace have got three I mean they're City are certainly the biggest in the top 10 aren't they other than Bournemouth so yeah they are conceding uh The Wider big open chances yes um and Arsenal have slipped down and suddenly Liverpool and Forest are the two best defenses .81 0.89 um don't laugh um United what you make United because obviously with um the new manager Amarin coming in the talk is all about Bruno and we'll talk about Bruno in a bit any anything making you think maybe we should reconsider the defense cuz it's it's 14th here so this would cons this would say no but but they've had the most clean sheets have they this season uh they've done second most one at one point they they'd had the most I don't that's that's continued but I think I think it might beings must must BEP four four clean sheets yeah Liverpool got five Liverpool got six I believe yeah for they were at one point they the most but now now it's um now now it's okay now they're third but still it's it's not bad I mean I am getting swept up in the amarim hype you are already are you I am yeah I can't help it I mean you watch that performance that they put in against City and you see the way he's got them playing and um if you watch Monday Night Football as well you saw some of the stats that he's bought into to sporting um this is the bias I was talking about with some if you watch too much of this you get you're going to end up buying gar oh you really got it oh yeah too late that was before as well you're so vulnerable yeah I know um but like you know top for Progressive carries top for BL shots top for XG top for goals all the things and okay it's what what Cara described actually as a a league um enough just a bit but and and you know Manchester United aren't aren't one of the top teams in in the league so it's going to be a a difference um obviously but yeah I think it is exciting I think um I've been watching a lot of like tactics videos about him we're going to do a bit on am him in in a bit uh but it's it's going to be really to see whether he comes in and tries to stamp the you know the three the back formation the wing backs the kind of three rotating sing side forwards uh all play or whether he he kind of keeps going with with what rud's rud then T been doing so yeah I don't I I think you if you're going to if you're going to buy into it you have to buy into it now because of the next three pictures it's got to be the attack lad rather than the defense I would have thought we'll look at we'll look at it in a bit it's interesting because you said about when you watch tactics thing I think it does affect you before the season started I did a lot of work on Moresco and slot and I looked into slots tactics if you remember I showed formations on here didn't I and I thought out of that I thought this is could have influenced me and it did cuz what I did well there was two things I could have done I could have gone Diaz cuz I was convinced that one of the Wingers was going to be more inverted than the other and I thought it would be Diaz with Salah staying wide and that is what we've seen so I could have gone Diaz that would have worked out well I didn't go DF did I I went bloody quono instead you got it right for 45 minutes I got it right for 4 cuz I went oh I'll go qu cuz he's going to play and he's a four million Defender and uh he's definitely going to prefer the ball playing Defender cuz that's how slot likes to play yeah so rather than take the the Diaz lesson which would have been marvelous cuz he got like five goals in the first three or four game weeks I went for bloody quono which last his 45 minutes I'm so gutted I know yeah you it does affect you doesn't it when you've when you think you're on to Summit I go oh I'm gonna go for that so you got to be careful gotta be careful but yeah I mean you were you were right to go for it you just went for the wrong one of the of the of the two options I mean you call Liverpool being a you know a good team but a more kind of functional team a less chaotic Al then again I mean coming from klopp it was always going to be a slightly less less chaotic team but yeah I don't think I can claim that saying Liverpool a good team is that much of a grand move I I yeah but I I I think I was expecting more of a more of a drop off from them than we've seen I thought it was a big job to replace such a legend in club and I thought there might be a bit of adjustment period or a bit of time to to take but they've been absolutely yeah unreal outstanding top of the defense uh not top of attack uh because Spurs at top of the attack and I don't think that that is surprising given what we saw against Villa and it is the basis on which I I've gone fre Spurs hoping that that would get returns I guess it's surprised that he Chelsea up there but then you know they banged in eight tonight and I guess that explains why Palmer from game rout 12 is is such a priority what is surprising is Arsenal I think you know they're not the best defense now that's been carrying them they're like four in the defensive data based on XG on penalty conceded they're down in six here 1.58 behind United Liverpool Chelsea City and Spurs but OD guard's back and and that that that could unlock them right I I hope that does I hope the handbreak comes off a bit and hav Herz and sacka become you know I'm not scared of havs and sacka at the moment for me though that's that the difference is odard I just I just think there there completely different team to judge when they've got him in the side and when they haven't cuz when you look at the front three when you look at the Midfield three of what Marino um rice and well part has been playing at right back for a bit hasn't he he played Midfield last night it's been hav havit have been dropping in isn't he to the eight and and and I mean it's just there's just no there's no creativity there is there there's nothing there's no one that can unlock defenses in that Midfield three they and Martinelli don't bring enough to the party do they yeah they and they've both been poor they've both been poor this season they they were last I mean jayus um if I was if I was playing against Arsenal and I saw Martinelli trossard and Gabriel jayus in the side I wouldn't be filled with fear like they're good they're good players but they're not League winning they're Squad players in in my opinion um and then you look at that Midfield fre and you think well who in that Midfield I mean rice is going to run around and and do a great job and obviously he's got a lot of talent don't get me wrong 80 million pound player he runs around a bit but he's not who's who's going to be the person to play that killer ball through you know and if they do play the killer ball through who who's who's getting on the end of it I don't they ring they're relying so much on sacka and and you can he's not easy to shut down let's face it he's getting harder by the season to shut down but you can I mean they did a good job on him last night and it showed how you could restrict them when you do do that and they they're desperate to get odard back there's no question and I think I would then expect them to climb this table and and we've said if you look at the long ticker they're right up there for the fixtures and from game 12 onwards or maybe 13 West Ham away that's where you got to get on them I think again there's a brilliant comment in the chat if you could if you could flag out from no weak foot uh just saying they need Smith row that you know what that is that is exactly who they need well he would have played wouldn't he he would have played I think he would have played I think I think he'd be starting I think he'd be starting the matches that odard was out if they had him in because they haven't got another player that can drive with the ball like he does and and and play a ball through to to some of these forwards and Wingers I think they're really it doesn't surprise me at all to see Arsenal sick on this list because I just I think they're quite I think they're quite ordinary at the moment yeah but we expect them to pick up and we expect them to climb his table again and and threaten United attack is up there we talked about the defense does the presence of them fing this table 1.60 before Amarin gets there does that make you even more tempted to go all in well the issue the issue the issue isn't so much the the stat this year is the lack of goal I think they're 18th for goals lack of goals this season or or something like that and again you look at the team and think where the goals going to come from because holand isn't I don't think Holland's a 20 25 goal a season Striker um rashford hasn't been on it for ages garnacho is really wasteful You could argue Amad deserves to to start but he's I think he's got a couple tonight but I'd be probably more surprised than not if he if he started the weekend um so so where the goals coming from are the goals going to come from Fernandez is he going to L step up well he hasn't scored more than 10 goals in his last three years is he maybe I'm completely wrong with that but definitely you know I'd be surprised if he's I can tell getting more than that you go go there you go you go that that's go bang on bang on 10 goals in bang on 10 goals that's his Premier League career um so obviously his best season 32 returns 2021 when when we were talking about him being the new king of fbl even over Salo at that point God it's not great is it and it's been it's been deed since um 19 goal returns last season though 34% of the uh goal involvement he's on 33% goal involvement this season because United have been so poor at scoring goals he's only had three returns but that three returns is enough to get him a third of the oh my God yeah it just shows you doesn't it how they've struggled because they've only scored they've only scored nine goals and which I think it's Southampton has scored fewer so Amarin has got a bit of a BL canvas but he's got a lot to do isn't he and and Bruno's got to be the player that I mean let's have a look at let's have a look at United's cast here zi we can we can count out on the grounds that he's put on some Timber apparently but you know ACC report apparently yeah he's he's a stone heavier than he should be according to V tenar when he left your man gun atos up there in terms of points per XG I non penalty per .52 just ahead of Bruno and gacher is the more palatable if you're going to go anywhere because it's 63 compared to 82 for me though it's about losing a Midfield slot to United player I'm not sure I'm ready for that I'm okay I'm okay with v next three this is the thing because there is no better fixtures than than Lester rip switch and Everton if you were to pick three fixtures yeah it would be those two maybe West Ham would would be one of them but definitely or obviously South Hampton if if you had all three PR teams in a row but you know in terms of in terms of a three I think that's that's excellent um the question is I mean if amam comes in doesn't matter what tactics he brings in doesn't matter what formation he changes what players he brings Off the Bench or whatever there isn't players in the team who can score goals yeah he's got to change that mentality and he's got to get them scoring and I look at that cast that you've got on there and who's going to fly in that who is who is going to be the one that steps up and starts banging in the goals there's a lot on Bruno Bruno Bruno's got to get 10 goals again I mean if you go back at these numbers he got 10 10 goals last season 10 in 2122 he's got to hit double figures again yeah hasn't he because I don't I think you're absolutely right you look at this and think I'm not sure gacho can holand might be able to if he trans to me H's the one though holand is the one that needs to step up because he's the only nine in that team xery xery isn't isn't good enough this season I don't think he's going to need time he's more of a link player isn't he he's not he's not an out out his reputation isn't that of a goal scorer necessarily they can't s rashford up front because that doesn't work they tried that they tried that every year and it it doesn't work so do try it every year it's only Highlands there that can do it so he needs to start scoring more regularly has to yeah I me I mean he's got it in him but I just think he's still one maybe even two seasons away from his Peak um well he is need to St need to stay fit need to have a prolong period without in injury but I think it's you you're right I think it's it's not just tactics and formation it's mentality if you look at we look at this amarin's going to turn up and we think he's going to favor a 3421 and these both these images are both courtesy of Sky's recent article by the way which you know I've in danger of being biased by reading that but I'm not I'm not going to go all in on United as might be open to persuasion but I don't know how quickly he's going to move to this whether he'll land and go right three at the back Wing backs will he will he do that do you think or will it take time cuz I I was looking at like predicted lineups for for manest United if they if they switch this formation and actually they they have three good center backs for this formation in yoro Martinez and delit well yoro isn't fit and he's 18 years old so yeah I don't see how he can play delict and Maguire in in a back three I mean the teams are going to eat that up for breakfast AR that's Martinez carrying a lot then in that so I I I don't think he can go to a back three if if if it's until Yo's Yo's back um they've got Ma do for the wing back slots and sure if he's if he's ever fit they could also play gono at at left wing back I was going to ask yeah whether you think he's going to end up at Wing back yeah he could do is interesting because he he tends to be the right wing back that's the more attacking um one and that's that's what the graphic that's what the graphic shows here sporting average positions under ammer in it's it's right hand side that's where is the more attacking side so that's Dow that's got to be that's got to be Dow I would have thought mazra is a good player but if you're and it could be Fernandez yeah if you're going to bring in the most attacking for Wing back is it's going to be Dow on that side um I don't know if gacho is is totally suited for a left wing back role is I mean unless you're literally just telling him to stay past the halfway line I mean his work rate isn't no isn't the best is it well I mean if he's going to end up there teams are going to Target that aren't they teams I would yeah I would no question oh my camera's gone off um no question at all that they would Target that um but um yeah I I I mean it's it's the right side Midfield behind the forward which will be holand which is interested um that's where we think Bruno is going to play right it has to be it has to it has to be Bruno because the the two Center mids have got to do so much running and you've got to think that's going to be mayo and agat right because that that is that's what they do that's like the roll in in the so they actually seem perfect for this system in in the Midfield um and Bruno seems perfect in one of those inside forward spots I think when when United have got like a fully fit team I think it kind of works because you've got Martinez deck and um and yoro you've got Shaw on the left you've got dallow on the right ugat and um I mean casir is just just out isn't he um ugat and uh and Mayu and then you've got Fernandez rashford and and hland that works but if you take a couple of those players out through injury or or whatever suddenly I don't think the system they haven't got the squad to I don't know to keep to keep the kind of momentum or to make changes I don't I just don't really see how he how he brings this in straight away and implements it he needs players basically I think he needs time and I don't think he goes to this straight away you have no sound Mark what have you done I was so well sorry I was interrupting you anyway I muted to get my camera back on um he needs a transfer window doesn't he yeah he does I think so yeah I I think that he's one or two key players from this formation I don't I don't think he's got enough Deb foot win back to play this week in week out he hasn't got that Center back like you say that's fit and I I don't know if rashford and Bruno are going to play behind the striker in those rols I mean Bruno definitely can rashford it could it could be Amad like a few like a few people are saying but that's a big step up yeah it just feels like to wear pegs to me it does a little bit a little bit Yeah considering the pressure he'll be under to get results I think he'll rethink it and stay with the four at the back initially and then do what he see what he can do in January basic that's way he'll go yeah all right let's look at the regular stats of players not too much to talk about as always other than the fact that you take Allison out the equation because he's injured on his way back SS is the best keeper now in terms of points per 90 4.8 which is crazy um you ruined him for everyone I Blame You entirely I not good enough just didn't see it at all but he's been outstanding four clean sheets but obviously been bring in some saves and bonus as well um wanted to talk about um Onana here cuz you know he done well with the four clean sheets of mention and that could be if you really want to go united I'm sure United fans are itching to get more players in and Nana could be a logical step because he he has done well even under tag so you'd think there could be an improvement under Amarin as well um fleen we've already talked about so there's there's not too much movement here other than I think that yeah reyya will come again I think with the fixtures we've seen um given where Arsenal are on the ticker and from game 13 onwards I don't think Forest at home is an easy game but I don't it could be a clean sheet I don't know about you but I do expect to want to move back to two Arsenal Defenders um from about you know from 12 13 ORS are you thinking I've got them I've got two I've still got Ry I've got I've got Gabrielle it's been a rough ride up until now but I look at that run you know Forest West Ham Manchester United Fulham Everton Palace ipswitch brenford you know 12 right till 19 that's what eight games it's easy to say isn't it I mean you'd expect three or four clean sheets yeah minimum from from those um if I was picking a goalkeeper from gameweek 12 it would be ryer yeah so I'm happy to I'm happy to have him yeah I I think that when I move Harland out some of the money that is cleared will be to try and move back to two two Arsenal Defenders you won't keep I I find it I mean he's done all right for me he's got a couple of Falls so he's got he's had a couple to be fair he has he has but I I don't want to take him Beyond I mean like this is with good fixtures as well I mean it was interesting though to watch brenford atam and they said that they spoke to Frank before the game and they said would you take a one- nil or 43 what you prefer he goes always a 4-3 and then his team put on the most flaccid performance I've seen for some time right well it was it was ridiculous wasn't it it was like oh we're we're won that up that's just it basically Cooper it was I couldn't believe I couldn't believe I was watching yeah of of all the teams of all the managers to put in performance like that I could not believe it was it was brenford it was ridiculous it was like 45 shots or something was it to like four it it was it I mean Ando was just nothing he was more fullback than a Winger wasn't he I mean he played down the middle yeah come I mean it was strange so I do wonder whether Frank is suddenly going you know what I'm tired of the four threes and let's go but because they were once a side that were built on a bit of discipline at the back set pieces when they first came up that's how they build that that's that's what you do when you get promoted it's what Forest did you you you have to grind out results they became a bit more of a flare team who scored goals this season and played a different style of football which just left them open I do wonder if he's like time to move the dial back but he doesn't want to admit that be interesting but yeah there's no doubt find the middle ground yeah you don't you don't need to be up there or you know bloody on the bottom find find a nice Middle Ground you got to attack Fulham a little bit I don't agree with sexy B saying is rough two world is an injury time I don't think it was rough at all I think it was completely deserved completely deserved that F and won that game I mean they didn't I mean brenford here 15th for the defensive weight data 1.71 they did have a a tough start but they've had good fixtures recently um remind me what their fixtures are like short long term they're pretty bad now so they've got these three ever leer then it falls off a cliff right there's no way I'm taking fle into that one I mean it will be saves Gore but Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest Brighton ARs they're not they're not getting anything from them's getting a 50 pointer in one of those games a one nil a one nil against Chelsea away where where's the clean sheet coming there Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest yeah but he'll do it to SP because that's what that's what these players love to do they love to spite us I mean I I'm even looking in buo and thinking I don't know if I want him over that run no I'll be selling he's he's too highly owned I think to to keep um and you know that's that's that's pure black box that is too highly owned to keep too highly owned to he's boring isn't he everyone's got him you don't even get you don't even celebrate his his points when they when they come in um I mean Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest Brighton Arsenal nah we can do better in Midfield I think over that certainly be sing the analytics crew will be shouting skill issue at you now I saying that and me for saying it as well but you know he's on pens 90 minute man ever present perfect algorithms absolutely love him regardless of fixtures but yeah I think you're right I think that if you're trying to push up trying to push towards you know 100K which is what we've got to be aiming for you perhaps have to roll the dice against inmo for that run because it's dismal there's no question um y I guess I guess I guess I guess the question is where' you go but we can cross that bridge when we get to Midfield in a minute um I don't really want to talk too much about tread because we did that last week but Simas he is he is now the starter and he's third in this table 0.26 which there's a whole gaggle of Defenders around that 0.2 bracket Trent out on top 0.36 so above them but only just it's not a huge margin and with the it test as we've seen simic talk to me about him 4 six taking set pieces has that more quality than Robertson I would say in terms of delivery and actually in terms of xgi outperformed Trent in that game last weekend I think he came out 0.56 and Trent if I remember the walkout video was about 0.15 or something dismal like that so simcast definitely can offer us something how close now are you is it week by week we're getting closer to letting Trent go how close are you I mean Sim is is on my wall there on side after the after the bench boost uh last year so obviously a big fan I don't necessarily think he's a step up from from Robertson I think he is this season because Robertson has has obviously you know declined in in a lot of areas because he's getting on a bit and fair enough but you know I don't feel like Sim is like a new signing who's a great left back necessarily I think he's a squad player who has kind of been thrust into the role because Robertson has has you know gone down I wonder if they're going to move in January for a new left back and Manchester United are going to be moving for a new left back as well it's a very popular I mean England don't even have a left back so it's it's a it's a highly sought after position with not too many options available so yeah be see what they what they do Trent yeah I mean like you said I think we need to talk about Trent a little bit because again I don't think the Run of fixtures Liverpool have got lends themselves so well to clean sheets coming forward I think after that Southampton game uh it's what Everton it's Newcastle it's man city as well and it's going to be hard for him to justify 7 million unless he's getting more regular returns um attacking wise because there's so many Defenders who are getting good attacking returns would I move Trent to Simas not a chance you would not a chance you're just you're just I would go anywhere near Simas I I just don't think Robertson comes in every now and then and plays Gomez can play on the left as well can't he he could come in for a game I don't think Simas is is like too far ahead of either of them so avoid for me okay and and you I'm look at Liverpool's fixtures they're not great I don't believe they're okay I mean they've got that City Newcastle 134 which is tough way I'm looking at this thinking where's the clean sheets coming from here Villa I I I actually think they can keep a clean sheet against Villa they certainly can against sampton but after that I think the next three or four very tough because they've got City Newcastle Everton and Spurs I mean I guess they can go a good as some part plenty teams can but it's a bit different when it's a spicy Derby isn't it even calv Louis might score in that one but yeah I I think yeah I think I mean there's clean sheets there for sure but um in a world where those fixtures are tougher the problem with Trent is I just I want it to happen I want that game to happen where he just gets those couple of attacking returns and everyone goes ah yeah I do need him I do need him after all yeah well hopefully it's going to be one of the next two because it's filler and Southampton yeah and then it's the the the poor run I mean if we're selling Harland and we're selling Trent where the hell's all our money going yeah it's true kogo you think that um Min is going to come back in don't you you don't think that role on the right side in front of elman's going to be his you think he what moves back to left back at that point then do you I'm very surprised he's been he started so many on on the wing because obviously gruda is there as well who's very highly rated HZ said he was really excited to work with him but clearly hasn't uh hasn't done that I wonder if if maybe R could move over to the right now we got Pedro coming back and O'Reilly's back in the squad too so and and M's back in training so I I can't see any World in which kyogo carries on on a right wing there there's too many options that can come in look out for o Al by the way he's he's absolute quality I saw you tweet today about well there's a number of players who can play the 10 it won't take long before O'Reilly gets the 10 and it's and it's his in my book I think he's well then the question where do pro then where does Pedro play yeah it's it's a problem because I I think O'Reilly is going to be a starter very very quickly because I I just think he's exactly what you need um for me he's so technically good he's a scorer of goals and a Creator I think we need a pascal gr we need a pascal in in that 10 he's not as consistent as gross so and he has been in a weaker league so let's see how he adjusts there's no question but he's got all the tools so I would have thought that he will end up being your 10 by the end of the season just how quickly he goes in I don't think he's going to be a fantasy asset not yet he could be next season though so C GL said no not much going there well whoa well well well I don't I don't I don't think he is a no I just think if you're expecting him to start on the wing again you're probably unlikely I I actually still think with Brighton's fixtures after C I was gonna say yeah yeah even are strong right yeah even if he plays at left back I think he's a good option I think he's really starting to adjust to the league now I think he's first choice I think he plays every game I think he's he's the best defender we've got and the best one of the best players in the squad now he was signed of a massive reputation and we're really starting to see that coming through I would expect some clean sheets over the Run of Southampton Fulham Leicester Palace West Ham so you go you go over you go cadog over dunk or Barco would you basically very good I still think Barco could come good at some point but sorry I'm joking yeah I'd go I'd go kogu dunk was dunk was interesting at the start of the season because we thought the set piece threat would would be there but hasn't really materialized I think kloo is is the one he he's a bit riskier than dunk but he offers a bit more yeah okay uh okay I put some Chelsea Defenders at the end of the table here none of them kind of featur in the top 30 well they don't it's not kind of they don't um but Chelsea's fixtures are very strong and we're all about Parmer from the attack as well we haven't really touched on Sanchez as an option any Chelsea Defenders tempted you at all I mean I think it's interesting Reese James coming back what' you make of that not not going in for Reese no yeah I mean he's not he doesn't look the same kind of player at the moment is he obviously he's trying to build build Fitness up but yeah he he looks like it might take him a little while to to get going um I mean Gusto is the one that's maybe yeah more impressive because he's inverting a bit a bit more and getting forward but I wonder if that's going to carry on maybe when James is back to his best he go moves back to right back they got I don't see I think it's going to be inversion on the other side it's it's just whether karella takes Gusto's minutes away that's the thing and he could because karella is more natural perhaps in that role I just don't really there's just not a lot to like is there about the defense they they con see goals they there's there's like rotation around those kind of more attacking spots you're not going to go for CWI or for far cuz there's much more attacking options um for for the same price um yeah hard aoid and the thing is as well like we said it didn't we earlier in the show it's like there were four fives like Davis like eight Nori who offer you a bit more in attack and Gusto and karella can't really even though they're inverted they can't really compete with that they need the clean sheets if if Chelsea suddenly turn into like a defensive Juggernaut then then maybe we can consider them but maybe I just I just can't see it fair enough uh Midfield then let's look at that uh the Bo's top which for ages has not been worth a mention but he's coming back and it was interesting to see him I I I don't can't work out what pep was doing last night that night wasn't last night night before wasn't it 4-1 down they go 3-1 down and N Gallagher expert Co comor that he is was calling out for uh he was he was doing cooms did you see that no Gallagher no he was doing no he was doing he was doing Co coms with Dan Fletcher and um I can't remember who was on with Fletch but it was it was no G gone I know so they had they had a shamelessly saying we're going to have a fan of one of the teams as a co- commentator I've never seen that um and he was saying promoting the tour and stuff he probably gave him a lot of money about I've never cuz he kept saying we he kept saying oh we're this and we're that oh great it's great isn't it when a when a co- commentator is so so unbiased um but no Gallagher was saying oh this game's crying out for Kevin he was that's the other thing he was doing he's calling players by their first name because yeah oh who does that yes as if no Gallagher gets to wander into the city dressing room when he likes to have drink well he probably does so fair enough but um yes I know what you're getting out there but he was he was basically saying um Brennan he was basically saying this game's crying out for Kevin at 3-1 down and he was right I was like well they need a bit of invention maybe Kevin can come on see I'm doing it now he can come on and turn it no he doesn't bring it him on then so we were like thinking well he can't be fit then can he he can't you know if he's not coming on now he's not going to come on he can't be fit he's on the bench to make up the numbers they go 4-1 down with five minutes of stoppage time to go and pep goes come on Kev on you come what's that about he's just come back from injury the game's gone there's five minutes left game gone you're right yeah why would you put de boy on I just I mean I know that I'm not pep none of us are Pep and I know he's a genius but even Luke I think would struggle to work out what pep was thinking there with the game finished and with five minutes to go that's when you go oh yeah I'll tell you what kev's been out for months but they stick him on see how he does in the last five minutes very strange decision but it was it was also strange that he was on the bench for Bournemouth and they were 2-1 down desperate for a goal and they don't bring him on in that game is like what's the point of him even being on the bench in that point of him being on the bench in either of those games you've got to think that it's it is a numbers thing rather than name three Keepers they're putting de bruyer on and then if they're really really desperate they bring him on and I get it but why bring him on when you're 4-1 down in a game that you know they're not knocked out as a result of losing that game so why why try and he's not going to turn it around is he in five minutes the the only thing I can think of is is is he's trying to give de bruyne like a psychological lift that he's been out for a while and now he's gets to come back and feel the grass under his feet and hear the crowd and all that that's but that is clutching that's all I've got imagine someone gone through him and he's out for the season just because of that five surely you I mean I don't know I mean who am I to question pep but I thought it was really odd well he done it before with de Bry didn't he de Bry was out for the whole preseason and then he chucked him into that first game was it last last year or maybe the year before and then he was out for like four months and then pep was like I probably shouldn't have played him in that game he wasn't really ready why'd you do it then anyway yeah what' you make of that impact on thoden I mean we expect it to help Harland because deyne is Elite when it comes to creating chances there's no there's no one in the league like him um that's why he's top of his table do you I mean I can't see foden operating out wide and Bernardo Silva starts so surely de Brer back means fod and becomes more of a question mark right yeah is a strange one because I can't see a world where foden gets a prolonged period of time out of the team because of do you not his quality well no because he's he's just he's just one player of the season and he in the games I've seen even the last few he's he's he's he's he's you know he's been very influential in the last couple of games I know they haven't won but he scored the goal against sporting he he had a good game I thought against Bournemouth created loads of opportunities in that created like what four big chances in the game against Southampton um as well the issue is like you say is is where' you playing because they they've got Savio on the right who I think is excellent um foden we know from last year worked best with Walker bobbing past him so he could kind of Tuck into the middle not really going to get that so much with with Lewis um so does he play in you know I guess it's him and de bruyne in Midfield but then they haven't got the where's Berard going then but the trouble is they haven't got the um they haven't got the cover cuz it's all right to do that when you've got Rod doing the work all the Dirty Work behind you they have to play gundan gundan and cover have to play don't they I I I don't think I don't think gan's been good at all since he's come back from from Barcelona so I think they've got a real I mean it's obvious to say they're missing rodri but when The Replacements aren't really stepping up it's a big problem and you're right I mean I I guess Bernardo would move over to the left but then they've got um Nunes there as well haven't they yeah I don't know I think it is a problem for foden um I've got I've got one more week with him I think he he against Brighton he's got a good record against against us as well um but then I think he is an issue but I don't really see how he can not play him but then I don't really see how he can play consistently I think de bruy just doesn't play every game I know I think I think if you're GNA Play De Brer it's going to be in Europe and it's going to be the tougher tougher teams it's going to be the games that you won't fow them in the easier fixures I think we're still going to get that but it's going to be interesting Mojo saying I don't he's trying to give him some minutes and a done game what's weird about that cuz it was a stoppage time it was literally the injury time he brought him on for 5 minutes isn't going to benefit ala did it with oard last night as well didn't he he gave him like two or but the game wasn't Out Of Reach yeah it was 4-1 so it's like with odard coming on you think well he might do something to get them a point still late though I don't know why you they were one goal behind so I could sign of see the logic of it like he might 10 minutes though yeah but I still thought it was I mean even though I agree the de one the de one the de bruyne one is is weird I think it it it will when de bruyer is playing I think it will have an impact on ph I think it probably means he goes out to the right still but we think he's less effective there with with without walk cup so yeah indeed uh Diaz and Salah Diaz with a hattrick um yeah yeah I said in my walkout video that it was only Salah really and then Diaz goes and get the hatrick to shut me up um yeah what you think it's going to happen this is this is it's going to be like this all season jot comes back scores a brace Diaz gets a goal gakpo suddenly is the the best it's I'm just not going near it you're I can't be I I can't be dealing with it I I do think though di Diaz should be playing through the middle over Darwin do you I like that that's that gakpo Diaz Salah is that is a potent front could that be a thing I think so cuz so I think Darwin's been all right but I still don't think he's got a long-term future so in a world where Diaz starts looking like he could play centrally well then that then I think that change I mean when J's back though you've still got that question mark around Diaz and J but if J's out for a while and Diaz is playing through the middle then but yeah 100% you said tonight you were in a sleeper call and you said that Dan fbl mate offered us Bowden for Diaz yeah he obviously feels Diaz end up being down the middle that isn't quite that isn't quite what happened I I tried to pressure him into selling phone for Diaz what are you doing without my permission we assistant manager you we co-managers what you yeah well I thought once it once we got the offer then we could talk about it it was you know I had to I had to give it the big the big talk at the time to try and get the off from the table you're just trying to get your own back for the fact that I turned down himz for intia I kept intia now he's injured and I missed out on all that did did you turn it down yeah turned it down oh I thought we missed it I was saying today I thought we miss turn it down also threw an insult Sal as way and think oh do you think we're stupid you might be able to catch us back from the pub I was I was always oh after that yeah yeah anyway oh that would have been a great move yeah thanks Eddie will come good don't worry a couple of years be fine um Palmer injury just a load of nonsense injury if if if he if he doesn't play I'll eat this hoodie there you go yeah I I I can't help but think that mesa's gone okay alessa's playing nonsense with sacka and all this stuff about you not not pitched in the training picks and obviously they play Arsenal next and Palmer is like Palmer's a player that would if Arsenal thought he wasn't playing it could completely change their tactics so you got to think the mesa's like well yeah there could be you know he has he's not trained today and all this he hasn't trained because he's not playing in Europe and we know that and he wasn't in any of the picks and all this stuff and it's I don't know maybe I'm wrong for me the Martinez challenge the contact was minimal it wasn't a regular challenge I know moresa said that and you're right but to me it didn't look like there was enough contact to make Palmer injured out for the weekend but we'll see I guess I think I I I actually think it was quite a quite a nasty knock and it is the kind of thing that I could see being a bit of an impact injury that keeps you out of training for a couple of days but there's absolutely no way there's enough in that to keep you out of Chelsea versus Arsenal with the way Chelsea are playing and at a time when arsenal were beatable at the moment this isn't the Arsenal of like the end of last season when they're winning every game Chelsea look at that game and think we can do them over it there there's just no way Palmer doesn't play that game he just 100 I'm like 99.9 reoccurring percent sure he starts he'll get patched up and play I don't think Chelsea do it but we'll see when we get to predictions what I think there but I think that um Palmer plays yeah for sure absolutely it's not muscular it's a knock that's that's the key thing and he and he's with the England squad as well and he would have they would have pulled him out of that I mean moresa could have used this as an opportunity to pull him out of the England squad and said oh he's got got a bit of a I re it's Palmer saying don't pull me out of it because I'm you know I've got to make a St for Tel I'm fine yeah yeah see I buy that um son will be a Target if Bren if Palmer is out I mean the natural thing would be for those without Spurs players going into the IT switch game if Palmer is known as out obviously you move Salah if you can if you haven't got him but I would have thought son would be the natural step down if before the break and then obviously you have to go back to Palmer after that if you add Palmer and he is rolled out would you hold him through the break for 12 given that obviously that's when we need him for that fixture run or would you move him out and spend two transfers what would you do yeah and the other question I did the Q&A with Sam for scout earlier and she's um she's on a w so the moment she's got Palmer and no son and I kind of said to her why don't you well and she agreed like wouldn't you go for like son you know move to Palmer afterwards because she haven't got she hasn't got value tied up in him either she's buying Palmer for the first time on the wild card um obviously you're booking in a transfer and everything like that I can see why you might not do it but yeah I mean even take I mean taking a one if you're going to take a one week punt on a player son surely is the one that you take the punt on um got some minutes in Europe tonight home game against IP switch I mean's he's arguably the best Captain this this week isn't he if you were free hitting you'd be very tempted to give him the cabin yeah I mean you because he's got the pens right so that's the edge he's got over salanki and koseski and Brennan and that is is the pens um right no well and Johnson I could call him jonno if you like jonno um it's even worse yeah but I I I'm I'm I'm I think that's the that's the step down that people will do it is a step down in price and then you have to obviously get Palmer back once he year fit I don't think it's going to be I think it's a nonissue no question though if you're I think you're right on the wild card if you're wild card in this week like Sam is you go in you go all in on Spurs don't you and then exit out game week 12 surely you go porro salanki and Son don't you if you wild I I I think so unless you're taking Palmer out and losing like triggers put in the in the chat if you're losing like 3 yeah 2 .3 then then I don't think you do but if you haven't owned Palmer like some idiots you and I up until up until now yeah I think I think you definitely go for go for some go fair enough uh let's take on forwards then uh not too much to talk about that I want to talk about J Pedro though he's not high in his table because he hasn't been about he's 23rd .35 X on ped per 90 coming back though with those good fixtures and he then enters the conversation that has been dominated by the likes of himz wood um kuna recently I would say Cal Le but I don't want to keep mentioning him um where do you stand on Jia Pedro do you I mean like I know the algorithm is absolutely love him and they're throwing him at me going he's on pedal is he's gonna you know they love him the models love jaia Pedro um so he's he's going to find his way back into teams isn't he well he'll find his way back into teams but will he find his way back into the team that's the that's the big question that's what I'm asking you as the Brighton f as the expert very brave asking me to predict Brighton I feel like I've completely lost lost my I mean what you know I'm I'm not even going to try and predict what what the what the 11's going to be but what I will say is that we've got some really good strikers for the first time in quite a few seasons who were playing 90 minutes we've got chriswood we've got kuna um you know you could we' got salanki you got Nicholas Jackson with good fixtures you've got vissa you might be keeping Harland these are all you got Welbeck who's playing like every minute as well havs with great arsenal fix You' got so many good fix so many good players do you want to bring in a player who if he starts and he plays for Brighton will score points because he's a great player and he's got penalties but he has such an unbelievable amount of competition that none of those other players have in his position yeah I do think Herz Herz loves him though does he he's he's said things to give us indication that he's he sees him as the man the the player who can turn a game so absolutely but you've got Rutter playing in the 10 at the moment who's been exceptional for about five or six weeks now so I don't think I don't think Joe I think I think he's been I think he's been more than all right I think he's been brilliant I think he's been an excellent player and he's our record signing as well I think it's very harsh if Pedro's fit and comes straight back in and replaces russer I think P I still think Pedro's I've said this all season I'm probably gonna be completely wrong I still think Pedro's best chance of getting into the team is as a nine and and taking the place of Welbeck can taking the place of won't do it it won't happen it will it will not happen this side of Christmas there's no way so he's either taking mat's place on the left or he's taking the 10 we've got O'Reilly back like we've mentioned we've got R who I think has been playing really well you got three players for one position why would you go there when you've got other Strikers who are first choice I mean talking of other options I haven't mentioned either hazards or ISAC but they're they're edging I mean havit with the fixtures he's edging back into the picture isach with a little bit of form how close what would they have to do to get you looking their way esack is is is someone I really want yeah I he's yeah the fixtures are good look right the fixtures are really good and he's he's one of those one of those Strikers on penalties Talisman of the team and I just think Newcastle was just starting to turn a little bit of a corner with the way they're playing football now they they've got kind of a system that's working for they always look a bit more on it um great win against Arsenal to give him a bit of confidence as well and yeah I mean that West Ham game in 12 I know I mean that's the thing is it cuz 12 is the pivot that's where we all probably have two or three transfers and we go Harland out Palmer in and then it's like who comes in for Harland and obviously there's Jackson in the equation there's kuna maybe would but the fixtures are turning isak's got I mean havitz will be in that picture because all right Forest isn't easy but after that it's West Ham United Fulham Everton Palace hit which good run but isak's going to be in that in that you know in a week's time or after the international break when we're sitting here doing this this show then we're going to be talking about where we go and isach and havit are going to be on the menu aren't they well yeah look at the start of the Season we thought isap was going to be in our teams all year there wasn't there wasn't any well there was there was obviously a couple but use the the Cal expression there was very few managers who went without EA game week one and okay it was a great fixture against Southampton at home but the general consensus was he's going to kick on this year and and do really well and it's it's been a combination of newcast not playing well the injury he's had but I mean yeah I I love that kind of Talisman forward for a side and he plays West Ham Leicester and ipswitch in six games as well with brenford thrown in and Palace who he should get chances against too I really like it if you're selling Harland in 12 or 13 um I think eack is is is one one of the best Pi it's just a differential that it'll be and I can say West Ham are probably the worst Premier League side I've seen at the city ground in my time since we've been up I thought that was it was they were so bad I mean I know they were down to 10 men but it wasn't wasn't a lack of they've got good players don't get me wrong but just in terms of the way they were looking around the pitch completely lost no Direction no identity it was so archetype a team that didn't believe in what they were being being told to do or or anything they were doing it was so obvious from just watching the game and Forest were just like well this is Dick this is just we're playing around them and they're not there was just no teamwork no Spirit everything you don't associate with West Ham they are gone unless they get rid of ly and all the talk is I've watched a lot of Le I watched a lot of West Ham stuff after the match because I like to see what they say and they were obviously talking a lot about their own situation as you'd expect and they were saying that they don't think Sullivan will get opy out because of the nature of the how they got him was relationship with the agent and so on and if that's true if Sullivan does drag his feet getting ly out because I I have no doubt it's not going to work I don't see him turning it round West Ham have got to be put in the bracket that we've put the likes of itswitch and Southampton in terms of that's a fixture we need to Target no question could score two or three goals in that game well absolutely and and you look at you look at some of the other teams you look at Everton and they've had spells this season where they've looked all right they're still a team that you wouldn't fancy any given week but they they've got players in the team who can like Harrison like O'Neal like McNeil sorry like I'm not even GNA say Cal Lin but Betto up up top theyve got players in there who can who can under dice you always feel like they've got a system I think Southampton been better last few games they've been playing quite quite well um you know Big Win obviously against Everton and and played pretty decently against against Man City and spells too uh you look at IP switch I think they've got something about them good manager everyone's kind of fighting for the cause I look at all the teams and I think there's positives I look at West Ham and I really struggle to find the positives in that side I look right through the team and think where's the where's the quality there is quality there I mean Kudos is out for another two games that's a blow Bowen is is an exceptional player I mean it's and P Bowen and petta peta's gone though he's he's gone I mean honestly not he's offering nothing to that team but this is the problem right they've got qu if you if you look at West Ham's three best players it's Bowen petta and Kudos yeah Peta when when he's committed but he's not now he's not but same it's the same with Kudos kudus is the same kudus is an unbelievably like talented player but I I don't I wouldn't rely on him every week to put in a eight or nine out of 10 he's he's got an attitude he's got an attitude may be but I think L's got something to do with that lki took him off at halftime at brenford what was that I don't know what was going on so maybe there is off the pitch stuff I'm just saying West Ham is a far easier game at the moment than perhaps people think I mean based on I think W I think West Ham at home if I was picking a player in a game I would want West Ham at home yeah at the moment for my player Spirit wise there it's not it's gone they're gone they're gone they it's such a shame It's like because I want you know they've got good players who could be really useful to us but I yeah I mean that's why isak could be a real big differential game week 12 for sure no question at all um thought we do predictions let's talk about our sponsors as yes so it is sleeper of course we mentioned them already uh the sleeper draft we're playing FPL mate who's top of the league uh in that uh in our in our next game obviously if you're watching or listening to this you can't get involved in that but what you can get involved in uh is the blackbox pick them game which You' probably heard us talk about already essentially if you zap the QR code that's on your screen if you watch this on desktop or there's a link in the description it will take you to sleep app download it completely free enter into the blackbox pickham league and all you've got to do is pick the outcomes of all the games in the Premier League and the person at the end of the month who has predicted the most correct outcomes wins a prize up to the value of £500 so we've given away an Apple Watch a PS5 and a Google pixel I believe phone not yeah yeah we're just taking them for ourselves I've got well uh but yes get involved I know yeah we're just we're SLE bags but yeah get involved and like I said completely free to play you're supporting the stream if you get involved and hopefully you can win a great prize uh too so zap the QR code or use the link in the description uh OE sack I don't know if you're a West Ham fan no quality have great players play yeah absolutely I agree I mean I think I think petta is not the player he was he's unquestionably an absolute quality player kud also I think amazing player Bowen an amazing player they have got I mean obviously Antonio is not what he was so they're struggling up front and I don't think Bowman can play there I totally agree they're just not playing for the manager I I don't I don't think I don't think they've got a great team they got fabianski in goal with Emerson starting Juan basaka I don't think's good enough for a for a the decent side he's not good enough if you're playing three at the back he's good enough if you're playing four at the back but he's playing three at the back and he's asking him to contribute up the field which he can't do as we know so wouldn't take any of them a Brion all right maybe bow I mean was I was shocked by how poor they were cuz I know they're much better than that when I saw them um anyway uh it's getting harder to get this screenshot as this is the lead of order predictions but every week I seem to have to scroll down to find you I don't know what's going on so the table's getting small it's getting smaller font every week as I try and make it long fing yeah 54% I'm on now I'm see I've almost caught hot iron in terms of correct outcome percentage now he's on he's come down to 55 so yeah yeah yeah I mean fair enough you're fresh me on outcomes and score you you're doing really well uh this I think this is this has got to be the first time I've been below 50 because 50% is always our Target isn't it if you're doing if you're at 50% you're doing all right uh and yeah I've dropped below the the magic 50% Mark so I need to I need to get back on it um you do indeed hard season to predict it is uh over 1100 watching we've only got 200 likes what would you say that was you say that was ridiculous as or what would you say that was I would say it's ridiculous this and I'm saying if you're watching this and you haven't and you haven't liked the stream uh you're a ridiculous person so please please do especially if you're a West H fan cuz I love you really I just just think it's a shame um I'm going to see um West H Brighton with fella over Christmas I think it's like the 20th of December or something like that yeah and we got a 50 Quid bet on um on Brighton finishing above West Ham this season I think I mean at the start of season I wouldn't have said it but yeah I think I think you're going to get that now um but I think West H will turn it around but not unless Sullivan gets L out sadly right uh let's go for our our predictions there's no there's no early kickoff Saturday I don't like that I don't like no really kickoff yeah hate that oh it means the leaks could be more prominent couldn't it as well which I don't like oh God Ian there's not exactly many there not I just yeah I don't want all that don't want all that again uh brenford Bournemouth defense straight away interesting you've got 2-1 brenford I've I think brenford are a good team at home and I think bourma for a poor team away from home so I thought this was I thought this was quite a sensible one yeah buar struggling away from home uh I just don't think brenford defensively are good enough to keep them out and I do wonder whether Frank has kind of like I say mve the d a little bit in terms of what he's going to allow them to do in I hope he's learning his lesson and he's going to go back to the fun chaotic brunford of old yeah uh so you've gone one two one one way I've gone two one the other fair enough Palace Fulham difference of opinion here as well you've gone on the way win one nil Fulham I've gone one all want to B yeah yeah I think it's quite an even game um I just think fmer are a better side than than Palace at the moment Palace have got a lot of injuries with wton and and E both outs again not sure when they're when they're back or if they're coming back if they're both out again then they got big problems so I'll back for them winding their sales after their comeback and look at this difference again you've backed West Ham you're going 2-1 West Ham over ever I've gone 21 Everton I just couldn't back Everton yeah I don't know I think I think at home um you know I I think this this was just this was just done by the Home fixture I think if Everton had been at home I'd have gone for an Everton win um I don't think there's much in it between them but West Ham maybe just to just to Nick it and buy him a bit of time before the inevitable sacking in a month no question West Ham and a better side and they have more quality on the pitch but I just I don't know I just think the fight's not there and I think if Everton get one up they'll go two up I think West H might pull one back so that's the narrative I'm going with um set pieces I think as well Everton will cause them problems because we certainly did they didn't look that secure and set pieces defending them um so yeah I think ever will win it probably have a couple of Corners Michael Keane and tarkovski probably or something like that uh w s Anon we both agree on the outcome you've gone 2-1 I've gone 3-1 kuna returns here yeah we haven't talked about kuna um I just did an article about him on on a sports casting where I mean his his stats are are crazy I didn't realize well I didn't hey how many attacking returns he got last season he got 17 um which is incredibly impressive he was averaging 4.7 points which is the same as Bruno Fernandez was last year uh you know I know I know we kind of sag off Bruno a bit but you know still that's an elite player playing for a topish side compared to one playing for a struggling uh wolf side the chances created most chances created of all forwards um I think it's like the third most shots of all forwards as well or something ridiculous like that he's just doing everything everything you you want you forward to be doing he's he's involved with um yeah I think he's going to get something out this game yeah I mean we talked about him didn't we last week in terms of his relationship with the bonus is good because of the chance he's created and plus wolves don't keep it clean sheets so score a goal or or get any kind of a turn and he's straight in the bonus plus he's on penalties they know he's going to be in that discussion when we do the next episode when we're looking at forwards to replace Harland which I'm sure we will be uh fixtures are still good so yeah but this is the fixture to own him for isn't it I mean I I think he comes out of this with potentially double figure return um and maybe Ain Norway gets that clean sheet but we'll see um in Man City you've gone 31 Man City I've got I've given you a point you just don't fancy it what does Chris say what does your dad reckon do you know what I I I don't even I don't even think I I will stick with this when because obviously we still got time to to kind of edit these um I I I think it's 3-1 either way do you how's that for for sitting on the fence I I worry a little bit that we we go for blood against them and we just get like annihilated yeah and caught and foden turns up and Harland I mean they score I'm sure they score no no doubt about that yeah yeah um it's you know it could it's going to be a really good game and it's talk about garden center game this is not the game you want to miss uh this this weekend um but then part of me thinks if we do go out and go for them and and we could actually play them off the park and then if we score a goal early and we get in their heads maybe we do go on and win it fairly comfortably I don't know tricky one I've I'm going to B the pessimism it's the easiest one to do is it it's your own team so I'll back City but yeah I wouldn't be surprised Bri W this uh we got consensus on the 8:00 kickoff Saturday it's Liverpool Villa we've both gone 2 nil routine I think that looks it done it for Me Villa are just something it wrong yeah obviously the traveling is going to I mean this is their third away game in a row having gone to Spurs Bru and now anfield that does take it out of you and they just seem flat don't they and I think obviously Liverpool had the European game as well but I just don't see them slipping up they're not slipping up are they Liverpool no I can't really see anything other than than a routine I mean that I think Villa will they've got the potential to cause problems because they have you know good players but who's going to benefit I think they I think they can kind of put a shackle on on roders and I don't think they'll got caught up with balls over the top like maybe they used to do under under klopp so Watkins might struggle a little bit um yeah I think fairly routin United Leicester you you really are all in on United here aren't here 3-0 well they've scored nine goals All Season they're going to get 30% of that in one game here against a Koopa low block seriously and it it's the first time that um that Leicester won't score All Season against Manchester United uh I'm bought into the amaron hype you really are I think I think the players do you know what there was a lot of criticism about Manchester United against Chelsea I thought they were all right I thought they did all right I think they did enough to to win that game um you know with some of the chances they I think Chelsea were the better side overall but I think United created more opportunities in that match they've won again tonight they should be beating Leicester comfortably with the players they've got so I'm going to back them to do it give rude his his send off I enough and this is interesting Forest Newcastle it's the the only Garden Center game I could pick out of this lot because I'm not going to go Chelsea Arsenal although actually I do think in terms of spectacle Chelsea Arsenal will probably be pretty dull um and the predictions we've gone we've kind of backed that up you've gone three2 to Forest I've gone one all three2 do you know what five goals in this you think Chris Wood hatrick he did it last year at St James he did he did and there's some players with some beef with Newcastle we've got we've got Chris Wood obviously got the hatrick at St James's part last year we got alango who they were after and we didn't let go to Newcastle they came in with 50 million right at the death and we said no so alanga would want to play up and see if he can tempt them again in January and we've got aliot Anderson who obviously was let go and they didn't want to let him go yeah good he's a fantastic player so we've got we've got three of our most important and influential players with something to play for here but Newcastle will turn up with a bit of form yeah I I I I think it'll be a very good game in terms of it being a tactical battle I don't know if there'd be a lot of goals but you think is I'm very very surprised very surprised you've gone 3 to um I think one all is a much more realistic outcome and I think if you do need to get down that Garden Center this is probably the only game I would I would recommend I am going to this um oh yeah nice I'm probably going to have the worst Journey ever because it's ra Replacement Service those dreaded free words no so I don't know how I'm going to get home um bigger fan than I am I can't I can't not go even if it's on telly because of obviously Forest are just riding a crest of a wave aren't they so I've got to go um look at this agreement Spurs it which I mean this is not very often we go the same on a score line like this we both gone 4-0 which makes me think I need to be taking salanki Captain more seriously than I am is if you trip triple up on the Spurs and the salanki captain tempting isn't it but you you just think there's no way here that they don't just fres it which right well realistically they shouldn't they they're a great team at home and we've shown the stats today Spurs are the top attacking side in the league it switch to the bottom defensive team in the league so there's absolutely there's nothing to suggest that Spurs won't won't win this they are when you watch them and when they're in full song and sanki has been an unbelievable signing if you take FPL out of the equation what he gives to that team and the way he brings others into the in terms of pressing yeah yeah it's no wonder that they're so H because he presses high he links up the play really well brings in the Wingers who are really effective especially with sbach now they've got even more of a weapon obviously on on the left and I I can't see any way up switch have any have anything to be able to deal with them so indeed Daniel how the turns have tabled exactly it's like only a couple of weeks ago we were like oh kalanki got to go is he but now you know I was saying this to Sam earlier when when Johnson scored I sent a really like pissy message to to yell was like I'm so stupid I should have gone for Johnson over sank I'm so annoyed with myself and all this and then how quickly things turn around and now we predicting 4-0 and I'm going to Captain him so FPL is a funny game Chelsea Arsenal you've gone nil nil I've gone one nil I think Arsenal will just grind this out I think this will be a set piece goal and then they just frustrate Chelsea I I I do think clean sheets are coming back into the Arsenal Armory again and I think this will be the first one obviously as a non-pma owner we're probably both biased and this could be a three all draw with Palmer all in but I just don't see it being that kind of match nor do you by a look of it no I think Arsenal can can contain Palmer when when he starts and I'm sure he will uh it's the kind of game isn't it where like he just it's the kind of game which the Chelsea Arsenal and I think I think it said Manchester United Chelsea was like the most nil Nils in premier league history or something like that these kind of bigger games I always go into it with a bit of an expectation that it's going to be a bit of a ball Fest and Arsenal Liverpool was the exception because that was two and there was lots of goals in that but I think this is going to be a a nil nil or a one nil eitherway thought you say so yeah Matt and FY fimy joyd are both doubting the Spurs clean sheet but I I refer The Honorable gentleman to the attacking data which you know it switch a 0.86 XG non penalty per 90 that is incredibly poor so yes they've got the lap but I think what's the what's the lap in terms of goal involvement have we got that on here we haven't but I think his goaling go is something like 70% so you stop dap it which don't score and obviously dap could could score for them and that could be a factor but I think the the logic behind the Spurs clean sheet isn't the the robustness of the Spurs defense it's the powder puffiness of the it switch attack right well the one weapon it switch do have is leaf Davis from corner and you're benching I'm benching him but if they're going to score if if if ifs swi score I bet it's from a corner from a leaf Davis Corner well yeah I mean Vicario and the Spurs defense are all over the shop aren't they for those God they're so bad set pieces they so they saw it from against Villa just viaro just doesn't know how to how to claim him he's he's a great keeper otherwise but he really struggles in that area okay that's our predictions let's have a look briefly at the captaincy um it's a tough one isn't it really because there's a there's a real spread because we're going to have the Harland owners we're going to have the the Salah owners and then we're going to have those who are going to go off the wall and go maybe a salanki or even an mumo maybe um and it's lovely to see I I I sit here now and think yeah there's going to be a real when I when I check people's teams like I do 11:00 or whatever uh on Saturday I will see a spread of captains across all those that I look at I think it's this is exactly what we wanted what we're going to have we perhaps further on I think so I think I think we'll see Harland I think we'll see Salah do you think it'll be majority Salah do you I think you'll see all Salas I think it's going to be Salah Salah Salah sal sal it does make me wonder I mean Bruno yeah of course mentioned in chat there on Matt does make me wonder whether I should go against that and go Harland or even salanki because there's no question that those three players could let's have a look at Rob's graphic because I think that could tell us a bit more Rob T at robt fbl do follow because he does some excellent stuff and this is just a sample um this is basically showing the um spread betting expected goals and expected clean sheets odds expected goals top of this is Spurs to 2.90 then it's United 2.45 Liverpool 2.35 City are out at 2.05 so not in the top three in terms of surprised it's that way around for Liverpool City I thought you know given it's Villa and there are you know top sixish side and the fact that we going to conc H of a lot of chances more than likely I thought that would be the other way around but interesting does that make you think that I mean that that cements Salah but it also says Salan is the Tilt right I just I sometimes I just feel that you know we do these podcasts we look at all these data we look at all these stats we spend however many hours a week looking at Stats and drilling down and we have evidence to say that we've got the best attacking team in the league versus the worst defensive team in the league with a player who's just scored 16 points scored again in the Europa League tonight clearly okay I don't know clearly now got something about him wind in his sales we've got Salah with a fairly trick which could be a fairly tricky I think he still returns but it could be a fairly tricky game for him we got har bang off form I'm going for sanki I am very very tempted because I think you're right it's like how often do we have the worst attack against the worst defense with the with the confidence that way the only thing that makes me concerned is you look at the Spurs attack and it could come from anywhere it could come from Brennan it could come from son it could be kesi um it could be Madison I mean Madison will surely play this game so so what I do know is that Spurs won't let up it won't it you know you look at city and Liverpool if they go 2N up you wouldn't say they're going to run up 45 nil if Spurs go two-nil up it could easily be 4 five because an won't stop he'll keep coming yeah raton's injured y so did salanki start tonight I was be very no no it came off lank started and got sent off oh okay so charlton's injury for me that made me more interested in sank because I don't see sank getting subbed because who comes on and plays that Central role and if anything think son's going to get subbed because he's back from injury uh Johnson might get subbed you know Mickey Moore might come on on the right he's as well is he right so so Johnson's probably 90 minutes as well then yeah okay I mean Johnson's a fun one he's on this list as at list as well um we know ipswitch are weaker down that that side isn't the leaf Davis side it's Ben Johnson isn't it I think he's been playing for for IP switch I wouldn't trust Johnson then again I wouldn't trust it's a funny one isn't it it is Brennan against Leaf Davis is um because Brennan's right side up against the left side oh okay then I yeah I fav that less then yeah so it's well it's son up against Ben Johnson then yeah if I if I if I had son I'd be very tempted or if I even if I didn't have son I had a route to to get him um I'd be very tempted by that I mean the flip side his Leaf davus does get forward and so Brennan could get behind him um I think he beats him for Pace Brennan yeah I mean I we've both predicted 4-0 so you've got to think that even if sanki doesn't come out as a top scorer here he's going to get a return um son I guess is the player to go for with the penalties as well I'm I'm I am now depending on what videos I watch on Friday night I'm gonna go salanki so if I watch if I watch anything on salanki or Spurs or AB adct which I probably will go that way if you see a video of do slon with a sausage dog that's going to be it isn't it I know yeah that's all he's got to do that's all he's got to do I'm so I'm so open to persuasion on this one that's for sure um if not I'll just play safe with s but it's it's lovely to have a TT isn't it because yeah I mean that's a big tilt on your part for four with yeah well let's have a look at our teams um for it as oh Ry in goal I'm envious yeah Ray is Ray is in goal Al it's not I hope that nil nil comes through your one nil prediction but a little bit une easy it's Raya Trent Gabrielle and Moreno uh as the defensive four it's foden for one more week before I move over to Palmer uh because I've got the money which I'll talk about in a sec it's inmo it's garnacho little bit worried now seeing as Amad has come on and scored two goals in the Europa League uh Rogers he's got the yellow flag but he played in the champion so he's going to be fine and it's harand slanky captain and I did Watkins out for kuna you got kuna that's nice that's nice I do like that team yeah yeah I like it I gu I guess Rogers G at foden you know they're um it's a it's a it's a team which has potential to do really [ __ ] because if if sanki blanks and Salah goes off um and obviously fen's a bit of a gam I'm playing Rogers against Trend I've got double Arsenal defense if Chelsea score yeah I don't know it's it's a team which I it's not IDE like I'm seeing Sam's wild card team for example I'm thinking God it looks strong with Salah saaka and Palmer all in there but then Palmer and saaka playing each other um yeah I know I'm I'm I'm happy to own kuna though the plan was always to get to get kuna I was going to do um Harland and dibling out for Salah and kuna but then I wouldn't have had the money to get Palmer right so you can go Palmer in in what can you go Palmer in one move next yeah so I can do F to Palo next week for so you're not going to go s at all no you're going to hold Harland and not go Salah well harand might be coming in for I I might be doing harand to Salah in in 13 um when when they play each other but it will be Holland over Salah for the next two salah's got Southampton game at 12 yeah but Holland's Got Spurs at home I'd expect him to do something in that and and I'm cting Palmer anyway against Leicester so Salo Liverpool High press against s an oh I know there but then if I go for if I go for Salah then I'm not gonna have Palmer so there's there's always goingon to be someone that I'm gonna be I'd rather have Salah at santon than Palmer at Leicester well I can't afford so I can't afford s in one move so it's gonna have to be Palmer um I do have another free transfer though to use uh I don't really want to play Rogers away I I am I I yeah but what you think so well I was I was thinking of maybe moving for a United Defender and bringing in mazari or do um maybe even for Lewis because if I'm not playing Lewis this game I'm not playing him against Spurs and then I'm not playing him against Liverpool when when I I'm when am I going to play him what about 8 Nori says FB Forest yeah I mean eight nor is fine but they're not they're not keeping clean sheets and you know I I I don't think he's gonna go I know but I don't think he's going to go on and get 20 attacking returns I mean I I could I could I could do Lewis to I could do I could do Lewis to someone I don't know but I quite like the idea of just saving the transfer cuz there's there's not many clean sheets around anyway um Rogers could get something against against Liverpool at least I've got some stake in the game if Trent loses clean sheet so as I'm a little bit tempted by Lewis to um to mazra or d a little bit a little bit tempted M agre I like that one I don't I mean Leicester to score Old Trafford seems remote to me I just think Cooper is going to low block there won't be much ambition I yeah yeah I think Del could go on as well but if if if amam does come in and change the system and and Del playing Wing back I think he could be a really really strong option so there's a py that wants to do it I'm I'm not I don't know I'm 5050 see how I feel comment of the night nooski as your team is not good I see 40 points yeah perfect cheers nooski is there a prize for comment of the night we should have that really if if if sank gets a couple of goals and foden and foden turns up it it's not going to be a midlin result this it's going to be either absolute disastrous cuz I can see Chelsea scoring I can see Newcastle scoring I can see Villa scoring I Strangely I think Trent is your best bet for a clean sheet yeah um I can see foden getting an hour and DEA getting half an hour and foden coming off I can see I mean salanki should be right I can see gacha and Rogers blanking kuna should be right you do maybe it is a middling team maybe it's not foden foden harand slanky kuna that there's those four they're going to with this team this week I tell you what though I think I can catch you this week but it isn't going to be down to fleen fle that's that's your old team so that's a good start that's my is it that's your that's your old team yeah uh Sal against Brighton slanky against oh God it is what's going on here let me uh I don't in that case and I don't think I've got my team let me try uh what am I goingon to do now then uh let me see if I can grab my team you'll have to keep talking while I try and do this show can't even show the right I thought I thought i' grabbed my team that's really odd I don't know how I can do this now can you can you go back to my team then I can just talk through that a bit more yeah uh sorry about that I thought I'd got that right but clearly not um do you know what I I knew I knew that this team was going to get slated by by people this week because it's got players in it that not a lot of people have have got but I've seen enough from har and foden to think they're both still good options like I said I think they're going to we're going to concede chances to them if gacho plays he's playing Leicester I still think he's a good pick should have got more in that in that game slanky Captain's fun [ __ ] is a good good option Rogers Rogers really is the weakest link um in this side this week um which is why is tempting to move to to a dow or a or a mazari um mazra the reason why I keep mentioning mazari by the way is not because I I think he's a better option than Dow it's just the money uh masro is 45 I think Dow is 51 there's a point 6 difference between them and if I am going to be looking to get you know sacker in in the future or something like that I'm probably going to need that money the one thing is when it comes to gameweek 13 and I move Harland out um I might also be tempted to move Trent out as well and that's going to free up a lot of money so that tempts me into just going for do because I think in a few weeks I might have some more money in the bank any um I can't grab my team because I forgotten what the screenshot I'm on a Mac and I don't know what the screenshot button is uh and uh it's too complex to do um so we're just gonna have to just gonna have to talk through my team I'm afraid so sorry about this great if you're on the podcast not great if you're on the stream um unless anyone knows what the screenshot button is on the on the Mac but I I don't use the Mac often enough to know um I'm sure there'll be some this why I hate Max always something ridiculous isn't it and then I can't I can't get the bloody bench in either because it's too it's the wrong format I'm trying just bear with me and I do this hold on three times and do a forward roll and that'll get you a or something something weird Apple up three I mean everyone's saying different things yeah I know I've got it command shift three now I don't know how to get it into the stream let me just see if this works uh let me just go on I don't know how this happen I love that everyone's posting different commands for a screenshot no one's put the same one twice no I can't do it I can't do it it's no good can't do it uh right so my team is I just have to talk for it sorry for people on the on the stream um it's you're going so well Mark until you got [ __ ] I know it was going well yeah um so my team is just for the podcast and for people listening it is GNA be God this is a disaster it is fleen Trent Gabrielle porro Lewis mumo Johnson Salah ameno Harland and salanki um so I've benching Rogers at the moment do I play Lewis or do I play Rogers that's the question I I think they both get one to two points so I think you probably play the attacker oh you did it yeah there we go but I'm dragging it into the wrong screen if anyone would like a little bit of a window into to what it's like doing these with Mark this is it it's I can't do it it's all broken no no no no no two minutes later I've done it I've yeah this is you every week every week it's really blurry though it's not good quality but it's the best I could do so yeah fleen Trent Gabrielle porro Lewis in Johnson Salah Captain seeno maren salanki do I play Rogers over Lewis and do I captain salanki are the two questions I'm not going to make a transfer because I need to save the two for gameweek 12 um with the Palmer question in mind I am I think I think you I think you play Rogers I think you play the it's it's it's 5050 between I think you go you go for the I mean City can seeed again don't they that's the thing it's it's just I don't back Villa to score either so it's not like yeah no but what's more likely Villa score or city don't concede yeah I don't know that's close I mean Liverpool are the best defensive side and I don't think vill in great shape and and not only a villa got a score but Rogers has got to have something to do with it whereas I think it's sorry I I mean I mean City could get your clean sheet but then Lewis may not get you know may not start or may not even get the hour needed to get the clean sheet as well that's the other thing he could be subbed at half time now pep so they haven't got the the fit squad though you got to think Lis will start but yeah I I just it's easier to score a goal than it is to keep a clean J for 90 minutes yeah that's very true and Brighton will probably score yeah maybe it is better to go with the attacking player um again I'm open to persuasion Friday night to see what happens but yeah I think I think you're right I probably will go on the attack I do like the salanki captain cuz I've got harand and Salah covered so therefore the damage that they can do in terms of if they haul is minimized by the fact I own them both whereas going salanki is a big differential and if he did come in with another double figure that would be a big swing in my favor yeah I think this I think you could overtake me this week because there's not a lot wrong here is there are the trip I think poo could easily get a double figure if he gets SP if Spurs win that 4-0 and porro and Johnson both get returns yeah yeah I've got you I've got you you're in my sights we'll see the Rivalry this is the deciding season as well isn't it not it's going to be that last one but it's two all so this is no this is it no whoever wins this black box finishes at the end of this season so you've had enough you've had enough of the Tantrums and the technical problems enough of the Tantrums enough of bloody people in the chat having a go at me about Barco it's over I saw that was that was there some serious Barco backlash I know people been a bit dick in the in the chat tonight so I've given a few people a timeout so they can think about what they've done okay all right I don't I don't know why people have to bring Barco up when was I it it wasn't it wasn't about Barco yeah put you on a timeout next time you yeah exactly um so yeah it's all to play for isn't it I I do think this is what I said a few weeks back you know it's much more enjoyable season we're not doing brilliantly and not many content creators are it's a rarity that you see a content creator flying this season but um I don't think many content creators will say that it's not a better season as in terms of what's on offer from the game right I love it I think it's great and you know I I like the fact people look at my team and think it's it's crap because I look at it and think there's potential there with with foden and uh and kuna and sanki Captain and you know everyone's team is going to be different and everyone is going to be biased to think that players they haven't got in their team aren't as good because that's why we've picked the players that we've got and not gone for the for the other ones um so yeah it's fascinating there's going to be people and in a few weeks there's going to be people with teams without sacka and then people are going to say why is your team got sacka and it's like because I've got Palmer and sah and harand and yeah it's it's it's really interesting at the moment we're seeing like certain premium players dropping in form and things it's going be when we've got if we get if we get to a point where we've got son saaka Palmer Harland and Salah all delivering points and then you got HTS and eak as well that and Watkins maybe yeah it's it's amazing it'll be a great State of Affairs I think the Defenders not keeping clean sheets has has changed things as well because we're flashing money out and the four five ain't nor is suddenly a hot property which you know I love it I love that as well it's great yeah yeah we've got one super chat from at boy to address before we go um thank you very much for the six year that boy and for your you're always there in chat thank you for all your support you always a a support of the show um great showers do you avoid starting a Defender that plays one of your attackers I own vardy and have to have to start Ana or Maz rui so vardy is at United um does he start Maz RI a think you have to don't you I mean I know what he's saying there don't you I mean an I love obviously I do think we could concede there's a there's a world in which we win one nil for sure cuz Newcastle aren't scoring a lot of goals and we are very strong defensively and it could be one of those games where one goal decides it so Ana might not be a Bad Bet at all it's not a bad choice to go Ana but I do think United clean sheet against Leicester is probably the most likely outcome don't you as I love that question because that's exactly what I asked you earlier is how much has that kind of impact on it and ideally you'd play mazari and not think twice about it because it's a home game you didn't have V yeah yeah but then you've got vardy and you're thinking well I want vardy to score and then if he does score I don't want to be annoyed when mazari L his sheet I think it would it depends on my belly for a risk wouldn't it if I mean where I am now I probably would go vard and and Ana and go you know because or you bench or you bench vardy and play mazari and Ana yeah i' maybe think about that yeah I yeah I I don't think but then's got penalties isn't he that's the thing yeah I just don't know I mean like they will low block and they will counter and vardy has got that Turner pace and you maybe United go there go High Line and yeah vard I think I'd play I think I'd play vardy and mrai because I think there's all I think either way you're going to either get points from vardy or mazwi um because if ler score it'll be through vardy and if they don't the mai score so I think i' I think I'd lean towards that but yeah close yeah good good one at booy very good question which kind of chimed with what we talked about tonight good show as thank you for that um thank you for the 1200 still watching and all the support tonight wow amazing and um yeah I I think this is my favorite season for three or four years I think possibly right up there with one of my favorites so far I really hope it stays on this vein and I really hope our teams remain aart um not just our teams but everyone out there as well um yeah and um yeah it's just a much more enjoyable season for it so um looking forward to what this week brings I go into every game week thinking this could be one extreme or the other whereas last season it was like it'll be another small red or small green whereas now it could be a big red or a big green or you know something extreme like that and and me and you are really tussling for the ranks now so yeah I know I'm glad you you you've closed the Gap makes it more interesting I mean that's the thing I I spent so long last season like even at like 3 million in the first 10 weeks I was like 3.2 million 2.9 Million 3.4 million and like that like it's I'm exactly the same rank as what I was like four weeks ago but it's been like 800k 1.4 million 500k yes I you know yeah it's been it's been a lot more it's been a lot more interesting and you know I think it when you see a player like sank gets 16 points and you look at your rank and you see the impact it's had and it's like wow he's not actually that highly owned because people have put so much money into Salah and Haren they can't afford salanki you know you got good managers without without players like salanki because they can't they've gone a different route which is also completely viable and we'll pay off in in different weeks um but yeah every strategy is going to have its time to shine and yeah it's comms in which one was the one which will be which was the correct one yeah Bring it on Bring on another game week maybe R it maybe green but we'll enjoy it anyway hopefully we keep saying that throughout the season thank you again for everyone who joined in tonight we'll see you soon hit the like if you enjoyed it hit the Subscribe if you're new around here let me just let me just put that up look I've got the animation I've hard to use it there it is there we go oh look at that beautiful oh no beautiful and uh we'll

International break on know we'll get through it's the last one we'll get through it together and then plane sale into the end and Christmas fixtures yeah it's a good night for me good night everyone [Music] [Music] [Music] for,28295,good evening everyone welcome to fbo blackbox ahead of gw 11 my name is asz and look at that mark we are bang on time for the first time i dont know god knows bl is so surprised i look at pangy in there my god thats on time its its the new its a new software were using which is a lot slicker means im a bit calmer i didnt throw any headphones this week i had to get a new webcam though because my webcam broke last night you so nearly did a whole week of like no stress and then last night its as my webcam is broken i need to get an order on i dont if its going to arrive in time its so here we go it was it was so tranquil nothing straightforward it anyway thecam minutes before 10 minutes before we start were in were on time beautiful green arrows as well come on go youve closed the gap though havent you massive week for you massive well talk about that in a bit what else are we going to talk about tonight we got we got some stuff on amar we talk about his new tactics what we can expect three amazing fixures for them coming up so well talk a bit about those ive already got one in my side i might be getting another one so well see what tonight brings on that we got to talk about big dom big dom sanki getting his 16o return making a lot of people very happy near making me very sad cuz i do how close i was to selling him have i told you i know i cant believe it you were going to do what you were going to do dom to ry gimenez right i was going to do dom to gimenez and i had it on confirmed transfers and i did a poll i did a poll on twitter which said something like who scores more than x2 salanki or gimenez and i think it was like 65 him anders people said seriously and i looked it and i thought theres lots i could do with that money i want to be moving to palmer in the future salahs a player that i want i can take some money out and go for him and is i would be sick to my stomach if i had done that move so glad i didnt id be id be id be beating you if youd have done that you would be my godar me imagine that i cant believe you were that close to doing it as well i we did talk about it didnt we because we talked about salanki last week and you said you on the verge of giving up on him and i said i said we got to hold him for the h switch game surely and arent we glad we did because now he goes into that game as what i looked at the betting odds that rob t put up and hes like the third favorite scorer this game week and our teams look pretty good with salanki in there so commiserations to anyone who mov this week is he you going to cat on him right spoiler early spoiler know i know come from g from selling him to captain its a funny old game and if you look at the fixures hes had brighton west ham i switch to come the game that i didnt hold out much h for was this was this villa game and it seemed like the logical one to sell him on but you called it last time you said villa have looked a bit a bit ropey struggling a bit with the champions league the underlying stats in defense were good but starting to tire a bit and i thought spurs were brilliant in that match and rightfully blew them away so it should be a big youve got three spurs assets going into whips swit i know i me its funny isnt it because last week when i got porro and johnson in it looked like ive made a fa parkers they went to paris and they were miserable i didnt expect the returns i didnt expect big returns in the paris game but i thought i might get something but it was always with the vi the home games in mind the three home games that they got in four and but i wasnt expecting the big returns in the villa game so itd be just like it would be spursy wouldnt it if they like drew one and lip swis s got the goal surely not we have got over 400 joining us already and theres european football going on and chelsea what they what six seven8 nil up by now i dont know they were 6 n up after 42 minutes against the armenian minnows that they were playing six nil at halim exactly no cole palmer in that game of course we will all touch on cole palmer but just to give a shout out to those in the chat tonight thank you for joining us thats paul signs thats henn fbl forest you sexy beast nicholas kill tristan cox tony g mr lucian emu show connor richardson i am 1974 at a boy fbo yellow army good evening davis family first tony g j keeg theyre all in tanky no sign of nigel yet im sure hes there in the background just hasnt commented yet thank you for joining us on a thursday night 900 well be going up to probably 11 knowing us maybe a little bit more if theres any super chats in there we will get to them of course of course lets get on with this by hitting your game week mr as your first 53 points talk us through it god youre getting into this like streamer hosting lck you reading names hitting my team i cant wait till the smash and like ill do a bit of that in a minute off to go t is all right week 53 points ryer and trent the two premium defenders who a lot of people have got disappointing each and every week with three and two with the one moreno finally making past the halfway line was nice to see and ana on the on the other side its nice to see the fullbacks finally doing a bit of bit of attacking it was morenos best display from an attacking point of view had an amazing display against salah anfield but going forward last weekend he was just very confident taking players on it was great to see it looks like hes like enjoying being in the side isnt he like you see his celebrations after the games and hes like acting for the players and there real quality like there and i think with ana as well on the other side theyre theres no reason why they should be shackled because they can offer a lot going forward so i think moreno at 44 is a good purchase i think if you offer me the switch to ana id probably take it hes a little bit more but im pretty happy with mor how minkovich didnt score though no well talk about him later right he had one past the post and then the brilliant sa by fabianski for the one that anderson play back to him its coming for him for sure the issue with my defense though was i bought in leaf davis to play him in two games what you thinking here tell talk me through the logic of that you b you have leave davis surely you have to play him in the home games well the logic was im not im going to play trent on i trents going to play im g to play moreno at home to west ham so there was one spot and it was between ls gabrielle and davis but did you think that city would keep a clean sheet at bournemouth i two clean sheets at all season i didnt think any three of them would and the issue was i just thought it was i just thought it was a loss it was probably which one has probably the best chance of the clean sheet in these three and i thought it probably see but when youre talking about leaf davis its got to be whos the best one for attacking returns is it if you didnt think take clean sheets out of it whos more likely to get you an attack in return leaf davis or l okay if you if you if you if you can tell me that you were expecting leaf davis to score a left footed volley from the corner of theen area into the into the corner it happened what they all concede it thats what i thought would happen and i think it was its just a lottery isnt it lewis could have scored a goal if hed started from outside the penalty era gabrielle could have headed one in from a set piece i dont know it was it was a mistake is top for chances created of all defenders but they havent got any strikers that can score ill give you that i dont know it was it was probably it was probably the wrong move i it was the wrong move give the points and i wish i had played him because i i bought i had him for the these two games i had him for everon at home and lester they were the two games i was going to play him in and i went against that thing but so thats nine points lost which does hurt but anyway played rogers though played rogers played rogers i was i was happy with that with his with his nine foden again i dont know how he blanked in that match hes hes now the second highest for xg involvement over the last two game weeks just behind harland who also planked again inuma garach how did garo not get a return against chelsea because hes very wasteful thats why i know but my god he had two great chances in that game harand blanked i dont know how he blanked in that watkins had a great oneonone opportunity against spurs and put it wide and luckily i was bailed out by sanki cuz without him with salah scoring and other things going on it wouldnt have been a very good week so it was it was a funny week it was a week where i think it could have been better if i played davis foden got something gach got something ifs woods and buts but green arrow fen had that chance second half that he put wide it was a good shot that and hes he scored in midweek of course so its coming for foden theres no doubt its just how long you hold him against the options out hes got one more week one more week for me heroic doses says as if it makes you feel better i did play davis but i bench salanki bench salanki i dont think that makes me feel better makes me feel a bit makes me feel a bit sick mr or mrs doses what did you have up front that meant you bench salanki i want to know we all want to know put that in chat ill look out for it lets bring my team up shelby because its a green arrow its a big one 75 do we have to fleen fleen were talk we talk about him shall we that was absolutely painful some fbl gold between us though wasnt it because when he when the clean sheet went in you said to me when do you think hell break your heart and it was inevitable i was like well it always what always happens is you wait until they got maximum bonus and thats when they concede you wait until they hit peak points and he got maximum bonus and then he started getting more saves and he was on for 12 conceded one only fell to eight and i was like what ill take the eight three bonus with the 10 say perfect and i thought to myself the only way hes going to lose the free bonus now is if he lets another one in and this is with what 30 seconds to go and they played another minute of stoppage time and he let the second one in it was funny watching because obiously youve got him i havent and i went for ray im paying more and its been painful owning ry over the last few and i was i joked you i sent you the message and said how long till fleen loses it and as the game started going on i started getting more and more nervous that it wasnt going to happen and he was just going to go on and get this absolutely mammoth hall and i dont know when they scored it was funny cuz because youd said to me whens he going to the pet and then you were watching the stream but youre a little bit ahead of me and so then i just got the message from you saying yep hes absolutely sh and then as i read it i saw him concede and i was like believable it was i was prepared for it so it wasnt as devastating as perhaps it would be for others and id had a good game we so i could take it if i had a bad way game week i think id have had to say to pip i just go out we need some more milk then just gone for a walk for two hours at like 1000 at night just invented a reason to get out the house and be alone there must be people out there who if you didnt have slanking if you didnt have salah maybe even have johnson bench im sure theres going to be people out there who had rogers on the bench sorry not johnson rogers on the bench no salanki no salah and had fleen and saw that hall and saw the green arrow and was like thank god i got a player bringing something home and then sorry if thats you dear me anyway fleen four trent two gabrielle 2 porro one miserable in defense ino 3 and here it comes rogers nine johnson 8 salo 18 seeno chow was the captain of course seeno 10 harland two salanki 16 the fact that i played seeno over lewis raised a few eyebrows and of course raised suspicions of we got a leak i knew people think that the thing is i was on the train to notam i had no signal and i was like try to get a signal to message in whatsapp and say people are going to think this arent they when i just like all the team news was coming in and so on and i was like i was surprised that more people didnt play so many i was surprised how many teams did bench de bench him i was pretty shocked that i was he was such a differential because i always thought city would concede and then like whos most likely get the goal but what was funny one of the reasons i played him and this is i shouldnt be affected by this but i was on on friday night i was waiting for the embargo team news to come through and it came through from pep about ive got a few injuries so that spooked me a bit and i thought well we dont know who those injuries are and he said to like youll find out i was like brilliant thank you so i didnt think lewis would be injured but i thought that perhaps thered be more injuries and then city more likely to concede so i thought ill play some meno if theyre going to be weakened but the other thing that made me play him was there was a interview with him on bbc on the bbc website which i presume was on football focus and on it he talked about setting a goal target and when its just recency biased i watched it and thought hes a good player and he he could get fit and i was i was talking myself into playing him and thats that was played into it as well and its just weird out those little things like if you read an article or someone there someone just brings a player to mind you could be on twitter could you just bre through twitter and that could be the thing that just makes you go when its so close and it was like the difference between seeno rogers lewis when i looked and gabrielle when i looked at review because i was looking at review and they were all about between 3 four 37 expected points but when its like that its like well its down to me theres not theres not enough in it where the algor the model going to help so i just went on my biases which was well i dont trust pep and i think city will city will let one in at least and they let two in so two things on that firstly you could have given me the tip off that lewis was benched that would have been i didnt know he was bench did i of course you didnt you think im that im glad city wasnt the first kickoff because it would have been even worse wouldnt it imagine if we both bench lewis imagine if i had bench lewis for for davis would have got absolutely slated for being in the old cartel i wanted to ask say for example you had to play lewis this week because youve got no ged to say gabrielle was a was a d okay doesnt work with this example but say you were playing lewis this week would that make you less likely to want to play seeno what if i was playing lewis and seeno in the same it would because i hate that i hate so do i so that was the other factor it was like i was always going to play gabrielle over lewis because i felt the goal threat from gabrielle is far greater and i thought that e i thought well maybe arsenal will concede city will concede so its then go threat so its always gabrielle and i was pretty certain he was going to play gabrielle i dont think there was i dont think there was much doubt going into the game week that gabriel was going to start based on what wed heard and what arteta had said not that you can trust arteta but so it was never a choice between gabriel and lou it was always do i go three at the back or four at the back and bench seeno so its or leou thats the nine points that i lost out on my leaf days i just dont dont get why you weve le it was it which not likely to score is what were your think because i played him at home to everton and they lost 30 that was that was honestly that was the fixture right i should have i its not okay were on your team now we dont need to do the whole thing on lea davis but that is going to sting i think for a while that move but when i cant i cant so i just i cant believe pep said one player we cant rest is ric its funny everyone said didnt they in the week that means hes benched for sure i didnt think that i didnt think for one minute lewis wouldnt start it was just most likely get me some points but i was surprised how many played lewis and how many owned some meno i sold a lot of people sold seeno as well he was a mwe for palmer and so i was surprised he was such a differential when i got a signal and i finally flick in through teams i was like blame me s meno could work out and he did which was great so last a bit of luck he is the dominant player for them and its a good time to look at the ticker balmer fixtures now brenford brighton wolves those three in particular very strong from an attacking standpoint theyll probably concede but having seeno for those for that runs pretty good and it doesnt theyre fifth on the ticker here over the next 12 i say who impressed me that was kirz with a two he was cuz i had him i had him last season do you remember when everyone went for zabani and i was like ill take the punt on kirz thatll be fun misses out in the first double game week zabani scores and then they then they concede that was so you talk you talk about theres little things like kirkus i look at him think you let me down that time it wasnt even its not his fault he didnt get picked but i still look at him think that was that was your fault but i think kirk stats are good we going to talk about a bit later but hes another one four 43 is theres some decent options emerging around like the four the four fiveish bracket and the thing is its like no clean sheets but i think youve got to just consider the attack and return potential now theres no clean sheets anywhere no not even arsenal now as were were going to touch on its its now about which defenders are most likely to get you something in the in the attacking third because finding defenders who can get you clean sheet like in fact vardia was now described as the better option over lewis which is crazy because its like its leis is cheaper and so hes the cheaper route into the city defense but because all we care about is attacking returns because weve given up on clean sheets you go bario and its its weird it if like people saying now which city defender theyd say aio even though he cost more because lewis is only getting you clean sheets he might get assists youll probably get one goal maybe two over the season but v is unquestionably the more attacking of those two and now thats all we care about because was it two clean sheets for city and i dont think theyre coming anytime soon brighton spurs liverpool theyre not going to keep a clean sheet in any of them games i dont think no and is a problem with lewis because hes hes 47 48 hes his place is at risk each week i expect him to play most games but he will get the odd he will he will miss the od game when walker comes in he hasnt got as good attacking threat as some of the defenders around his priz and hes not keeping clean sheets as well so its the thing im playing him each week because hes a man city defender im trying to im thinking okay this is statistically one of the best defenders in the league and one of the best teams in the league and its im im losing out to players like leaf davis and eight nory and kirz and lewis hall and stuff who also arent getting clean sheets but have a bit more going forward hes becoming a troll he is like i look at him i probably will have to play him this week because i dont want to play rogers and field but maybe i should because city at brighton again i feel like theyre going to concede lewis probably isnt going to get an attack in return so what am i looking at a one or two point i might as well play rogers and roll the dice maybe but i dont know ill make up my mind later in the week maybe ill read an article about rogers and be convinced by that again but thats what it takes when its so close you just it is in a way you can when youre in my position well go against the eo and go well if the player with lower ownership go with that person but out of lewis and rogers theres not much in it is there so the one cave i would say on the strategy of going with what players are saying about themselves is dont forget nicholas bner who was the most arrogant if you went by purely by that hed be your captain every week because of how well he spoke about himself but the thing is seeno had a sausage dog as well and he was nice in the video and its stupid isnt it because you start thinking what a nice guy and hes got hes got a dog like mine and and then 10 minutes later the pep stuff comes out and then lo and behold im going now im going to start some menu and of course that must have fed into its so weird i dont know but it is it is youve got to be careful what you expose yourself to when youre looking at your fbl lineup because if youre on twitter too much or you read too much or you watch a video the biases come through dont they and you got to be aware of that and it could often go completely wrong the antithesis of harland for you who you dont feel dont speak so highly of i should have just stuck with my guns not gone on twitter and made up my own mind but the fomo was made worse by all the ferar about the hat tricks and everything you read about when i didnt have harland there was all this talk of him getting what 40 goals this year suddenly thats all evaporated no ones got him anymore im looking at everyones team everyone him and everyones talking about chris wood like all the pundits and everything chris woods getting all the attention about like isnt it marvelous how the oldfashioned number nine and suddenly the talk of harland has completely im keeping the fave wai in the good let look at this shows your am and he had sal god my i just realized look at my formatting on that disgraceful the ocd is kicking in ive jsky salers aligned to the right as is mine and your holland im should have corrected that never mind ignore that past cant see it lots of salah captains which surprises me i didnt realize that most of that way and three hars and i because it was harland who make w guess for most of these teams when i checked through teams as i do when deadline passes i look and see what other people have done a lot of people made the harland out to sell a move which paid off in the short term but its a big its a big commitment how do you feel about that now because youre looking at this youre probably one of the few managers along with myself who probably still got him i thought about it i thought about doing harland out for sou harland i think it was harland and as well as the salanki to himz move it was going to be harland and because ive got dibling to salah and himz i think it was i was determined to get himz one way or the other and glad i didnt but i think it i would have i would have about broken even on it because although salah would have come in and got the goals i would have benched rogers who scored so and then with the hit i dont think there was a huge amount in in not doing it i thought about doing it this week again not for himz this time but for kuna but as a spoiler im im not doing that so im going to be going another week without salah in my team but i i expected it to be more split i expected there to be more i know this isnt just all the people that have sold sal im sure theres people here who have got salah and harland as well but when i was doing my check of all the managers around us did you do that as well believe absolutely i couldnt i couldnt quite believe how many how many people had sold him do you have an order who do you have an order of whose teams you look at first of course because you do judge like i dont think its a good thing i dont think its very healthy but you do judge yourself by what other people have done how theyre doing i know im im pretty sure people like ben krin and general dont do this at all because theyre stronger mentally and think that probably affects them and it and theyre probably right theyre definitely right but i always do that when deadline passes i look at what youve done what andys done what late ris has done what slippers has done what raptor i look at his team theres probably about a dozen managers i look at and you like compare your players to their who go hes got him but ive got him and then hes got him and ive got him that can a little bit a little bit im more interested in what transfers theyve made because i dont watch the deadline streams so its its i dont know what is done and things like that so i always like to have a look but its i dont know how healthy that is to compare yourself confirmation bias of b the kid i think i think a lot of it is if people are making similar moves to you it feels quite good it was interesting though because i looked at all the sellar outs and all the harland outs are in and the sells in and i still just feel that theres not enough in it between seller and harand for me to think that hes 100 the way to go i know ss been like unreal and unbelievable but i still find it crazy the points harlands got over the last two weeks and all we can do is forward tell me about it and i dont know i look i look at i look at brighton i look at spurs and i look at salah with villa and and southampton and i think i dont know i dont know whos going to win out in that a people will say its going to be salah but i dont think its that its that clear cut to me i wouldnt i wouldnt be at allall surprised if har came back race against follow no question theres not a massive gap between them but there is a gap in the money thats fact right so its like what can you do with that difference in funds i think also what is facted is city arent in a as good a place as liverpool so thats fact as well right so thats i think on a level playing field salo and harland is not a lot in it and arguably harand sealing is higher i think it is but at the moment poor in this groove of winning matches and salahs just doing what he always does like cu i ive had periods where i havent owned him and you watch him you think when hes not playing well im going to get away with this and then he goes and gets a penalty or goes and gets a couple of assists at the end or gets a late goal and you think hes come out with a nine 10 point return out of what was a poor performance and harlands capable of doing that as well but normally with harland its like its signposted he doesnt normally sneak of a turn its like within the first 20 minutes and youre like god this is going to go bad exactly where salah could just turn it like thats the difference and thats the player he is its true it feels to me though that once hollands gone i feel like thats him gone i dont see how you can weve all used the wild cards or most of have used the wild cards so if youre selling him for salah and okay theres midfields with salah sacker and palmer which look like unbelievable and im seeing some amazing teams out there without harland but what do what are you going to do if you want harlem back and the answer to that is nothing right because youre not going to move youre not if youre if youre taking the harlem money and youre putting it around your team and youre putting into those three assets in midfield i dont see how theres ever going to be a point in which you say okay i dont want salah anymore i dont want palmer anymore im going to move back to harland so youre youre done with him right thats thats how i see it until the wild card i agree i dont think youre getting him back with three transfers no because you have to spread the funds the only point in getting hland out of your team is to spread the funds and hope that makes the difference and in a world in a landscape where we have got palmer saaka son salah and as we said last week a cast of forwards who are doing their job and getting maximum bonus from one goal spreading the funds should compensate should i would say but its the recency bias again isnt it of weve just come off harlands most miserable run in his premier league career for city one goal in five hes i dont think hes done that before if the under if the underlyings were like the same as they had been against newcastle and wolves id be in a very different place and again maybe this is where stats we focus too much on stats so maybe he just isnt a poor era of confidence and hes not going to score but hes getting hes getting so many chances still im h im happy im happy to keep him and see him battle out against the seller the seller owners but theyre both great picks those of good comments coming in that isnt one of them l because hes agreeing with you thanks i love this later on though this is this is from flimy joy bassel bank great name this is like go back to the scout cast hes put a rough with the smoth in look rough b in salah but after too much drinking i forgot to confirm my squad so he sat my my god no sat on the bench the move for fimy was rogers started in place that is a smoth same points same point exactly it is did did he captain well he probably captain somebody else but some lovely stuff coming in and swat saying dont forget to like a lot of people agreeing with you triggers in the chat saying he thinks its easy to buy harand back it is its two transfers i think its a mental thing though is its that its that mental block in terms of youve done the effort to get harland out youve spread the funds and then to almost go back to him feels like youre turning a sea tanker isnt its like i dont i dont agree i dont think back because i think if you if the easiest way to buying back would be to sell salah and i dont see when youre going to sell salah even if he blanked in the next three games which he wont but even if he did it still be like its still seller playing for liverpool hed have to go completely off the rails in the next five or six so to get harand you have to sell one of sacka or palmer youre not going to sell one of sakur or palmer with the run theyve got cuz the fixures are unbelievable youre not going to sell palmer before like home game against wolves or whoever theyre playing are you look sacker before west ham its this is the going to happen were going back to the ticker and the two teams top now this is the blackbox ratings by the way not the default ratings on scout scouts ratings are great but i like to tweak it a bit make forest a bit more difficult lets face it that is a harder game than scout right theyre not bright red theyre a bit less blue but chelsea and arsenal are top of the ticket over the next 12 chelsea got ar they got each other this week but after that they both got a fantastic run of fixtures and city ar far down the ticker but its the next three for city plus if you look at this run for city weve said it before brighton away spurs liverpool forest palace united villa out of that run of eight fixtures seven fixtures right the only game that i would say is straightforward unless i dont think united will be now because amarin the new manager first derby its got to be more difficult for city youd think the only fixure there i would say that city will win maybe easily is palace away but cellers parkss a difficult place to go and by the time by the time they get there in game week 15 glasa might have sorted them out and made them hard to beat at home so i look at that and just i dont think theres an easy game there forest at home would be in a couple of seasons go but i dont think it will be for i look at i watched city last night against sportting i thought if we played for city tomorrow i re and forest have a good chance because we are incredibly hard to break down and incredibly good on the counterattack and i watched city and thought they havent got many ideas at the moment they needed de bry are on the pitch because they just quite predictable they are predict and theyre light in midfield like the team you can play it you can play out against them pretty easily and cut through the defense thats like kovic in that holding role just doesnt work for me and lewis or walker at right back theyre all good players theyre all good players and theyre all capable of a bit of magic on the but i would think looking at this brighton are going to fancy it spurs are going to fancy it liverpool are definitely going to fancy it and unless de bru is fully fit and harlands firing again i think forest will go to the ead with the best chance of getting something theyve had since theyve come up no question no question at all so i dont think an easy game there for them im im im giving haren the next two brighton and spurs i think i probably will sell him ahead of liverpool away because i could move him down to salah whos whos hes got the home game or over to sacka whos got west ham which i like ar arsenal havt exactly been great arsenal last night were pretty dire they had a lot of the ball but again it was predictable there a lot of crosses to a center forward who doesnt exist j jezus came on and couldnt generate much from that sacka was double teamed all the time and was frustrated and couldnt martin n is not offering enough down that side and od guards not there odard cominging back well talk about it late is huge absolutely huge and so weve got odard and de coming back into these two teams it could make the world a difference lets look at some data though lets start because were probably going to run on to three hours otherwise but good chat good chat so far lovely comments as well coming in so its good defense for the season a few things i want to mention here and its not forest villa what did you make of the 41 at spurs when defensive dat theyre four feir 099 xg conceded non penalty per 90 and they were second i think on this table going into the spurs game theyve slipped down now its crazy isnt it i dont know whats going on with villa they seem both frustrating as a defensive unit even though the data is good and a little bit limited in attack i look at watkins and hes only had more than two shots in one game all season wow thats a hell of a stat that is i had a look in most games hes getting one or two shots but hes only had three in one fixture so far and he needs the watkins of old needs volume like hes a better player now and hes better at taking his chances but my preconception of watkins before last season was where hes going to need five or six chances to score i dont know if hes a striker who with if he only had two shots in the game could get the numbers he got last season what do you think about that when i watch villa i think when theyre on song and its and its clicking between biley rogers duran watkins theyve got like ramsey coming on t theyve got players who when they link up and play well it looks vibrant and its attacking football and quick like transitions across the pitch looks good but theres been quite there been a couple of games now where you watch them and it just looks a bit laborious it looks a bit slow and that was happening against spurs and then when villa scored from the set piece i thought well thats thats it now like this is happened to spurs so many times they been in complete control conceded the goal and now theyre going to fall apart and they didnt they just they just carried on doing what they were doing before and once they got one it was just a matter of time before villa crumbled because they werent offering no anything when wers went off they were like just limp i dont know what hes so key hes so key to them morgan rogers its unbelievable didnt didnt see that i thought hed be a good pick for us at 5m but i didnt think hed be like the talis almost the talisman of the team after 10 weeks dont know whats missing i dont know what it maybe its lewis has left and he was a big figure last season anal has come in and hes perhaps not as mobile hes not as dynamic with the ball and theyve missed lewiss set pieces because that was a big factor he was he was a master of those wasnt he mcin seems less of influence biley definitely is the fullbacks definitely are as well rogers and watkins have looked okay but theyve looked like their partnership is absolutely key if thats not on song theyre struggling its its weird theres a lot of teams in that bracket i would say is when they sold dougas louise i thought this might be the problem theyd have because he was that eight role who box the box just linked everything so well they signed anana and i thought okay anas more defensive at least he has been a everton and then when he signed he started getting them the goals in the first couple of weeks i was thinking they want something here theyve made a like for like placement with a player that i didnt expect but i do wonder if now they just they just seem to be missing that energy like in the midfield between the defense and the attack which louise gave him so well and that ability with him to pass the ball he his passing was unreal last season he could pick a ball out from from right across the havent got anyone thats looking up and trying to put a ball over the top so much like watkins isnt getting as many i thought villa against spurs watkins would be thr on goal like over and over and over again without there but it just didnt seem to happen and spurs played well i thought drasin played well in that game but i didnt feel like they tested them that often by trying to put those balls over the top and trying to get watkins involved and i was surprised at that cu i thought that was probably their best their best weapon matt saying its all about fixtures it is but lets have a look at their fixtures if you look at the short term theyre theyre pretty bad liverpool away palace at home chelsea away its all about the home games palace brenford sampton youd think that they would im certainly brenford and sampton and youre gna youre going to hold rogers probably for those two but the away games are tough for them so its theyre one of those teams that have got fixtures that are on off on off on off theres no sustained spell other than those two bren that brenford santon over a longer period theyre right down there like over the 12 theyre third from bottom so it i also think as well lo losing to club bruge was that tyro mings picking the ball up and giving a penalty thats a bad result for them because they were flying through that and coasting and now that palace game looks good the one sandwiched in between chelsea and liverpool but then theyve got juventus after that palace game so youve got to think watkins isnt going to see 90 minutes in that game they might even take rogers off early in that they play brenford and southampton back to back but after southampton which is arguably the best game you can have this season they then go away to red bull leig and juventus will be an interesting game because if they lose that game to juventus and then theyve got to go away to red bull li theres suddenly going to be a lot of pressure on them to get a result in that match so again we talked about jackson before and how hes starting every game and watkins and the duran threat but there could be more rotation coming i think particularly over this period because of though the import if theyd beaten club brouge i think that it might have eased it a little bit but losing one nil was wasnt a game i dont think they could afford to lose its 8 nil chelsea at the moment 8 n my god first team out i know the other thing i want to say about villa is jan right and when rogers went off it was interesting never talk of an injury but he didnt want to go off and emory said interestingly i dont think the injury is too bad because he didnt want to come off but i wanted to get i wanted to get two forwards on ive got thoughts on it does make me wonder that because jan is there and hes like on a leash and hes proving himself and he wants to get starts as soon as theres an opportunity to get him on the pitch emorys is like ill take that because in the back of his mind hes thinking if as soon as theres a window where i should consider putting jan on im going to take it so as soon as rogers got a knock but hes off get emory get jan on and itll be the same for watkins as well like so that is a thing when youre take when if youre owning watkins and rogers if they get with 20 minutes to go there is no question theyre coming off because hes looking for a chance to get duran in on the pitch to keep him appeased now maybe thats speculative but thats how it seemed to me in that game because i dont think i think rogers could have stayed on and they might have done better my thoughts on morgan roggers in that game and im a big morgan rogers fan dont get me wrong because i takes of a pinch of salt but dont complain about getting subbed off if youre going to spend 5 minutes rolling around on the floor okay crying in pain and then your manager subs you off and you go what are you doing im fine dont roll around then just get up get on with it if youre fine get up you think hed know you think you think watkins and rogers go on thinking durans gonna come on with 15 20 minutes to go so let me let me make sure i dont give em a chance ive never ive never ive never seen like it cuz like so when son got subbed he was he looked good he was running around and he was like what are you doing r just got subbed and did the same reaction youve been rolling on the floor for 5 minutes man lets move on city slipped down here chances per 976 which is extraordinary clean sheet slow as we said we talked about lewis andard already united the big chances is the highest though so when they are getting a chance its 23 big chances conceded per 90 palace have got three theyre city are certainly the biggest in the top 10 arent they other than bournemouth so they are conceding the wider big open chances yes and arsenal have slipped down and suddenly liverpool and forest are the two best defenses 81 089 dont laugh united what you make united because with the new manager amarin coming in the talk is all about bruno and well talk about bruno in a bit any anything making you think maybe we should reconsider the defense cuz its its 14th here so this would cons this would say no but theyve had the most clean sheets have they this season theyve done second most one at one point theyd had the most i dont thats thats continued but i think i think it might beings must bep four clean sheets liverpool got five liverpool got six i believe for they were at one point they the most but now its now its okay now theyre third but still its its not bad i am getting swept up in the amarim hype you are already are you i am i cant help it you watch that performance that they put in against city and you see the way hes got them playing and if you watch monday night football as well you saw some of the stats that hes bought into to sporting this is the bias i was talking about with some if you watch too much of this you get youre going to end up buying gar you got it too late that was before as well youre so vulnerable i know but like top for progressive carries top for bl shots top for xg top for goals all the things and okay its what cara described as a league enough just a bit but and man utd arent arent one of the top teams in the league so its going to be a difference but i think it is exciting i think ive been watching a lot of like tactics videos about him were going to do a bit on am him in a bit but its its going to be to see whether he comes in and tries to stamp the the three the back formation the wing backs the three rotating sing side forwards all play or whether he keeps going with what ruds rud then t been doing so i dont i think you if youre going to if youre going to buy into it you have to buy into it now because of the next three pictures its got to be the attack lad rather than the defense i would have thought well look at well look at it in a bit its interesting because you said about when you watch tactics thing i think it does affect you before the season started i did a lot of work on moresco and slot and i looked into slots tactics if you remember i showed formations on here didnt i and i thought out of that i thought this is could have influenced me and it did cuz what i did well there was two things i could have done i could have gone diaz cuz i was convinced that one of the wingers was going to be more inverted than the other and i thought it would be diaz with salah staying wide and that is what weve seen so i could have gone diaz that would have worked out well i didnt go df did i went bloody quono instead you got it right for 45 minutes i got it right for 4 cuz i went ill go qu cuz hes going to play and hes a four million defender and hes definitely going to prefer the ball playing defender cuz thats how slot likes to play so rather than take the diaz lesson which would have been marvelous cuz he got like five goals in the first three or four game weeks i went for bloody quono which last his 45 minutes im so gutted i know you it does affect you doesnt it when youve when you think youre on to summit i go im gonna go for that so you got to be careful gotta be careful but you were you were right to go for it you just went for the wrong one of the of the of the two options you call liverpool being a a good team but a more functional team a less chaotic al then again coming from klopp it was always going to be a slightly less chaotic team but i dont think i can claim that saying liverpool a good team is that much of a grand move i but i think i was expecting more of a more of a drop off from them than weve seen i thought it was a big job to replace such a legend in club and i thought there might be a bit of adjustment period or a bit of time to take but theyve been absolutely unreal outstanding top of the defense not top of attack because spurs at top of the attack and i dont think that is surprising given what we saw against villa and it is the basis on which ive gone fre spurs hoping that would get returns its surprised that he chelsea up there but then they banged in eight tonight and that explains why palmer from game rout 12 is such a priority what is surprising is arsenal i think theyre not the best defense now thats been carrying them theyre like four in the defensive data based on xg on penalty conceded theyre down in six here 158 behind united liverpool chelsea city and spurs but od guards back and that could unlock them right i hope that does i hope the handbreak comes off a bit and hav herz and sacka become im not scared of havs and sacka at the moment for me though thats that the difference is odard i just i just think there completely different team to judge when theyve got him in the side and when they havent cuz when you look at the front three when you look at the midfield three of what marino rice and well part has been playing at right back for a bit hasnt he played midfield last night its been hav havit have been dropping in isnt he to the eight and its just theres just no theres no creativity there is theres nothing theres no one that can unlock defenses in that midfield three they and martinelli dont bring enough to the party do they they and theyve both been poor theyve both been poor this season they were last jayus if i was if i was playing against arsenal and i saw martinelli trossard and gabriel jayus in the side i wouldnt be filled with fear like theyre good theyre good players but theyre not league winning theyre squad players in my opinion and then you look at that midfield fre and you think well who in that midfield rice is going to run around and do a great job and hes got a lot of talent dont get me wrong 80m pound player he runs around a bit but hes not whos whos going to be the person to play that killer ball through and if they do play the killer ball through whos whos getting on the end of it i dont they ring theyre relying so much on sacka and you can hes not easy to shut down lets face it hes getting harder by the season to shut down but you can they did a good job on him last night and it showed how you could restrict them when you do that and theyre desperate to get odard back theres no question and i think i would then expect them to climb this table and weve said if you look at the long ticker theyre right up there for the fixtures and from game 12 onwards or maybe 13 west ham away thats where you got to get on them i think again theres a brilliant comment in the chat if you could if you could flag out from no weak foot just saying they need smith row that what that is that is exactly who they need well he would have played wouldnt he would have played i think he would have played i think i think hed be starting i think hed be starting the matches that odard was out if they had him in because they havent got another player that can drive with the ball like he does and play a ball through to some of these forwards and wingers i think theyre it doesnt surprise me at all to see arsenal sick on this list because i just i think theyre quite i think theyre quite ordinary at the moment but we expect them to pick up and we expect them to climb his table again and threaten united attack is up there we talked about the defense does the presence of them fing this table 160 before amarin gets there does that make you even more tempted to go all in well the issue the issue the issue isnt so much the stat this year is the lack of goal i think theyre 18th for goals lack of goals this season or like that and again you look at the team and think where the goals going to come from because holand isnt i dont think hollands a 20 25 goal a season striker rashford hasnt been on it for ages garnacho is wasteful you could argue amad deserves to start but hes i think hes got a couple tonight but id be probably more surprised than not if he if he started the weekend so where the goals coming from are the goals going to come from fernandez is he going to l step up well he hasnt scored more than 10 goals in his last three years is he maybe im completely wrong with that but definitely id be surprised if hes i can tell getting more than that you go there you go you go thats go bang on bang on 10 goals in bang on 10 goals thats his premier league career so his best season 32 returns 2021 when we were talking about him being the new king of fbl even over salo at that point god its not great is it and its been its been deed since 19 goal returns last season though 34 of the goal involvement hes on 33 goal involvement this season because united have been so poor at scoring goals hes only had three returns but that three returns is enough to get him a third of the my god it just shows you doesnt it how theyve struggled because theyve only scored theyve only scored nine goals and which i think its southampton has scored fewer so amarin has got a bit of a bl canvas but hes got a lot to do isnt he and brunos got to be the player that lets have a look at lets have a look at uniteds cast here zi we can we can count out on the grounds that hes put on some timber apparently acc report apparently hes hes a stone heavier than he should be according to v tenar when he left your man gun atos up there in terms of points per xg i non penalty per 52 just ahead of bruno and gacher is the more palatable if youre going to go anywhere because its 63 compared to 82 for me though its about losing a midfield slot to united player im not sure im ready for that im okay im okay with v next three this is the thing because there is no better fixtures than lester rip switch and everton if you were to pick three fixtures it would be those two maybe west ham would be one of them but definitely or south hampton if you had all three pr teams in a row in terms of in terms of a three i think thats thats excellent the question is if amam comes in doesnt matter what tactics he brings in doesnt matter what formation he changes what players he brings off the bench or whatever there isnt players in the team who can score goals hes got to change that mentality and hes got to get them scoring and i look at that cast that youve got on there and whos going to fly in that who is who is going to be the one that steps up and starts banging in the goals theres a lot on brunos got to get 10 goals again if you go back at these numbers he got 10 goals last season 10 in 2122 hes got to hit double figures again hasnt he because i dont i think youre absolutely right you look at this and think im not sure gacho can holand might be able to if he trans to me hs the one though holand is the one that needs to step up because hes the only nine in that team xery isnt isnt good enough this season i dont think hes going to need time hes more of a link player isnt hes not hes not an out his reputation isnt that of a goal scorer necessarily they cant s rashford up front because that doesnt work they tried that they tried that every year and it doesnt work so do try it every year its only highlands there that can do it so he needs to start scoring more regularly has to i me hes got it in him but i just think hes still one maybe even two seasons away from his peak well he is need to st need to stay fit need to have a prolong period without in injury but i think its youre right i think its its not just tactics and formation its mentality if you look at we look at this amarins going to turn up and we think hes going to favor a 3421 and these both these images are both courtesy of skys recent article by the way which ive in danger of being biased by reading that but im not im not going to go all in on united as might be open to persuasion but i dont know how quickly hes going to move to this whether hell land and go right three at the back wing backs will he will he do that do you think or will it take time cuz i was looking at like predicted lineups for manest united if they if they switch this formation and they have three good center backs for this formation in yoro martinez and delit well yoro isnt fit and hes 18 years old so i dont see how he can play delict and maguire in a back three the teams are going to eat that up for breakfast ar thats martinez carrying a lot then in that so i dont think he can go to a back three if its until yos yos back theyve got ma do for the wing back slots and sure if hes if hes ever fit they could also play gono at left wing back i was going to ask whether you think hes going to end up at wing back he could do is interesting because he tends to be the right wing back thats the more attacking one and thats thats what the graphic thats what the graphic shows here sporting average positions under ammer in its its right hand side thats where is the more attacking side so thats dow thats got to be thats got to be dow i would have thought mazra is a good player but if youre and it could be fernandez if youre going to bring in the most attacking for wing back is its going to be dow on that side i dont know if gacho is totally suited for a left wing back role is unless youre just telling him to stay past the halfway line his work rate isnt no isnt the best is it well if hes going to end up there teams are going to target that arent they teams i would i would no question my cameras gone off no question at all that they would target that but i its its the right side midfield behind the forward which will be holand which is interested thats where we think bruno is going to play right it has to be it has to it has to be bruno because the two center mids have got to do so much running and youve got to think thats going to be mayo and agat right because that is thats what they do thats like the roll in the so they seem perfect for this system in the midfield and bruno seems perfect in one of those inside forward spots i think when united have got like a fully fit team i think it works because youve got martinez deck and and yoro youve got shaw on the left youve got dallow on the right ugat and casir is just out isnt he ugat and and mayu and then youve got fernandez rashford and hland that works but if you take a couple of those players out through injury or whatever suddenly i dont think the system they havent got the squad to i dont know to keep to keep the momentum or to make changes i dont i just dont see how he how he brings this in straight away and implements it he needs players i think he needs time and i dont think he goes to this straight away you have no sound mark what have you done i was so well sorry i was interrupting you anyway i muted to get my camera back on he needs a transfer window doesnt he he does i think so i think that hes one or two key players from this formation i dont i dont think hes got enough deb foot win back to play this week in week out he hasnt got that center back like you say thats fit and i dont know if rashford and bruno are going to play behind the striker in those rols bruno definitely can rashford it could it could be amad like a few like a few people are saying but thats a big step up it just feels like to wear pegs to me it does a little bit a little bit considering the pressure hell be under to get results i think hell rethink it and stay with the four at the back initially and then do what he see what he can do in january basic thats way hell go all right lets look at the regular stats of players not too much to talk about as always other than the fact that you take allison out the equation because hes injured on his way back ss is the best keeper now in terms of points per 90 48 which is crazy you ruined him for everyone i blame you entirely i not good enough just didnt see it at all but hes been outstanding four clean sheets but been bring in some saves and bonus as well wanted to talk about onana here cuz he done well with the four clean sheets of mention and that could be if you want to go united im sure united fans are itching to get more players in and nana could be a logical step because he has done well even under tag so youd think there could be an improvement under amarin as well fleen weve already talked about so theres theres not too much movement here other than i think that reyya will come again i think with the fixtures weve seen given where arsenal are on the ticker and from game 13 onwards i dont think forest at home is an easy game but i dont it could be a clean sheet i dont know about you but i do expect to want to move back to two arsenal defenders from about from 12 13 ors are you thinking ive got them ive got two ive still got ry ive got ive got gabrielle its been a rough ride up until now but i look at that run forest west ham man utd fulham everton palace ipswitch brenford 12 right till 19 thats what eight games its easy to say isnt it youd expect three or four clean sheets minimum from those if i was picking a goalkeeper from gw 12 it would be ryer so im happy to im happy to have him i think that when i move harland out some of the money that is cleared will be to try and move back to two arsenal defenders you wont keep i find it hes done all right for me hes got a couple of falls so hes got hes had a couple to be fair he has he has but i dont want to take him beyond like this is with good fixtures as well it was interesting though to watch brenford atam and they said that they spoke to frank before the game and they said would you take a one nil or 43 what you prefer he goes always a 43 and then his team put on the most flaccid performance ive seen for some time right well it was it was ridiculous wasnt it was like were were won that up thats just it cooper it was i couldnt believe i couldnt believe i was watching of all the teams of all the managers to put in performance like that i could not believe it was it was brenford it was ridiculous it was like 45 shots was it to like four it was it ando was just nothing he was more fullback than a winger wasnt he he played down the middle come it was strange so i do wonder whether frank is suddenly going what im tired of the four threes and lets go but because they were once a side that were built on a bit of discipline at the back set pieces when they first came up thats how they build thats thats what you do when you get promoted its what forest did you have to grind out results they became a bit more of a flare team who scored goals this season and played a different style of football which just left them open i do wonder if hes like time to move the dial back but he doesnt want to admit that be interesting but theres no doubt find the middle ground you dont you dont need to be up there or bloody on the bottom find a nice middle ground you got to attack fulham a little bit i dont agree with sexy b saying is rough two world is an injury time i dont think it was rough at all i think it was completely deserved completely deserved that f and won that game they didnt brenford here 15th for the defensive weight data 171 they did have a tough start but theyve had good fixtures recently remind me what their fixtures are like short long term theyre pretty bad now so theyve got these three ever leer then it falls off a cliff right theres no way im taking fle into that one it will be saves gore but villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton ars theyre not theyre not getting anything from thems getting a 50 pointer in one of those games a one nil a one nil against chelsea away wheres the clean sheet coming there villa newcastle chelsea forest but hell do it to sp because thats what thats what these players love to do they love to spite us im even looking in buo and thinking i dont know if i want him over that run no ill be selling hes hes too highly owned i think to keep and thats thats thats pure black box that is too highly owned to keep too highly owned to hes boring isnt he everyones got him you dont even get you dont even celebrate his points when they when they come in villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton arsenal nah we can do better in midfield i think over that certainly be sing the analytics crew will be shouting skill issue at you now i saying that and me for saying it as well hes on pens 90 minute man ever present perfect algorithms absolutely love him regardless of fixtures but i think youre right i think that if youre trying to push up trying to push towards 100k which is what weve got to be aiming for you perhaps have to roll the dice against inmo for that run because its dismal theres no question y the question is where you go but we can cross that bridge when we get to midfield in a minute i dont want to talk too much about tread because we did that last week but simas he is he is now the starter and hes third in this table 026 which theres a whole gaggle of defenders around that 02 bracket trent out on top 036 so above them but only just its not a huge margin and with the it test as weve seen simic talk to me about him 4 six taking set pieces has that more quality than robertson i would say in terms of delivery and in terms of xgi outperformed trent in that game last weekend i think he came out 056 and trent if i remember the walkout video was about 015 dismal like that so simcast definitely can offer us something how close now are you is it week by week were getting closer to letting trent go how close are you sim is on my wall there on side after the after the bench boost last year so a big fan i dont necessarily think hes a step up from robertson i think he is this season because robertson has declined in a lot of areas because hes getting on a bit and fair enough i dont feel like sim is like a new signing whos a great left back necessarily i think hes a squad player who has been thrust into the role because robertson has gone down i wonder if theyre going to move in january for a new left back and man utd are going to be moving for a new left back as well its a very popular england dont even have a left back so its its a its a highly sought after position with not too many options available so be see what they what they do trent like you said i think we need to talk about trent a little bit because again i dont think the run of fixtures liverpool have got lends themselves so well to clean sheets coming forward i think after that southampton game its what everton its newcastle its man city as well and its going to be hard for him to justify 7m unless hes getting more regular returns attacking wise because theres so many defenders who are getting good attacking returns would i move trent to simas not a chance you would not a chance youre just youre just i would go anywhere near simas i just dont think robertson comes in every now and then and plays gomez can play on the left as well cant he could come in for a game i dont think simas is like too far ahead of either of them so avoid for me okay and you im look at liverpools fixtures theyre not great i dont believe theyre okay theyve got that city newcastle 134 which is tough way im looking at this thinking wheres the clean sheets coming from here villa i think they can keep a clean sheet against villa they certainly can against sampton but after that i think the next three or four very tough because theyve got city newcastle everton and spurs they can go a good as some part plenty teams can but its a bit different when its a spicy derby isnt it even calv louis might score in that one but i think i think theres clean sheets there for sure but in a world where those fixtures are tougher the problem with trent is i just i want it to happen i want that game to happen where he just gets those couple of attacking returns and everyone goes ah i do need him i do need him after all well hopefully its going to be one of the next two because its filler and southampton and then its the poor run if were selling harland and were selling trent where the hells all our money going its true kogo you think that min is going to come back in dont you dont think that role on the right side in front of elmans going to be his you think he what moves back to left back at that point then do you im very surprised hes been he started so many on the wing because gruda is there as well whos very highly rated hz said he was excited to work with him but clearly hasnt hasnt done that i wonder if maybe r could move over to the right now we got pedro coming back and oreillys back in the squad too so and ms back in training so i cant see any world in which kyogo carries on a right wing theres too many options that can come in look out for o al by the way hes hes absolute quality i saw you tweet today about well theres a number of players who can play the 10 it wont take long before oreilly gets the 10 and its and its his in my book i think hes well then the question where do pro then where does pedro play its its a problem because i think oreilly is going to be a starter very quickly because i just think hes exactly what you need for me hes so technically good hes a scorer of goals and a creator i think we need a pascal gr we need a pascal in that 10 hes not as consistent as gross so and he has been in a weaker league so lets see how he adjusts theres no question but hes got all the tools so i would have thought that he will end up being your 10 by the end of the season just how quickly he goes in i dont think hes going to be a fantasy asset not yet he could be next season though so c gl said no not much going there well whoa well i dont i dont i dont think he is a no i just think if youre expecting him to start on the wing again youre probably unlikely i still think with brightons fixtures after c i was gonna say even are strong right even if he plays at left back i think hes a good option i think hes starting to adjust to the league now i think hes first choice i think he plays every game i think hes hes the best defender weve got and the best one of the best players in the squad now he was signed of a massive reputation and were starting to see that coming through i would expect some clean sheets over the run of southampton fulham leicester palace west ham so you go you go over you go cadog over dunk or barco would you very good i still think barco could come good at some point but sorry im joking id go id go kogu dunk was dunk was interesting at the start of the season because we thought the set piece threat would be there but hasnt materialized i think kloo is the one hes a bit riskier than dunk but he offers a bit more okay okay i put some chelsea defenders at the end of the table here none of them featur in the top 30 well they dont its not they dont but chelseas fixtures are very strong and were all about parmer from the attack as well we havent touched on sanchez as an option any chelsea defenders tempted you at all i think its interesting reese james coming back what you make of that not going in for reese no hes not he doesnt look the same player at the moment is he hes trying to build fitness up but he looks like it might take him a little while to get going gusto is the one thats maybe more impressive because hes inverting a bit a bit more and getting forward but i wonder if thats going to carry on maybe when james is back to his best he go moves back to right back they got i dont see i think its going to be inversion on the other side its its just whether karella takes gustos minutes away thats the thing and he could because karella is more natural perhaps in that role i just dont theres just not a lot to like is there about the defense they con see goals they theres theres like rotation around those more attacking spots youre not going to go for cwi or for far cuz theres much more attacking options for the same price hard aoid and the thing is as well like we said it didnt we earlier in the show its like there were four fives like davis like eight nori who offer you a bit more in attack and gusto and karella cant even though theyre inverted they cant compete with that they need the clean sheets if chelsea suddenly turn into like a defensive juggernaut then maybe we can consider them but maybe i just i just cant see it fair enough midfield then lets look at that the bos top which for ages has not been worth a mention but hes coming back and it was interesting to see him i dont cant work out what pep was doing last night that night wasnt last night before wasnt it 41 down they go 31 down and n gallagher expert co comor that he is was calling out for he was he was doing cooms did you see that no gallagher no he was doing no he was doing he was doing co coms with dan fletcher and i cant remember who was on with fletch but it was it was no g gone i know so they had they had a shamelessly saying were going to have a fan of one of the teams as a co commentator ive never seen that and he was saying promoting the tour and stuff he probably gave him a lot of money about ive never cuz he kept saying we he kept saying were this and were that great its great isnt it when a when a co commentator is so unbiased but no gallagher was saying this games crying out for kevin he was thats the other thing he was doing hes calling players by their first name because who does that yes as if no gallagher gets to wander into the city dressing room when he likes to have drink well he probably does so fair enough but yes i know what youre getting out there but he was he was saying brennan he was saying this games crying out for kevin at 31 down and he was right i was like well they need a bit of invention maybe kevin can come on see im doing it now he can come on and turn it no he doesnt bring it him on then so we were like thinking well he cant be fit then can he cant if hes not coming on now hes not going to come on he cant be fit hes on the bench to make up the numbers they go 41 down with five minutes of stoppage time to go and pep goes come on kev on you come whats that about hes just come back from injury the games gone theres five minutes left game gone youre right why would you put de boy on i just i know that im not pep none of us are pep and i know hes a genius but even luke i think would struggle to work out what pep was thinking there with the game finished and with five minutes to go thats when you go ill tell you what kevs been out for months but they stick him on see how he does in the last five minutes very strange decision but it was it was also strange that he was on the bench for bournemouth and they were 21 down desperate for a goal and they dont bring him on in that game is like whats the point of him even being on the bench in that point of him being on the bench in either of those games youve got to think that its it is a numbers thing rather than name three keepers theyre putting de bruyer on and then if theyre desperate they bring him on and i get it but why bring him on when youre 41 down in a game that theyre not knocked out as a result of losing that game so why try and hes not going to turn it around is he in five minutes the only thing i can think of is hes trying to give de bruyne like a psychological lift that hes been out for a while and now hes gets to come back and feel the grass under his feet and hear the crowd and all thats but that is clutching thats all ive got imagine someone gone through him and hes out for the season just because of that five surely you i dont know who am i to question pep but i thought it was odd well he done it before with de bry didnt he de bry was out for the whole preseason and then he chucked him into that first game was it last year or maybe the year before and then he was out for like four months and then pep was like i probably shouldnt have played him in that game he wasnt ready whyd you do it then anyway what you make of that impact on thoden we expect it to help harland because deyne is elite when it comes to creating chances theres no theres no one in the league like him thats why hes top of his table do you i cant see foden operating out wide and bernardo silva starts so surely de brer back means fod and becomes more of a question mark right is a strange one because i cant see a world where foden gets a prolonged period of time out of the team because of do you not his quality well no because hes hes just hes just one player of the season and he in the games ive seen even the last few hes hes hes hes hes hes been very influential in the last couple of games i know they havent won but he scored the goal against sporting he had a good game i thought against bournemouth created loads of opportunities in that created like what four big chances in the game against southampton as well the issue is like you say is where you playing because theyve got savio on the right who i think is excellent foden we know from last year worked best with walker bobbing past him so he could tuck into the middle not going to get that so much with lewis so does he play in its him and de bruyne in midfield but then they havent got the wheres berard going then but the trouble is they havent got the they havent got the cover cuz its all right to do that when youve got rod doing the work all the dirty work behind you they have to play gundan and cover have to play dont they i dont think i dont think gans been good at all since hes come back from barcelona so i think theyve got a real its obvious to say theyre missing rodri but when the replacements arent stepping up its a big problem and youre right i bernardo would move over to the left but then theyve got nunes there as well havent they i dont know i think it is a problem for foden ive got ive got one more week with him i think he against brighton hes got a good record against us as well but then i think he is an issue but i dont see how he can not play him but then i dont see how he can play consistently i think de bruy just doesnt play every game i know i think i think if youre gna play de brer its going to be in europe and its going to be the tougher teams its going to be the games that you wont fow them in the easier fixures i think were still going to get that but its going to be interesting mojo saying i dont hes trying to give him some minutes and a done game whats weird about that cuz it was a stoppage time it was the injury time he brought him on for 5 minutes isnt going to benefit ala did it with oard last night as well didnt he gave him like two or but the game wasnt out of reach it was 41 so its like with odard coming on you think well he might do something to get them a point still late though i dont know why you they were one goal behind so i could sign of see the logic of it like he might 10 minutes though but i still thought it was even though i agree the de one the de one the de bruyne one is weird i think it will when de bruyer is playing i think it will have an impact on ph i think it probably means he goes out to the right still but we think hes less effective there with without walk cup so indeed diaz and salah diaz with a hattrick i said in my walkout video that it was only salah and then diaz goes and get the hatrick to shut me up what you think its going to happen this is this is its going to be like this all season jot comes back scores a brace diaz gets a goal gakpo suddenly is the best its im just not going near it youre i cant be i cant be dealing with it i do think though di diaz should be playing through the middle over darwin do you i like thats that gakpo diaz salah is that is a potent front could that be a thing i think so cuz so i think darwins been all right but i still dont think hes got a longterm future so in a world where diaz starts looking like he could play centrally well then that then i think that change when js back though youve still got that question mark around diaz and j but if js out for a while and diaz is playing through the middle then but 100 you said tonight you were in a sleeper call and you said that dan fbl mate offered us bowden for diaz he feels diaz end up being down the middle that isnt quite that isnt quite what happened i tried to pressure him into selling phone for diaz what are you doing without my permission we assistant manager you we comanagers what you well i thought once it once we got the offer then we could talk about it was i had to i had to give it the big the big talk at the time to try and get the off from the table youre just trying to get your own back for the fact that i turned down himz for intia i kept intia now hes injured and i missed out on all that did you turn it down turned it down i thought we missed it i was saying today i thought we miss turn it down also threw an insult sal as way and think do you think were stupid you might be able to catch us back from the pub i was i was always after that anyway that would have been a great move thanks eddie will come good dont worry a couple of years be fine palmer injury just a load of nonsense injury if he if he doesnt play ill eat this hoodie there you go i cant help but think that mesas gone okay alessas playing nonsense with sacka and all this stuff about you not pitched in the training picks and they play arsenal next and palmer is like palmers a player that would if arsenal thought he wasnt playing it could completely change their tactics so you got to think the mesas like well there could be he has hes not trained today and all this he hasnt trained because hes not playing in europe and we know that and he wasnt in any of the picks and all this stuff and its i dont know maybe im wrong for me the martinez challenge the contact was minimal it wasnt a regular challenge i know moresa said that and youre right but to me it didnt look like there was enough contact to make palmer injured out for the weekend but well see i think i think it was quite a quite a nasty knock and it is the thing that i could see being a bit of an impact injury that keeps you out of training for a couple of days but theres absolutely no way theres enough in that to keep you out of chelsea versus arsenal with the way chelsea are playing and at a time when arsenal were beatable at the moment this isnt the arsenal of like the end of last season when theyre winning every game chelsea look at that game and think we can do them over it theres just no way palmer doesnt play that game he just 100 im like 999 reoccurring percent sure he starts hell get patched up and play i dont think chelsea do it but well see when we get to predictions what i think there but i think that palmer plays for sure absolutely its not muscular its a knock thats thats the key thing and he and hes with the england squad as well and he would have they would have pulled him out of that moresa could have used this as an opportunity to pull him out of the england squad and said hes got a bit of a i re its palmer saying dont pull me out of it because im ive got to make a st for tel im fine see i buy that son will be a target if bren if palmer is out the natural thing would be for those without spurs players going into the it switch game if palmer is known as out you move salah if you can if you havent got him but i would have thought son would be the natural step down if before the break and then you have to go back to palmer after that if you add palmer and he is rolled out would you hold him through the break for 12 given that thats when we need him for that fixture run or would you move him out and spend two transfers what would you do and the other question i did the qa with sam for scout earlier and shes shes on a w so the moment shes got palmer and no son and i said to her why dont you well and she agreed like wouldnt you go for like son move to palmer afterwards because she havent got she hasnt got value tied up in him either shes buying palmer for the first time on the wild card youre booking in a transfer and everything like that i can see why you might not do it but even take taking a one if youre going to take a one week punt on a player son surely is the one that you take the punt on got some minutes in europe tonight home game against ip switch s hes arguably the best captain this week isnt he if you were free hitting youd be very tempted to give him the cabin you because hes got the pens right so thats the edge hes got over salanki and koseski and brennan and that is the pens right no well and johnson i could call him jonno if you like jonno its even worse but im im im i think thats the thats the step down that people will do it is a step down in price and then you have to get palmer back once he year fit i dont think its going to be i think its a nonissue no question though if youre i think youre right on the wild card if youre wild card in this week like sam is you go in you go all in on spurs dont you and then exit out game week 12 surely you go porro salanki and son dont you if you wild i think so unless youre taking palmer out and losing like triggers put in the in the chat if youre losing like 3 2 3 then i dont think you do but if you havent owned palmer like some idiots you and i up until up until now i think i think you definitely go for go for some go fair enough lets take on forwards then not too much to talk about that i want to talk about j pedro though hes not high in his table because he hasnt been about hes 23rd 35 x on ped per 90 coming back though with those good fixtures and he then enters the conversation that has been dominated by the likes of himz wood kuna recently i would say cal le but i dont want to keep mentioning him where do you stand on jia pedro do you like i know the algorithm is absolutely love him and theyre throwing him at me going hes on pedal is hes gonna they love him the models love jaia pedro so hes hes going to find his way back into teams isnt he well hell find his way back into teams but will he find his way back into the team thats the thats the big question thats what im asking you as the brighton f as the expert very brave asking me to predict brighton i feel like ive completely lost my what im im not even going to try and predict what the what the 11s going to be but what i will say is that weve got some good strikers for the first time in quite a few seasons who were playing 90 minutes weve got chriswood weve got kuna you could we got salanki you got nicholas jackson with good fixtures youve got vissa you might be keeping harland these are all you got welbeck whos playing like every minute as well havs with great arsenal fix you got so many good fix so many good players do you want to bring in a player who if he starts and he plays for brighton will score points because hes a great player and hes got penalties but he has such an unbelievable amount of competition that none of those other players have in his position i do think herz loves him though does hes hes said things to give us indication that hes he sees him as the man the player who can turn a game so absolutely but youve got rutter playing in the 10 at the moment whos been exceptional for about five or six weeks now so i dont think i dont think joe i think i think hes been i think hes been more than all right i think hes been brilliant i think hes been an excellent player and hes our record signing as well i think its very harsh if pedros fit and comes straight back in and replaces russer i think p i still think pedros ive said this all season im probably gonna be completely wrong i still think pedros best chance of getting into the team is as a nine and taking the place of welbeck can taking the place of wont do it wont happen it will it will not happen this side of christmas theres no way so hes either taking mats place on the left or hes taking the 10 weve got oreilly back like weve mentioned weve got r who i think has been playing well you got three players for one position why would you go there when youve got other strikers who are first choice talking of other options i havent mentioned either hazards or isac but theyre theyre edging havit with the fixtures hes edging back into the picture isach with a little bit of form how close what would they have to do to get you looking their way esack is someone i want i hes the fixtures are good look right the fixtures are good and hes hes one of those one of those strikers on penalties talisman of the team and i just think newcastle was just starting to turn a little bit of a corner with the way theyre playing football now theyve got a system thats working for they always look a bit more on it great win against arsenal to give him a bit of confidence as well and that west ham game in 12 i know thats the thing is it cuz 12 is the pivot thats where we all probably have two or three transfers and we go harland out palmer in and then its like who comes in for harland and theres jackson in the equation theres kuna maybe would but the fixtures are turning isaks got havitz will be in that picture because all right forest isnt easy but after that its west ham united fulham everton palace hit which good run but isaks going to be in that in that in a weeks time or after the international break when were sitting here doing this show then were going to be talking about where we go and isach and havit are going to be on the menu arent they well look at the start of the season we thought isap was going to be in our teams all year there wasnt there wasnt any well there was there was a couple but use the cal expression there was very few managers who went without ea game week one and okay it was a great fixture against southampton at home but the general consensus was hes going to kick on this year and do well and its its been a combination of newcast not playing well the injury hes had but i love that talisman forward for a side and he plays west ham leicester and ipswitch in six games as well with brenford thrown in and palace who he should get chances against too i like it if youre selling harland in 12 or 13 i think eack is one of the best pi its just a differential that itll be and i can say west ham are probably the worst premier league side ive seen at the city ground in my time since weve been up i thought that was it was they were so bad i know they were down to 10 men but it wasnt wasnt a lack of theyve got good players dont get me wrong but just in terms of the way they were looking around the pitch completely lost no direction no identity it was so archetype a team that didnt believe in what they were being told to do or anything they were doing it was so obvious from just watching the game and forest were just like well this is dick this is just were playing around them and theyre not there was just no teamwork no spirit everything you dont associate with west ham they are gone unless they get rid of ly and all the talk is ive watched a lot of le i watched a lot of west ham stuff after the match because i like to see what they say and they were talking a lot about their own situation as youd expect and they were saying that they dont think sullivan will get opy out because of the nature of the how they got him was relationship with the agent and so on and if thats true if sullivan does drag his feet getting ly out because i have no doubt its not going to work i dont see him turning it round west ham have got to be put in the bracket that weve put the likes of itswitch and southampton in terms of thats a fixture we need to target no question could score two or three goals in that game well absolutely and you look at you look at some of the other teams you look at everton and theyve had spells this season where theyve looked all right theyre still a team that you wouldnt fancy any given week but theyve got players in the team who can like harrison like oneal like mcneil sorry like im not even gna say cal lin but betto up top theyve got players in there who can who can under dice you always feel like theyve got a system i think southampton been better last few games theyve been playing quite well big win against everton and played pretty decently against man city and spells too you look at ip switch i think theyve got something about them good manager everyones fighting for the cause i look at all the teams and i think theres positives i look at west ham and i struggle to find the positives in that side i look right through the team and think wheres the wheres the quality there is quality there kudos is out for another two games thats a blow bowen is an exceptional player its and p bowen and petta petas gone though hes hes gone honestly not hes offering nothing to that team but this is the problem right theyve got qu if you if you look at west hams three best players its bowen petta and kudos peta when hes committed but hes not now hes not but same its the same with kudos kudus is the same kudus is an unbelievably like talented player but i dont i wouldnt rely on him every week to put in a eight or nine out of 10 hes hes got an attitude hes got an attitude may be but i think ls got something to do with that lki took him off at halftime at brenford what was that i dont know what was going on so maybe there is off the pitch stuff im just saying west ham is a far easier game at the moment than perhaps people think based on i think w i think west ham at home if i was picking a player in a game i would want west ham at home at the moment for my player spirit wise there its not its gone theyre gone theyre gone they its such a shame its like because i want theyve got good players who could be useful to us but i thats why isak could be a real big differential game week 12 for sure no question at all thought we do predictions lets talk about our sponsors as yes so it is sleeper of course we mentioned them already the sleeper draft were playing fpl mate whos top of the league in that in our in our next game if youre watching or listening to this you cant get involved in that but what you can get involved in is the blackbox pick them game which you probably heard us talk about already essentially if you zap the qr code thats on your screen if you watch this on desktop or theres a link in the description it will take you to sleep app download it completely free enter into the blackbox pickham league and all youve got to do is pick the outcomes of all the games in the premier league and the person at the end of the month who has

but yes get involved i know were just were sle bags but get involved and like i said completely free to play youre supporting the stream if you get involved and hopefully you can win a great prize too so zap the qr code or use the link in the description oe sack i dont know if youre a west ham fan no quality have great players play absolutely i agree i think i think petta is not the player he was hes unquestionably an absolute quality player kud also i think amazing player bowen an amazing player they have got antonio is not what he was so theyre struggling up front and i dont think bowman can play there i totally agree theyre just not playing for the manager i dont i dont think i dont think theyve got a great team they got fabianski in goal with emerson starting juan basaka i dont thinks good enough for a for a the decent side hes not good enough if youre playing three at the back hes good enough if youre playing four at the back but hes playing three at the back and hes asking him to contribute up the field which he cant do as we know so wouldnt take any of them a brion all right maybe bow was i was shocked by how poor they were cuz i know theyre much better than that when i saw them anyway its getting harder to get this screenshot as this is the lead of order predictions but every week i seem to have to scroll down to find you i dont know whats going on so the tables getting small its getting smaller font every week as i try and make it long fing 54 im on now im see ive almost caught hot iron in terms of correct outcome percentage now hes on hes come down to 55 so fair enough youre fresh me on outcomes and score youre doing well this i think this is this has got to be the first time ive been below 50 because 50 is always our target isnt it if youre doing if youre at 50 youre doing all right and ive dropped below the magic 50 mark so i need to i need to get back on it you do indeed hard season to predict it is over 1100 watching weve only got 200 likes what would you say that was you say that was ridiculous as or what would you say that was i would say its ridiculous this and im saying if youre watching this and you havent and you havent liked the stream youre a ridiculous person so please do especially if youre a west h fan cuz i love you i just think its a shame im going to see west h brighton with fella over christmas i think its like the 20th of december like that and we got a 50 quid bet on on brighton finishing above west ham this season i think at the start of season i wouldnt have said it but i think i think youre going to get that now but i think west h will turn it around but not unless sullivan gets l out sadly right lets go for our predictions theres no theres no early kickoff saturday i dont like that i dont like no kickoff hate that it means the leaks could be more prominent couldnt it as well which i dont like god ian theres not exactly many there not i just i dont want all that dont want all that again brenford bournemouth defense straight away interesting youve got 21 brenford ive i think brenford are a good team at home and i think bourma for a poor team away from home so i thought this was i thought this was quite a sensible one buar struggling away from home i just dont think brenford defensively are good enough to keep them out and i do wonder whether frank has like i say mve the d a little bit in terms of what hes going to allow them to do in i hope hes learning his lesson and hes going to go back to the fun chaotic brunford of old so youve gone one two one way ive gone two one the other fair enough palace fulham difference of opinion here as well youve gone on the way win one nil fulham ive gone one all want to b i think its quite an even game i just think fmer are a better side than palace at the moment palace have got a lot of injuries with wton and e both outs again not sure when theyre when theyre back or if theyre coming back if theyre both out again then they got big problems so ill back for them winding their sales after their comeback and look at this difference again youve backed west ham youre going 21 west ham over ever ive gone 21 everton i just couldnt back everton i dont know i think i think at home i think this was just this was just done by the home fixture i think if everton had been at home id have gone for an everton win i dont think theres much in it between them but west ham maybe just to just to nick it and buy him a bit of time before the inevitable sacking in a month no question west ham and a better side and they have more quality on the pitch but i just i dont know i just think the fights not there and i think if everton get one up theyll go two up i think west h might pull one back so thats the narrative im going with set pieces i think as well everton will cause them problems because we certainly did they didnt look that secure and set pieces defending them so i think ever will win it probably have a couple of corners michael keane and tarkovski probably like that w s anon we both agree on the outcome youve gone 21 ive gone 31 kuna returns here we havent talked about kuna i just did an article about him on a sports casting where his stats are crazy i didnt realize well i didnt hey how many attacking returns he got last season he got 17 which is incredibly impressive he was averaging 47 points which is the same as bruno fernandez was last year i know i know we sag off bruno a bit still thats an elite player playing for a topish side compared to one playing for a struggling wolf side the chances created most chances created of all forwards i think its like the third most shots of all forwards as well ridiculous like that hes just doing everything you want you forward to be doing hes hes involved with i think hes going to get something out this game we talked about him didnt we last week in terms of his relationship with the bonus is good because of the chance hes created and plus wolves dont keep it clean sheets so score a goal or get any a turn and hes straight in the bonus plus hes on penalties they know hes going to be in that discussion when we do the next episode when were looking at forwards to replace harland which im sure we will be fixtures are still good so but this is the fixture to own him for isnt it i think he comes out of this with potentially double figure return and maybe ain norway gets that clean sheet but well see in man city youve gone 31 man city ive got ive given you a point you just dont fancy it what does chris say what does your dad reckon do what i dont even i dont even think i will stick with this when because we still got time to edit these i think its 31 either way do you hows that for sitting on the fence i worry a little bit that we go for blood against them and we just get like annihilated and caught and foden turns up and harland they score im sure they score no doubt about that its it could its going to be a good game and its talk about garden center game this is not the game you want to miss this weekend but then part of me thinks if we do go out and go for them and we could play them off the park and then if we score a goal early and we get in their heads maybe we do go on and win it fairly comfortably i dont know tricky one ive im going to b the pessimism its the easiest one to do is its your own team so ill back city but i wouldnt be surprised bri w this we got consensus on the 800 kickoff saturday its liverpool villa weve both gone 2 nil routine i think that looks it done it for me villa are just something it wrong the traveling is going to this is their third away game in a row having gone to spurs bru and now anfield that does take it out of you and they just seem flat dont they and i think liverpool had the european game as well but i just dont see them slipping up theyre not slipping up are they liverpool no i cant see anything other than a routine that i think villa will theyve got the potential to cause problems because they have good players but whos going to benefit i think they i think they can put a shackle on roders and i dont think theyll got caught up with balls over the top like maybe they used to do under klopp so watkins might struggle a little bit i think fairly routin united leicester you are all in on united here arent here 30 well theyve scored nine goals all season theyre going to get 30 of that in one game here against a koopa low block seriously and its the first time that that leicester wont score all season against man utd im bought into the amaron hype you are i think i think the players do what there was a lot of criticism about man utd against chelsea i thought they were all right i thought they did all right i think they did enough to win that game with some of the chances they i think chelsea were the better side overall but i think united created more opportunities in that match theyve won again tonight they should be beating leicester comfortably with the players theyve got so im going to back them to do it give rude his send off i enough and this is interesting forest newcastle its the only garden center game i could pick out of this lot because im not going to go chelsea arsenal although i do think in terms of spectacle chelsea arsenal will probably be pretty dull and the predictions weve gone weve backed that up youve gone three2 to forest ive gone one all three2 do what five goals in this you think chris wood hatrick he did it last year at st james he did he did and theres some players with some beef with newcastle weve got weve got chris wood got the hatrick at st jamess part last year we got alango who they were after and we didnt let go to newcastle they came in with 50m right at the death and we said no so alanga would want to play up and see if he can tempt them again in january and weve got aliot anderson who was let go and they didnt want to let him go good hes a fantastic player so weve got weve got three of our most important and influential players with something to play for here but newcastle will turn up with a bit of form i think itll be a very good game in terms of it being a tactical battle i dont know if thered be a lot of goals but you think is im very surprised very surprised youve gone 3 to i think one all is a much more realistic outcome and i think if you do need to get down that garden center this is probably the only game i would i would recommend i am going to this nice im probably going to have the worst journey ever because its ra replacement service those dreaded free words no so i dont know how im going to get home bigger fan than i am i cant i cant not go even if its on telly because of forest are just riding a crest of a wave arent they so ive got to go look at this agreement spurs it which this is not very often we go the same on a score line like this we both gone 40 which makes me think i need to be taking salanki captain more seriously than i am is if you trip triple up on the spurs and the salanki captain tempting isnt it but you just think theres no way here that they dont just fres it which right well realistically they shouldnt theyre a great team at home and weve shown the stats today spurs are the top attacking side in the league it switch to the bottom defensive team in the league so theres absolutely theres nothing to suggest that spurs wont wont win this they are when you watch them and when theyre in full song and sanki has been an unbelievable signing if you take fpl out of the equation what he gives to that team and the way he brings others into the in terms of pressing its no wonder that theyre so h because he presses high he links up the play well brings in the wingers who are effective especially with sbach now theyve got even more of a weapon on the left and i cant see any way up switch have any have anything to be able to deal with them so indeed daniel how the turns have tabled exactly its like only a couple of weeks ago we were like kalanki got to go is he but now i was saying this to sam earlier when johnson scored i sent a like pissy message to yell was like im so stupid i should have gone for johnson over sank im so annoyed with myself and all this and then how quickly things turn around and now we predicting 40 and im going to captain him so fpl is a funny game chelsea arsenal youve gone nil ive gone one nil i think arsenal will just grind this out i think this will be a set piece goal and then they just frustrate chelsea i do think clean sheets are coming back into the arsenal armory again and i think this will be the first one as a nonpma owner were probably both biased and this could be a three all draw with palmer all in but i just dont see it being that match nor do you by a look of it no i think arsenal can contain palmer when he starts and im sure he will its the game isnt it where like he just its the game which the chelsea arsenal and i think i think it said man utd chelsea was like the most nil nils in premier league history like that these bigger games i always go into it with a bit of an expectation that its going to be a bit of a ball fest and arsenal liverpool was the exception because that was two and there was lots of goals in that but i think this is going to be a nil or a one nil eitherway thought you say so matt and fy fimy joyd are both doubting the spurs clean sheet but i refer the honorable gentleman to the attacking data which it switch a 086 xg non penalty per 90 that is incredibly poor so yes theyve got the lap but i think whats the whats the lap in terms of goal involvement have we got that on here we havent but i think his goaling go is something like 70 so you stop dap it which dont score and dap could score for them and that could be a factor but i think the logic behind the spurs clean sheet isnt the robustness of the spurs defense its the powder puffiness of the it switch attack right well the one weapon it switch do have is leaf davis from corner and youre benching im benching him but if theyre going to score if ifs swi score i bet its from a corner from a leaf davis corner well vicario and the spurs defense are all over the shop arent they for those god theyre so bad set pieces they so they saw it from against villa just viaro just doesnt know how to how to claim him hes hes a great keeper otherwise but he struggles in that area okay thats our predictions lets have a look briefly at the captaincy its a tough one isnt it because theres a theres a real spread because were going to have the harland owners were going to have the salah owners and then were going to have those who are going to go off the wall and go maybe a salanki or even an mumo maybe and its lovely to see i sit here now and think theres going to be a real when i when i check peoples teams like i do 1100 or whatever on saturday i will see a spread of captains across all those that i look at i think its this is exactly what we wanted what were going to have we perhaps further on i think so i think i think well see harland i think well see salah do you think itll be majority salah do you i think youll see all salas i think its going to be salah sal it does make me wonder bruno of course mentioned in chat there on matt does make me wonder whether i should go against that and go harland or even salanki because theres no question that those three players could lets have a look at robs graphic because i think that could tell us a bit more rob t at robt fbl do follow because he does some excellent stuff and this is just a sample this is showing the spread betting expected goals and expected clean sheets odds expected goals top of this is spurs to 290 then its united 245 liverpool 235 city are out at 205 so not in the top three in terms of surprised its that way around for liverpool city i thought given its villa and there are top sixish side and the fact that we going to conc h of a lot of chances more than likely i thought that would be the other way around but interesting does that make you think that that cements salah but it also says salan is the tilt right i just i sometimes i just feel that we do these podcasts we look at all these data we look at all these stats we spend however many hours a week looking at stats and drilling down and we have evidence to say that weve got the best attacking team in the league versus the worst defensive team in the league with a player whos just scored 16 points scored again in the europa league tonight clearly okay i dont know clearly now got something about him wind in his sales weve got salah with a fairly trick which could be a fairly tricky i think he still returns but it could be a fairly tricky game for him we got har bang off form im going for sanki i am very tempted because i think youre right its like how often do we have the worst attack against the worst defense with the with the confidence that way the only thing that makes me concerned is you look at the spurs attack and it could come from anywhere it could come from brennan it could come from son it could be kesi it could be madison madison will surely play this game so what i do know is that spurs wont let up it wont it you look at city and liverpool if they go 2n up you wouldnt say theyre going to run up 45 nil if spurs go twonil up it could easily be 4 five because an wont stop hell keep coming ratons injured y so did salanki start tonight i was be very no it came off lank started and got sent off okay so charltons injury for me that made me more interested in sank because i dont see sank getting subbed because who comes on and plays that central role and if anything think sons going to get subbed because hes back from injury johnson might get subbed mickey moore might come on the right hes as well is he right so johnsons probably 90 minutes as well then okay johnsons a fun one hes on this list as at list as well we know ipswitch are weaker down that side isnt the leaf davis side its ben johnson isnt it i think hes been playing for ip switch i wouldnt trust johnson then again i wouldnt trust its a funny one isnt it is brennan against leaf davis is because brennans right side up against the left side okay then i i fav that less then so its well its son up against ben johnson then if i if i if i had son id be very tempted or if i even if i didnt have son i had a route to get him id be very tempted by that the flip side his leaf davus does get forward and so brennan could get behind him i think he beats him for pace brennan i weve both predicted 40 so youve got to think that even if sanki doesnt come out as a top scorer here hes going to get a return son is the player to go for with the penalties as well im im i am now depending on what videos i watch on friday night im gonna go salanki so if i watch if i watch anything on salanki or spurs or ab adct which i probably will go that way if you see a video of do slon with a sausage dog thats going to be it isnt it i know thats all hes got to do thats all hes got to do im so im so open to persuasion on this one thats for sure if not ill just play safe with s but its its lovely to have a tt isnt it because thats a big tilt on your part for four with well lets have a look at our teams for it as ry in goal im envious ray is ray is in goal al its not i hope that nil comes through your one nil prediction but a little bit une easy its raya trent gabrielle and moreno as the defensive four its foden for one more week before i move over to palmer because ive got the money which ill talk about in a sec its inmo its garnacho little bit worried now seeing as amad has come on and scored two goals in the europa league rogers hes got the yellow flag but he played in the champion so hes going to be fine and its harand slanky captain and i did watkins out for kuna you got kuna thats nice thats nice i do like that team i like it i gu rogers g at foden theyre its a its a its a team which has potential to do because if sanki blanks and salah goes off and fens a bit of a gam im playing rogers against trend ive got double arsenal defense if chelsea score i dont know its its a team which i its not ide like im seeing sams wild card team for example im thinking god it looks strong with salah saaka and palmer all in there but then palmer and saaka playing each other i know im im im happy to own kuna though the plan was always to get to get kuna i was going to do harland and dibling out for salah and kuna but then i wouldnt have had the money to get palmer right so you can go palmer in what can you go palmer in one move next so i can do f to palo next week for so youre not going to go s at all no youre going to hold harland and not go salah well harand might be coming in for i might be doing harand to salah in 13 when they play each other but it will be holland over salah for the next two salahs got southampton game at 12 but hollands got spurs at home id expect him to do something in that and im cting palmer anyway against leicester so salo liverpool high press against s an i know there but then if i go for if i go for salah then im not gonna have palmer so theres theres always goingon to be someone that im gonna be id rather have salah at santon than palmer at leicester well i cant afford so i cant afford s in one move so its gonna have to be palmer i do have another free transfer though to use i dont want to play rogers away i am i but what you think so well i was i was thinking of maybe moving for a united defender and bringing in mazari or do maybe even for lewis because if im not playing lewis this game im not playing him against spurs and then im not playing him against liverpool when im when am i going to play him what about 8 nori says fb forest eight nor is fine but theyre not theyre not keeping clean sheets and i dont think hes gonna go i know but i dont think hes going to go on and get 20 attacking returns i could i could i could do lewis to i could do i could do lewis to someone i dont know but i quite like the idea of just saving the transfer cuz theres theres not many clean sheets around anyway rogers could get something against liverpool at least ive got some stake in the game if trent loses clean sheet so as im a little bit tempted by lewis to to mazra or d a little bit a little bit tempted m agre i like that one i dont leicester to score old trafford seems remote to me i just think cooper is going to low block there wont be much ambition i i think del could go on as well but if amam does come in and change the system and del playing wing back i think he could be a strong option so theres a py that wants to do it im im not i dont know im 5050 see how i feel comment of the night nooski as your team is not good i see 40 points perfect cheers nooski is there a prize for comment of the night we should have that if sank gets a couple of goals and foden and foden turns up its not going to be a midlin result this its going to be either absolute disastrous cuz i can see chelsea scoring i can see newcastle scoring i can see villa scoring i strangely i think trent is your best bet for a clean sheet i can see foden getting an hour and dea getting half an hour and foden coming off i can see salanki should be right i can see gacha and rogers blanking kuna should be right you do maybe it is a middling team maybe its not foden harand slanky kuna that theres those four theyre going to with this team this week i tell you what though i think i can catch you this week but it isnt going to be down to fleen fle thats thats your old team so thats a good start thats my is it thats your thats your old team sal against brighton slanky against god it is whats going on here let me i dont in that case and i dont think ive got my team let me try what am i goingon to do now then let me see if i can grab my team youll have to keep talking while i try and do this show cant even show the right i thought i thought i grabbed my team thats odd i dont know how i can do this now can you can you go back to my team then i can just talk through that a bit more sorry about that i thought id got that right but clearly not do what i knew i knew that this team was going to get slated by people this week because its got players in it that not a lot of people have got but ive seen enough from har and foden to think theyre both still good options like i said i think theyre going to were going to concede chances to them if gacho plays hes playing leicester i still think hes a good pick should have got more in that in that game slanky captains fun is a good option rogers is the weakest link in this side this week which is why is tempting to move to a dow or a or a mazari mazra the reason why i keep mentioning mazari by the way is not because i think hes a better option than dow its just the money masro is 45 i think dow is 51 theres a point 6 difference between them and if i am going to be looking to get sacker in the future like that im probably going to need that money the one thing is when it comes to gw 13 and i move harland out i might also be tempted to move trent out as well and thats going to free up a lot of money so that tempts me into just going for do because i think in a few weeks i might have some more money in the bank any i cant grab my team because i forgotten what the screenshot im on a mac and i dont know what the screenshot button is and its too complex to do so were just gonna have to just gonna have to talk through my team im afraid so sorry about this great if youre on the podcast not great if youre on the stream unless anyone knows what the screenshot button is on the on the mac but i dont use the mac often enough to know im sure therell be some this why i hate max always something ridiculous isnt it and then i cant i cant get the bloody bench in either because its too its the wrong format im trying just bear with me and i do this hold on three times and do a forward roll and thatll get you a something weird apple up three everyones saying different things i know ive got it command shift three now i dont know how to get it into the stream let me just see if this works let me just go on i dont know how this happen i love that everyones posting different commands for a screenshot no ones put the same one twice no i cant do it i cant do its no good cant do it right so my team is i just have to talk for it sorry for people on the on the stream its youre going so well mark until you got i know it was going well so my team is just for the podcast and for people listening it is gna be god this is a disaster it is fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis mumo johnson salah ameno harland and salanki so ive benching rogers at the moment do i play lewis or do i play rogers thats the question i think they both get one to two points so i think you probably play the attacker you did it there we go but im dragging it into the wrong screen if anyone would like a little bit of a window into to what its like doing these with mark this is its i cant do its all broken no two minutes later ive done it ive this is you every week every week its blurry though its not good quality but its the best i could do so fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis in johnson salah captain seeno maren salanki do i play rogers over lewis and do i captain salanki are the two questions im not going to make a transfer because i need to save the two for gw 12 with the palmer question in mind i am i think i think you i think you play rogers i think you play the its its its 5050 between i think you go you go for the city can seeed again dont they thats the thing its its just i dont back villa to score either so its not like no but whats more likely villa score or city dont concede i dont know thats close liverpool are the best defensive side and i dont think vill in great shape and not only a villa got a score but rogers has got to have something to do with it whereas i think its sorry i city could get your clean sheet but then lewis may not get may not start or may not even get the hour needed to get the clean sheet as well thats the other thing he could be subbed at half time now pep so they havent got the fit squad though you got to think lis will start but i just its easier to score a goal than it is to keep a clean j for 90 minutes thats very true and brighton will probably score maybe it is better to go with the attacking player again im open to persuasion friday night to see what happens but i think i think youre right i probably will go on the attack i do like the salanki captain cuz ive got harand and salah covered so therefore the damage that they can do in terms of if they haul is minimized by the fact i own them both whereas going salanki is a big differential and if he did come in with another double figure that would be a big swing in my favor i think this i think you could overtake me this week because theres not a lot wrong here is there are the trip i think poo could easily get a double figure if he gets sp if spurs win that 40 and porro and johnson both get returns ive got you ive got youre in my sights well see the rivalry this is the deciding season as well isnt it not its going to be that last one but its two all so this is no this is it no whoever wins this black box finishes at the end of this season so youve had enough youve had enough of the tantrums and the technical problems enough of the tantrums enough of bloody people in the chat having a go at me about barco its over i saw that was that was there some serious barco backlash i know people been a bit dick in the in the chat tonight so ive given a few people a timeout so they can think about what theyve done okay all right i dont i dont know why people have to bring barco up when was i it wasnt it wasnt about barco put you on a timeout next time you exactly so its all to play for isnt it i do think this is what i said a few weeks back its much more enjoyable season were not doing brilliantly and not many content creators are its a rarity that you see a content creator flying this season but i dont think many content creators will say that its not a better season as in terms of whats on offer from the game right i love it i think its great and i like the fact people look at my team and think its its crap because i look at it and think theres potential there with foden and and kuna and sanki captain and everyones team is going to be different and everyone is going to be biased to think that players they havent got in their team arent as good because thats why weve picked the players that weve got and not gone for the for the other ones so its fascinating theres going to be people and in a few weeks theres going to be people with teams without sacka and then people are going to say why is your team got sacka and its like because ive got palmer and sah and harand and its its its interesting at the moment were seeing like certain premium players dropping in form and things its going be when weve got if we get if we get to a point where weve got son saaka palmer harland and salah all delivering points and then you got hts and eak as well that and watkins maybe its its amazing itll be a great state of affairs i think the defenders not keeping clean sheets has changed things as well because were flashing money out and the four five aint nor is suddenly a hot property which i love it i love that as well its great weve got one super chat from at boy to address before we go thank you for the six year that boy and for your youre always there in chat thank you for all your support you always a support of the show great showers do you avoid starting a defender that plays one of your attackers i own vardy and have to have to start ana or maz rui so vardy is at united does he start maz ri a think you have to dont you i know what hes saying there dont you an i love i do think we could concede theres a theres a world in which we win one nil for sure cuz newcastle arent scoring a lot of goals and we are very strong defensively and it could be one of those games where one goal decides it so ana might not be a bad bet at all its not a bad choice to go ana but i do think united clean sheet against leicester is probably the most likely outcome dont you as i love that question because thats exactly what i asked you earlier is how much has that impact on it and ideally youd play mazari and not think twice about it because its a home game you didnt have v but then youve got vardy and youre thinking well i want vardy to score and then if he does score i dont want to be annoyed when mazari l his sheet i think it would it depends on my belly for a risk wouldnt it if where i am now i probably would go vard and ana and go because or you bench or you bench vardy and play mazari and ana i maybe think about that i i dont think but thens got penalties isnt he thats the thing i just dont know like they will low block and they will counter and vardy has got that turner pace and you maybe united go there go high line and vard i think id play i think id play vardy and mrai because i think theres all i think either way youre going to either get points from vardy or mazwi because if ler score itll be through vardy and if they dont the mai score so i think i i think id lean towards that but close good one at booy very good question which chimed with what we talked about tonight good show as thank you for that thank you for the 1200 still watching and all the support tonight wow amazing and i think this is my favorite season for three or four years i think possibly right up there with one of my favorites so far i hope it stays on this vein and i hope our teams remain aart not just our teams but everyone out there as well and its just a much more enjoyable season for it so looking forward to what this week brings i go into every game week thinking this could be one extreme or the other whereas last season it was like itll be another small red or small green whereas now it could be a big red or a big green or something extreme like that and me and you are tussling for the ranks now so i know im glad youve closed the gap makes it more interesting thats the thing i spent so long last season like even at like 3m in the first 10 weeks i was like 32m 29m 34m and like that like its im exactly the same rank as what i was like four weeks ago but its been like 800k 14m 500k yes i its been its been a lot more its been a lot more interesting and i think it when you see a player like sank gets 16 points and you look at your rank and you see the impact its had and its like wow hes not that highly owned because people have put so much money into salah and haren they cant afford salanki you got good managers without players like salanki because they cant theyve gone a different route which is also completely viable and well pay off in different weeks but every strategy is going to have its time to shine and its comms in which one was the one which will be which was the correct one bring it on bring on another game week maybe r it maybe green but well enjoy it anyway hopefully we keep saying that throughout the season thank you again for everyone who joined in tonight well see you soon hit the like if you enjoyed it hit the subscribe if youre new around here let me just let me just put that up look ive got the animation ive hard to use it there it is there we go look at that beautiful no beautiful and well see you well see you after the break it might be the second week before we go into game week

into the end and christmas fixtures its a good night for me good night everyone for,26236
9,fplblackbox,1RDa1lLOWtQ,FPL Dom Delivers | GW10,2024-11-05T00:04:40Z,[Music] [Applause] what to go [Music] game week 10 then and another blank for harand that's just one return in five absolutely incredible um two undefeat for City at bouth Harland had five shots two big chances really frustrating again just snatching at the m and and it's just not running for him I mean it will change but then how long do we hold him I mean the tactic is in many circles now get rid of Harland for game week 12 move to Palmer start bringing in Arsenal assets again and it's hard to build a case not to do that it's Brighton next for Holland I think that is a good fixure for him and I think we hold for that if you still have him and then look at Game gameweek 12 as we say Spurs at home L is a good fixture so I think there's much to debate when we get there but as for this game week yeah frustrated again as I said it was the five shots 0.90 um XG in the game so a strong output in terms of data foden came out even better four shots and one chance created 1.04 was the most in the game week so far after Saturday's games but he again frustrated I got rid and I don't really regret that particularly with de brne back on the bench now for City that that would indicate to me that you know Pep's going to try and get de brne back in that team for obvious reasons to get things ticking again and what does that mean for fodm with with Savio around with dku around Savio surprisingly fit and back on the bench in this game after being carried off in midweek so foden for me although he stood out here is a concern going forward now that the bo is fit Elsewhere for City Vel got his third goal the season which is you know obviously ridiculous output for a Defender so far he started Lewis didn't now as a Lewis owner that is a little bit of a concern particularly after what pep said of the week about him he couldn't rest him he's the one player who couldn't rest him what does he do benches in for Bournemouth so predictable pep does like having fun with us doesn't he I'm not worried as a Lewis owner he's a player that I I don't rely on as my defensive free but I want to bring in with fixture and I think he will get back in the team after that rest as for vardal two clean sheets for City although the goal output is impressive I don't I don't really want to spend that amount on a player in a defense who who still concede goals um so for me V is a noo unless we're going to change our tactics and start spending big in defense and that's not the way it's going it's all going into Midfield which is why we're looking to get rid of Harland as for bouth I mean they have the one of the key players when it comes to saving money and that is seeno 56 he was impressive again here seven shots involvements I think it was four shots three chances created in the game um what was it 0.71 he exra ey from the from this game week right up there I think will be by the end of the game week if you got rid then I think you're going to want him back because on the ticker Balou for second only to woles uh over the next 11 12 game weeks so the fixtures are good for for seeno and bouth and he is clearly to stand out despite Evan Nelson get his third goal the season and kir has two assists for Bournemouth it's seeno the key asset [Music] but Arsenal also slipped up of course one- nil defeat at Newcastle and this was a really disappointing performance by Arsenal 1.05 the XG created in the game and sacka came out of it with just two shots and one chance created 0.45 xgi havs just one shot it's not enough is it um and we're starting to see them stutter with the injuries and dense in confidence Gabrielle did come back into the team to help their defense but it's now just uh what is it five of out a clean sheet now for Arsenal they've moved down to the fourth ranked defense in the league they're the seventh ranked attack in the league when looking at XG data so suddenly they're just they're not registering their Elite numbers and and assets like sackur and havs aren't the kind of go-tos that they were before I mean the fixtures have been tougher for them and certainly from gameweek 13 onwards that's when we're really starting to get interested in Arsenal once again and I think I will be moving to at least one of sacka or have averts but I'm probably not going to load up on that arsal defense until I see a bit more solidity I think it's at fullback they got the problem lot of rotation lot of injuries there lot of unsettled situations in that defense which has has meant that ryer and celba and Gabrielle really dropped off in terms of output as for Newcastle as isak and gold new combin for the goal no surprise they're their two key players but 0.53 xgi or XG in the game for new car suggest that they they haven't found the fluidity yet uh they go to Forest they go to City ground next and that's not going to be an easy game for Newcastle so I don't think that we're in any hurry to look at Newcastle but they could yet be some used to us over the season that's for [Music] sure Liverpool do what Liverpool been doing all season grinding out the result One n down to a Brighton side that Lo they had looked like they had the better of them in that first half which they did but slot did the magic again at Hal time didn't tweet tactically but just got more out of his team and they turned it round to win the game 2-1 Salah of course with the crucial winner a lot of lot of managers moved off Holland to Captain Salah and it worked out I captain Salah and it worked out and he came out the game with five shot involvements it was two chances created three shots for not for 65 xgi I guess the big news here though was the team news from slot he rested Diaz to the bench again started gakpo rested Robertson who looks now like he might have lost his place at left back to Simas and Simas came out with three chances created one shot as well 0.56 XG which significantly surpassed Tren Alexander Arnold who only created two chances for 0.10 so if Simas has got that left back spot now at 46 that's an obvious downgrade if you want to move money off Trent and it's becoming harder and harder by the game week to justify holding on to Trent Liverpool defense is still top ranked it's still one we've got to consider um despite conceding here but they lost canate to an arm injury and it was interesting that Gomez at 48 was the player to come off the bench not Quant to replace him so there could be another budget option there and I guess you got to ask with with Simas and Gomez perhaps in that starting Liverpool defense now are they going to be as secure they've done okay with with Allison out and he'll be back soon we would have fought after the international break so that might signal another increase in solidity at the back for Liverpool with Allison there although Keller has been good so they were a defense and a team that we got to look at but it's in attack where it's all about and I think with J out injured and now Diaz benched again it is boiling down to you got to have Salah AR you and I think with the fixures that Liverpool have got and the form that he's shown nine points here almost a seventh double digit return his consistency is extraordinary and as we move away from Harland it's just becoming obvious that salah's got to be a Target ASA Brighton the one player that stood out for me and I mentioned in Black Box in the week cat Ogo who play played right Midfield rather than right right fullback and got his goal uh two shots and one chance created 0.30 xgi with Brighton's fixtures really perking up very very soon as part of that swing from game week 12 I think CAD Ogo as a Defender has got to be worth a look [Music] so I was at the city ground to witness the latest victory for for three in a row now absolutely extraordinary uh three and0 over West Ham it was very very routine and Chris Wood an eight for the season he is an absolute machine just can't be stopped uh two shots .79 XG I in the game um I mean cleared one off the line as well declared man of the mat I'm not sure he was there was a lot of good players on show for Forest but wood it's hard as I said to make a case against him because Forest are getting him the it was Moreno Who provided the assist uh in this game Mareno had his best attacking game for Forest but Ana also came out with a goal the other fallback and then minkovich was so unfortunate he had one just wide one headed just wide another effort palmed over by fabianski with a great save it's only a matter of time for milenovic gets that attack in return so so much potential in this Forest side haven't even talked about Hudson Ado who came out with eight shot involvements four shots four chances created got the goal of course so there's just value in that forest team everywhere the thing is the fixtures do stiffen up it's Newcastle then it switch but then it does get tougher for Forest but they're a team that are just not going to be a pushover for anyone and I think they're going to keep clean sheets when you don't expect them to as we saw at anfield so I I can't really back against going with one of the defense and Chris Wood at the moment although there are many many options up top eight goals for the season and the service just keeps coming and the confidence that Forest side is just on such a new level uh and it was so obvious that there was a golf in ability I think in what we saw in that game against West Ham but a golf in also the confidence level the spirit in the team West Ham looks shot absolutely shot I'd be very surprise if L can hold on to that job and if you've got boing yeah I mean I I admire you for the differential but that West Ham team just aren't playing well there's no confidence no Spirit there and and I think they're going to struggle while ly I just can't see him finding the solution so for me West Ham remain and noo Forest the [Music] opposite it's switch one Lester one pretty predictable outcome from this game and I guess it was only a matter of time before Leaf Davis rewarded his owners as well if you didn't bench him like as have to enjoy that so Leaf Davis with the goal came out with three chances created and the one shot 0.31 xgi he is a great asset in a promoted side but it's a promoted side that is going to concede goals not keep clean sheets and they're not going to score too many either so it's very similar to what we saw with d last season although I do think the leave Davis is a step up it's tough fixtures to come now though Spurs United and then Firs for it switch so if you're holding Davis you're probably going to bench him over those games anyway as for Leicester B A not to stand out I think he's outstanding another six shot involvements three chances created three shots and the fixtures do turn from game week's 14 onwards for Leicester and I I think like he bit like Leaf Davis he's never going to be an asset that we can rely on and play every week but when fixtures are good I think he's a player we got to look at and that run for leester is tempting and he is absolutely outstanding for me [Music] so anom w Everton Neil a game of little consequence really in fbl terms apart from more Agony for Calvi lein owners I I shouldn't tease them but it's now six successive blanks with a start he only played an hour here before ironically being replaced by Betto Who had who had Everton's best chances and perhaps should have got them at least an equalizer and beta came on and topped the xgi in this game as well calv L only had one shot he's had I think 16 shots over the six last six starts without a goal um and yeah he would he would he hold his place I guess they keep faith in him but I don't know I I think if you're holding calv lein you're this long this was the fixure that you were going to hold him for but then you've got to get rid and I just think there's too many options now uh as for M Neil he came back and I didn't expect him to and it is West Ham and brenford next there are two defenses that are going to give up chances so if you're holding it now I think you can you can stay patient and less so I think with calv Le given the confidence and given the profile for better which is rising all the time uh as for Southampton not too much to talk about from a fancy perspective if you had Harwood Bellis and started him well done first clean sheet for Southampton H and as for dibling owners they saw their player benched and so he's perhaps becoming a fringe player again and not that four five budget option that we hoped he would be [Music] entertaining draw at molu to all um a lot of investment in this game in ain't Nori and kuna and I I think it's warranted we say that you know the fixture ticker is just overwhelmingly positive for O'Neal's side and I think those two assets showed enough in this game to think that we'll get returns from them kuna came out with an assist but again he was he's their one key player strand lson got the goal set up by kuna but he also set up three other chances came out of it at 0.32 xgi but he's by far their key player and I think he will be profitable for FB managers over this run as for eight Nori I think he had a couple of shots no chances created you're not going to get clean sheets in I don't think that will be a rarity so you are relying on attacking returns a bit like Leaf Davis but I do see think it's warranted given his price 46 and given the fixtures that got but kuna for me is the big standout as for Palace they're really a nogo in fancy terms particularly why a is out so not really anything to talk about of note here maybe when a is back we we'll start seeing some appeal but right now the interest is all about WS in this game and it's Justified [Music] so that's it for Saturday's games uh not going badly for me this week CU I had the Sal captaincy and also I started seeno and bench Lewis nothing Shady there before you say it I just thought the Bournemouth would score and obviously that would mean start seeno and bench Lewis um worked out for me Sania with the goal and like I said a player I'm going to hold on to now I've got five players no six players left to go including four in the Spurs Villa game so so I've got Pao Johnson Rogers and salanki big game for salanki If he if he really doesn't show up in this game and I mean just a couple of shots would be nice wouldn't it then I think that he's going to be a big sell very very soon I'll probably hold him for the it switch game but after that he's going to be gone unless we say something spectacular here big game I think for Villa as well I mean Watkins that you know I think he needs of a turn in this game to hold off to stve off that move towards the cheaper Strikers like Kuna who we've discussed and Rogers you know he's one of several midfielders that may make weigh in teams I've talked about those who got rid of seeno I've got Johnson seeno hbmo and Rogers one of those has got to go because obviously salah's not going to go when I move to Palmer and right now I am thinking it could be Rogers so how he performs and what he produces in this game could be key to whether that changes my mind well I asked for the spectacular from San and I got it a 16o return biggest of the season five shots All In The Box 1.52 xgi the top in the game week so far with one game to go we got what we wanted from him um I think the difference was that he was spending much more time in central areas further forward and they were getting crosses in that's the big thing I mean it as it turned out Johnson's goal Johnson got a goal from his only shot in the game he took that off the toe of sank it could have easily been a hattick he had a half chance in the first half as well so much better from Dominic salanki just when we needed it as well obviously a massive return for my team more on that in a bit Johnson also came in only had that one shot as I say not point6 for is XG from that effort but it's seven goals in 11 games now for Johnson no question that he is a threat and he's and he's getting more minutes there is just no one Off the Bench who can replace him he was absolutely shattered at the end but but an isn't really subbing him early anymore um so that's a key thing he's on the pitch at the death um unlike son who only had two chances created in the game very quiet overall obviously created that goal got the assist for Johnson um but yeah really didn't have a Major Impact was very myth to go off on the hour mark was a bit of a surprise because it was one all at the time but in the end rardon came on and set up that goal got an assist himself so for sank second so yeah overall a great attacking performance by Spurs and they're the only team now who are averaging over two xgi non- penalty per 90 they are the top attacking side and they take that record into its which at home next who have an XGC non penalty P 2.15 so it's the best attack versus the best defense when it comes to XG and XG conceded coming next and as a manager who holds porro Johnson and salanki that's got to be encouraging do you do you hold slanky for that course you do and maybe after as well they go to Man City and week 12 that'll be the crunch fixture because I won't know whether I need to get rid of Johnson or salanki what I do with Spurs but their fixures after that aren't too bad and I actually think you know we've seen Spurs go to the EAD and cause them problems and we're seeing a lot of teams this season cause City problems so I'm not against taking my Spurs players into that and perhaps if you have to hold salanki for the trip to the Yad if it's off another return against it rich that might not be a bad thing as for Villa in this game Rogers gave me plenty of food for for as well I talk about whether it was him I was going to get rid of he got the goal obviously he couldn't miss it from the corner it was a bad mistake at the set piece Again by Spurs who really struggle with those don't they um but yeah he did his piece I mean he he had four shots uh no four shot involvements two chances created Two Shots Watkins in contrast was very very quiet just two shots 0.46 three touches in the Box just one goal in four now for Watkins and that's a concern he got a price drop overnight so people are moving him out and I can't say I blame them really because those cheaper options as I said are very very tempting and it's Liverpool way next before the fixtures pick up with Palace brenford of Southampton the next three at Villa Park so maybe a hold but I can see why people needing to flush the cash out are getting rid of Watkins one1 at Old Trafford and that last a goal War turn for Bruno from the spot um I mean basically it's been due he's had five shots in each of his last two games he had eight shot involvements in this game four chances created four shots the penalty was in the end the decisive action but yeah the data has been pointing to this and pointing to a surgence in Bruno could he become an elite asset again under amarim I don't know I mean the fixtures are certainly there there's no doubt Lester it's which Everton the next three for United but I do look at their attack and think rashford gach show hland are these ruthless takers of chances that Bruno is going to get assist from that's the that's the key issue United I think it's nine goals all season only Southampton I think have scored less so are we going to see that overnight Resurgence of that United attack I think it's a big ask but obviously if you got to make up ground with those fixtures Bruno could be an option the issue for me is just the Midfield places I've spoken about what am I going to do to make room for Palmer and yeah finding a place for Bruno as well I I just don't see it and for me that it's a little bit optimistic on the impact of the new manager as for Chelsea I mean Palma had a fairly quiet game still sneaked in for one bonus points low six shot involvements on the day three shots three chances created 0.71 xgi I don't think he had his best game less impactful than I would want and it interesting as well he he started out on the left hand side again rather than the right and I think he's coupled with Reese James because when Reese James switched in the second half and karella came on we saw Palmer go with James as well back to the right hand side so I think there's something going on there with morasa tying up Reese James with with Palmer because on the other side he inverts the fallback which obviously uses up the spaces that Palmer would be in on that flank so I think that's a thing to watch for I think it's debatable yet whether that's impacting Palmer's output but there's no question for gameweek 12 with the fixtures Chelsea has got he's got to be a Target I don't I don't think I'm going to change my plan there he's coming in in game week 12 and I'm going to have to sell Harland to make way for that move else were for Chelsea not too much to talk about other than Jackson picking up his fourth yellow card the season he had one chance cre that's all really a disappointing game for him and that fourth yellow makes him a risk now among other players we talked about seeno yesterday forgot to mention he's on four bookings as well along with eight Nory so we've got to watch that now we're getting close to those first suspensions and they should be factors in our thinking when it comes to transfers well that was a crazy game um as a fleen owner it was absolutely heartbreaking I knew it would happen I absolutely knew it he was sitting on 12 points got 10 saves and I was I was chatting to as on WhatsApp going and as me said to me when do you think he'll break your heart and I said when he gets maximum bonus then he then he'll the bed and he did exactly that in spectacular style brenford completely blowing it conceding two late goals fleen going from 12 points to four it would have been an amazing hall for a keeper that hasn't kept the clean sheet All Season against a team who have scored in every game it was inevitable I knew it would happen and it did um and um so to be honest I dealt with it okay and and to be honest I had a good game we more than that in a minute but from the game very low impact on fantasy really uh Wilson Bas Robinson got an assist he was probably the only asset to come out with points in the game that had impact on fbl uh himz went off after 70 minutes had two shots 0.09 xgi so really low xgi in the game back-to-back blanks for himz now don't think it's a major concern and they've got Crystal Palace and wolves next so the fixures are still good for him and his owners and although munees is there I think it will take another couple of blanks then you got to start to worry so there is concern particularly if he doesn't get a goal the next two um elsewhere inuma is completely Anonymous for brenford as an attacking Force they were they were just not at the races at all they got the early goal and then they just sat on it and I guess they got what they deserved in a way because they didn't show Too Much ambition um but yeah so very little in the game um for for FPL managers in the end uh I came out of it a Four Points of fle and I'll take that and three for bumo I'll definitely take that brenford got Bournemouth Everton and Leicester next no clean sheets for for fleen there but I'll certainly take the Four Points it's just a heartbreak in having had the 12 but 75 points for the game week for me which is which is crazy um just what I needed up to 1.4 million a rank gain of 1.9 million which is exactly what I said on blackbox last week I said that although I was having a bad season for rank I always felt this season there were big Point swings in it because of the way that the variety of teams uh and the variation in The Heavy Hitters and um yeah just by playing Sano and Captain in Salah and obviously Johnson came in as well as did Rogers I had this massive rank climb so I'm I feel much better about my rank now and ongoing continue to enjoy this season so let's see how it goes from here um hope you had a good game week just a bit of injury that came in today uh canate is fit looks like he's going to be okay so no danger there if you own canate and and no appeal for Gomez if you were thinking of going that way elsewhere Palmer apparently picked up a knee injury from that from that uh Tackle by Martinez I'm that didn't look serious to me but there's there's lots of stories going around about that uh and also harand picked up a training injury there was something on sky today which is pretty laughable I don't believe a word of that and obviously they've got the European game coming up so we'll get it on that um we'll round all that up on blackbox we'll be back uh on Thursday I think it'll be so me and a will be talking then uh I'm I've closed the gap on him feel a lot better feel more optimistic hope you do too crazy game week lots more to come hope you like this hit the Subscribe button if you're new and if you did like the video hit like and I'll see you next time,4988,what to go game week 10 then and another blank for harand thats just one return in five absolutely incredible two undefeat for city at bouth harland had five shots two big chances frustrating again just snatching at the m and its just not running for him it will change but then how long do we hold him the tactic is in many circles now get rid of harland for game week 12 move to palmer start bringing in arsenal assets again and its hard to build a case not to do that its brighton next for holland i think that is a good fixure for him and i think we hold for that if you still have him and then look at game gw 12 as we say spurs at home l is a good fixture so i think theres much to debate when we get there but as for this game week frustrated again as i said it was the five shots 090 xg in the game so a strong output in terms of data foden came out even better four shots and one chance created 104 was the most in the game week so far after saturdays games but he again frustrated i got rid and i dont regret that particularly with de brne back on the bench now for city that would indicate to me that peps going to try and get de brne back in that team for obvious reasons to get things ticking again and what does that mean for fodm with savio around with dku around savio surprisingly fit and back on the bench in this game after being carried off in midweek so foden for me although he stood out here is a concern going forward now that the bo is fit elsewhere for city vel got his third goal the season which is ridiculous output for a defender so far he started lewis didnt now as a lewis owner that is a little bit of a concern particularly after what pep said of the week about him he couldnt rest him hes the one player who couldnt rest him what does he do benches in for bournemouth so predictable pep does like having fun with us doesnt he im not worried as a lewis owner hes a player that i dont rely on as my defensive free but i want to bring in with fixture and i think he will get back in the team after that rest as for vardal two clean sheets for city although the goal output is impressive i dont i dont want to spend that amount on a player in a defense who still concede goals so for me v is a noo unless were going to change our tactics and start spending big in defense and thats not the way its going its all going into midfield which is why were looking to get rid of harland as for bouth they have the one of the key players when it comes to saving money and that is seeno 56 he was impressive again here seven shots involvements i think it was four shots three chances created in the game what was it 071 he exra ey from the from this game week right up there i think will be by the end of the game week if you got rid then i think youre going to want him back because on the ticker balou for second only to woles over the next 11 12 game weeks so the fixtures are good for seeno and bouth and he is clearly to stand out despite evan nelson get his third goal the season and kir has two assists for bournemouth its seeno the key asset but arsenal also slipped up of course one nil defeat at newcastle and this was a disappointing performance by arsenal 105 the xg created in the game and sacka came out of it with just two shots and one chance created 045 xgi havs just one shot its not enough is it and were starting to see them stutter with the injuries and dense in confidence gabrielle did come back into the team to help their defense but its now just what is it five of out a clean sheet now for arsenal theyve moved down to the fourth ranked defense in the league theyre the seventh ranked attack in the league when looking at xg data so suddenly theyre just theyre not registering their elite numbers and assets like sackur and havs arent the gotos that they were before the fixtures have been tougher for them and certainly from gw 13 onwards thats when were starting to get interested in arsenal once again and i think i will be moving to at least one of sacka or have averts but im probably not going to load up on that arsal defense until i see a bit more solidity i think its at fullback they got the problem lot of rotation lot of injuries there lot of unsettled situations in that defense which has meant that ryer and celba and gabrielle dropped off in terms of output as for newcastle as isak and gold new combin for the goal no surprise theyre their two key players but 053 xgi or xg in the game for new car suggest that they havent found the fluidity yet they go to forest they go to city ground next and thats not going to be an easy game for newcastle so i dont think that were in any hurry to look at newcastle but they could yet be some used to us over the season thats for sure liverpool do what liverpool been doing all season grinding out the result one n down to a brighton side that lo they had looked like they had the better of them in that first half which they did but slot did the magic again at hal time didnt tweet tactically but just got more out of his team and they turned it round to win the game 21 salah of course with the crucial winner a lot of lot of managers moved off holland to captain salah and it worked out i captain salah and it worked out and he came out the game with five shot involvements it was two chances created three shots for not for 65 xgi the big news here though was the team news from slot he rested diaz to the bench again started gakpo rested robertson who looks now like he might have lost his place at left back to simas and simas came out with three chances created one shot as well 056 xg which significantly surpassed tren alexander arnold who only created two chances for 010 so if simas has got that left back spot now at 46 thats an obvious downgrade if you want to move money off trent and its becoming harder and harder by the game week to justify holding on to trent liverpool defense is still top ranked its still one weve got to consider despite conceding here but they lost canate to an arm injury and it was interesting that gomez at 48 was the player to come off the bench not quant to replace him so there could be another budget option there and you got to ask with simas and gomez perhaps in that starting liverpool defense now are they going to be as secure theyve done okay with allison out and hell be back soon we would have fought after the international break so that might signal another increase in solidity at the back for liverpool with allison there although keller has been good so they were a defense and a team that we got to look at but its in attack where its all about and i think with j out injured and now diaz benched again it is boiling down to you got to have salah ar you and i think with the fixures that liverpool have got and the form that hes shown nine points here almost a seventh double digit return his consistency is extraordinary and as we move away from harland its just becoming obvious that salahs got to be a target asa brighton the one player that stood out for me and i mentioned in black box in the week cat ogo who play played right midfield rather than right fullback and got his goal two shots and one chance created 030 xgi with brightons fixtures perking up very soon as part of that swing from game week 12 i think cad ogo as a defender has got to be worth a look so i was at the city ground to witness the latest victory for three in a row now absolutely extraordinary three and0 over west ham it was very routine and chris wood an eight for the season he is an absolute machine just cant be stopped two shots 79 xg i in the game cleared one off the line as well declared man of the mat im not sure he was there was a lot of good players on show for forest but wood its hard as i said to make a case against him because forest are getting him the it was moreno who provided the assist in this game mareno had his best attacking game for forest but ana also came out with a goal the other fallback and then minkovich was so unfortunate he had one just wide one headed just wide another effort palmed over by fabianski with a great save its only a matter of time for milenovic gets that attack in return so much potential in this forest side havent even talked about hudson ado who came out with eight shot involvements four shots four chances created got the goal of course so theres just value in that forest team everywhere the thing is the fixtures do stiffen up its newcastle then it switch but then it does get tougher for forest but theyre a team that are just not going to be a pushover for anyone and i think theyre going to keep clean sheets when you dont expect them to as we saw at anfield so i cant back against going with one of the defense and chris wood at the moment although there are many options up top eight goals for the season and the service just keeps coming and the confidence that forest side is just on such a new level and it was so obvious that there was a golf in ability i think in what we saw in that game against west ham but a golf in also the confidence level the spirit in the team west ham looks shot absolutely shot id be very surprise if l can hold on to that job and if youve got boing i admire you for the differential but that west ham team just arent playing well theres no confidence no spirit there and i think theyre going to struggle while ly i just cant see him finding the solution so for me west ham remain and noo forest the opposite its switch one lester one pretty predictable outcome from this game and it was only a matter of time before leaf davis rewarded his owners as well if you didnt bench him like as have to enjoy that so leaf davis with the goal came out with three chances created and the one shot 031 xgi he is a great asset in a promoted side but its a promoted side that is going to concede goals not keep clean sheets and theyre not going to score too many either so its very similar to what we saw with d last season although i do think the leave davis is a step up its tough fixtures to come now though spurs united and then firs for it switch so if youre holding davis youre probably going to bench him over those games anyway as for leicester b a not to stand out i think hes outstanding another six shot involvements three chances created three shots and the fixtures do turn from game weeks 14 onwards for leicester and i think like he bit like leaf davis hes never going to be an asset that we can rely on and play every week but when fixtures are good i think hes a player we got to look at and that run for leester is tempting and he is absolutely outstanding for me so anom w everton neil a game of little consequence in fbl terms apart from more agony for calvi lein owners i shouldnt tease them but its now six successive blanks with a start he only played an hour here before ironically being replaced by betto who had who had evertons best chances and perhaps should have got them at least an equalizer and beta came on and topped the xgi in this game as well calv l only had one shot hes had i think 16 shots over the six last six starts without a goal and he would he would he hold his place they keep faith in him but i dont know i think if youre holding calv lein youre this long this was the fixure that you were going to hold him for but then youve got to get rid and i just think theres too many options now as for m neil he came back and i didnt expect him to and it is west ham and brenford next there are two defenses that are going to give up chances so if youre holding it now i think you can you can stay patient and less so i think with calv le given the confidence and given the profile for better which is rising all the time as for southampton not too much to talk about from a fancy perspective if you had harwood bellis and started him well done first clean sheet for southampton h and as for dibling owners they saw their player benched and so hes perhaps becoming a fringe player again and not that four five budget option that we hoped he would be entertaining draw at molu to all a lot of investment in this game in aint nori and kuna and i think its warranted we say that the fixture ticker is just overwhelmingly positive for oneals side and i think those two assets showed enough in this game to think that well get returns from them kuna came out with an assist but again he was hes their one key player strand lson got the goal set up by kuna but he also set up three other chances came out of it at 032 xgi but hes by far their key player and i think he will be profitable for fb managers over this run as for eight nori i think he had a couple of shots no chances created youre not going to get clean sheets in i dont think that will be a rarity so you are relying on attacking returns a bit like leaf davis but i do see think its warranted given his price 46 and given the fixtures that got but kuna for me is the big standout as for palace theyre a nogo in fancy terms particularly why a is out so not anything to talk about of note here maybe when a is back well start seeing some appeal but right now the interest is all about ws in this game and its justified so thats it for saturdays games not going badly for me this week cu i had the sal captaincy and also i started seeno and bench lewis nothing shady there before you say it i just thought the bournemouth would score and that would mean start seeno and bench lewis worked out for me sania with the goal and like i said a player im going to hold on to now ive got five players no six players left to go including four in the spurs villa game so ive got pao johnson rogers and salanki big game for salanki if he if he doesnt show up in this game and just a couple of shots would be nice wouldnt it then i think that hes going to be a big sell very soon ill probably hold him for the it switch game but after that hes going to be gone unless we say something spectacular here big game i think for villa as well watkins that i think he needs of a turn in this game to hold off to stve off that move towards the cheaper strikers like kuna who weve discussed and rogers hes one of several midfielders that may make weigh in teams ive talked about those who got rid of seeno ive got johnson seeno hbmo and rogers one of those has got to go because salahs not going to go when i move to palmer and right now i am thinking it could be rogers so how he performs and what he produces in this game could be key to whether that changes my mind well i asked for the spectacular from san and i got it a 16o return biggest of the season five shots all in the box 152 xgi the top in the game week so far with one game to go we got what we wanted from him i think the difference was that he was spending much more time in central areas further forward and they were getting crosses in thats the big thing it as it turned out johnsons goal johnson got a goal from his only shot in the game he took that off the toe of sank it could have easily been a hattick he had a half chance in the first half as well so much better from dominic salanki just when we needed it as well a massive return for my team more on that in a bit johnson also came in only had that one shot as i say not point6 for is xg from that effort but its seven goals in 11 games now for johnson no question that he is a threat and hes and hes getting more minutes there is just no one off the bench who can replace him he was absolutely shattered at the end but an isnt subbing him early anymore so thats a key thing hes on the pitch at the death unlike son who only had two chances created in the game very quiet overall created that goal got the assist for johnson but didnt have a major impact was very myth to go off on the hour mark was a bit of a surprise because it was one all at the time but in the end rardon came on and set up that goal got an assist himself so for sank second so overall a great attacking performance by spurs and theyre the only team now who are averaging over two xgi non penalty per 90 they are the top attacking side and they take that record into its which at home next who have an xgc non penalty p 215 so its the best attack versus the best defense when it comes to xg and xg conceded coming next and as a manager who holds porro johnson and salanki thats got to be encouraging do you do you hold slanky for that course you do and maybe after as well they go to man city and week 12 thatll be the crunch fixture because i wont know whether i need to get rid of johnson or salanki what i do with spurs but their fixures after that arent too bad and i think weve seen spurs go to the ead and cause them problems and were seeing a lot of teams this season cause city problems so im not against taking my spurs players into that and perhaps if you have to hold salanki for the trip to the yad if its off another return against it rich that might not be a bad thing as for villa in this game rogers gave me plenty of food for as well i talk about whether it was him i was going to get rid of he got the goal he couldnt miss it from the corner it was a bad mistake at the set piece again by spurs who struggle with those dont they but he did his piece he had four shots no four shot involvements two chances created two shots watkins in contrast was very quiet just two shots 046 three touches in the box just one goal in four now for watkins and thats a concern he got a price drop overnight so people are moving him out and i cant say i blame them because those cheaper options as i said are very tempting and its liverpool way next before the fixtures pick up with palace brenford of southampton the next three at villa park so maybe a hold but i can see why people needing to flush the cash out are getting rid of watkins one1 at old trafford and that last a goal war turn for bruno from the spot its been due hes had five shots in each of his last two games he had eight shot involvements in this game four chances created four shots the penalty was in the end the decisive action but the data has been pointing to this and pointing to a surgence in bruno could he become an elite asset again under amarim i dont know the fixtures are certainly theres no doubt lester its which everton the next three for united but i do look at their attack and think rashford gach show hland are these ruthless takers of chances that bruno is going to get assist from thats the thats the key issue united i think its nine goals all season only southampton i think have scored less so are we going to see that overnight resurgence of that united attack i think its a big ask but if you got to make up ground with those fixtures bruno could be an option the issue for me is just the midfield places ive spoken about what am i going to do to make room for palmer and finding a place for bruno as well i just dont see it and for me that its a little bit optimistic on the impact of the new manager as for chelsea palma had a fairly quiet game still sneaked in for one bonus points low six shot involvements on the day three shots three chances created 071 xgi i dont think he had his best game less impactful than i would want and it interesting as well he started out on the left hand side again rather than the right and i think hes coupled with reese james because when reese james switched in the second half and karella came on we saw palmer go with james as well back to the right hand side so i think theres something going on there with morasa tying up reese james with palmer because on the other side he inverts the fallback which uses up the spaces that palmer would be in on that flank so i think thats a thing to watch for i think its debatable yet whether thats impacting palmers output but theres no question for gw 12 with the fixtures chelsea has got hes got to be a target i dont i dont think im going to change my plan there hes coming in game week 12 and im going to have to sell harland to make way for that move else were for chelsea not too much to talk about other than jackson picking up his fourth yellow card the season he had one chance cre thats all a disappointing game for him and that fourth yellow makes him a risk now among other players we talked about seeno yesterday forgot to mention hes on four bookings as well along with eight nory so weve got to watch that now were getting close to those first suspensions and they should be factors in our thinking when it comes to transfers well that was a crazy game as a fleen owner it was absolutely heartbreaking i knew it would happen i absolutely knew it he was sitting on 12 points got 10 saves and i was i was chatting to as on whatsapp going and as me said to me when do you think hell break your heart and i said when he gets maximum bonus then he then hell the bed and he did exactly that in spectacular style brenford completely blowing it conceding two late goals fleen going from 12 points to four it would have been an amazing hall for a keeper that hasnt kept the clean sheet all season against a team who have scored in every game it was inevitable i knew it would happen and it did and so to be honest i dealt with it okay and to be honest i had a good game we more than that in a minute but from the game very low impact on fantasy wilson bas robinson got an assist he was probably the only asset to come out with points in the game that had impact on fbl himz went off after 70 minutes had two shots 009 xgi so low xgi in the game backtoback blanks for himz now dont think its a major concern and theyve got crystal palace and wolves next so the fixures are still good for him and his owners and although munees is there i think it will take another couple of blanks then you got to start to worry so there is concern particularly if he doesnt get a goal the next two elsewhere inuma is completely anonymous for brenford as an attacking force they were they were just not at the races at all they got the early goal and then they just sat on it and they got what they deserved in a way because they didnt show too much ambition but so very little in the game for fpl managers in the end i came out of it a four points of fle and ill take that and three for bumo ill definitely take that brenford got bournemouth everton and leicester next no clean sheets for fleen there but ill certainly take the four points its just a heartbreak in having had the 12 but 75 points for the game week for me which is which is crazy just what i needed up to 14m a rank gain of 19m which is exactly what i said on blackbox last week i said that although i was having a bad season for rank i always felt this season there were big point swings in it because of the way that the variety of teams and the variation in the heavy hitters and just by playing sano and captain in salah and johnson came in as well as did rogers i had this massive rank climb so im i feel much better about my rank now and ongoing continue to enjoy this season so lets see how it goes from here hope you had a good game week just a bit of injury that came in today canate is fit looks like hes going to be okay so no danger there if you own canate and no appeal for gomez if you were thinking of going that way elsewhere palmer apparently picked up a knee injury from that from that tackle by martinez im that didnt look serious to me but theres theres lots of stories going around about that and also harand picked up a training injury there was something on sky today which is pretty laughable i dont believe a word of that and theyve got the european game coming up so well get it on that well round all that up on blackbox well be back on thursday i think itll be so me and a will be talking then im ive closed the gap on him feel a lot better feel more optimistic hope you do too crazy game week lots more to come hope you like this hit the subscribe button if youre new and if you did like the video hit like and ill see you next

11,FPLFocal,EX_Lv-yUFAU,FINAL FPL TEAM THOUGHTS GW11 ✅ SELL HAALAND? PALMER ⚠️,2024-11-08T14:22:32Z,welcome back for another video final thoughts and final video ahead of the deadline we're going to look at your biggest questions and dilemas this week we'll run through all the key news from today's press conferences to be aware for your teams and some final thoughts on my team in the final segment let's get into it first question from Fabian he says do we put our dignity behind us and give up on Cal Leen I love how this one's worded yeah I mean DCL has been an utter failure in FPL no returns from six games on the bounce now he barely made it past 60 Minutes last game not even guaranteed to start next game either but it sounds like there's a good chance based on dice's remarks it's West Ham next who have kept just one clean sheet old season which was back in game 2 but yeah in my of view it's time to get rid of him the three forward I've short listed for your consideration are kuna Strand lson and vissa with their fixtures below as well I mean we know all about wolves's upcoming fixture run so we won't keep banging on about that but I would favor them as a DCL replacement K if you got the extra money strand L if you don't basically V also deserves a mention cuz his underlying numbers have been ridiculously good this season he's still got three decent fixtures Bournemouth home everon away leester home but he is a shorter term pick basically you may want to sell him in like four game each time Calin Leen is statistically the worst finisher in the league over the last three seasons and that's where context is key although he's put up some reasonably good numbers at times his finishing quality is severely lacked wood for example the best finisher this season in the league in terms of conversion percent his underlying numbers have been similar to dcl's but he's backed about six or seven goals after that run of DCL blanks drive through AR who are the best 4.5 milish Defenders for longer term there's actually loads that I've got on the watch list so I'm going to pull them all up for consideration obviously my favorite be eight nor he's not here he's 4.7 mil though obviously make no mistake they're not going to keep loads of clean sheets but he's by far the most attacking of the lot he's 4.7 mil so slightly above 4 and A2 it's not a great entry point for quite a few of the 4 and a half mil Defenders this week though I think that coner dun can coob all have potential to be great picks but obviously not this week dunks injured as well probably back Game 12 and fixtures are amazing for like six or so weeks likewise Villa and Chelsea come back from the break with a really nice fixture run if you need one for this week then M Rari and H would be the two I've picked out for 4.5 mil and 4.3 mil there were lots of questions as well about Rico Lewis replacement so this slide should be helpful for that if I had to buy one this week it' be Mai if I was buying one in gamei 12 it' be Cowell if it was gamei 13 dunk that's the order I put them in anyway they're all very close to be honest big question from James harand Stick or twist now last week my view was that with two free transfers switching him to a cheaper forward to fun Sal was worth it but I felt that it wasn't worth a minus four though in the end har missed a bunch of chances and Salah scored so even a minus four would have actually paid off assuming that your Haren replacement was someone like K strand lson or isak who all returned I'm coming around to the idea of selling Harlem but in my case it's minus four but it does free up enough money for sacker and GIC 12 for Johnson so it's a Nee scenario in my case I do think amanus fall is Hard One to justify unless it does leave leave you with enough money in the bank for a big upside move like that in game week 12 I wouldn't sell Harlem this week unless it was to buy a s somehow personally the only other scenario where I'd consider minus four is if you've got a dud Midfield like E's injured then you could make the case for harand to or isach and then that injured or non-starter midfielder to Sal for minus four so for me I think it's twist one more week and then likely selling gami 12 after the break if any of you watching have got Harland and one free transfer what's your plan stick or twist the craziest part is over his recent bad patch re form he's still the best in the league for non penalty xgi over that run and he's almost regressed back to his XG total for the season in terms of actual goals scored having previously been on 10 goals from 5.57 XG my view in FPL these days is if a players consistently delivering Elite underline numbers they will come good and I'd much rather a player of good underline numbers that's blanked a few times than a player that's massively overperformed in a Purple Patch obviously Salah is not in a Purple Patch his numbers are great but I think it's a good point to make in general with FPL Alon always comes to mind when he went on that crazy run of scoring like every week out of nowhere for like a month and then he very suddenly went back to the bad asset he's always been but I do recognize is more nuanced of harand cuz he's the most expensive player in FB history and isach and Salah should outscore Harland and Rogers for example let's have a look at what the markets are saying this week projected goals by fixture and the clean sheet odds for gamei 11 graphic from Rob T so looking at the projected goals tottenham's 2.9 is top of all the fixtures this week then it's Man United 2.45 Liverpool 2.34 Man City 2.05 so son and salanki look like awesome captains this week offering huge rank upside given the lower ownership as opposed to someone like Salah and Harland that's the fixure that's expected to have the most goals Spurs are also top of the clean sheet odds as well they've been given a 38% chance and then it's Man United Liverpool and then it's Wolves West Ham and Man City tide I'm still in two minds about starting fabianski over Rya though this suggests I'm about 4% likely to get a clean sheet which isn't a lot so if you're going to Wild Card in GIC 12 over the there's some really good one big punts on the table this week porro Johnson's son sanki Bruno p7 says that considering a free hit something along the lines of Spurs players Kya Nori Dow Bruno and ask what's the best 11 this week oh this is just one man's view but I'd be reluctant to free hit in a single game week it's so much stronger than the triple captainship which I think is more justifiable in a single game this season obviously given that we've got two expected doubles as well this is the Scout selection for gamei 11 they basically do a free hit Team every week which comes from official FPL so let's try something new and look at that team and review it they've got cells in goal V oldo 8 nor in defense Salah Palmer Bruno and bumo Midfield and then they've got salanki Kun wood up front it's a pretty good team but if I was going to be free hitting I think I'd have son over Palmer quite comfortably and I'd have Pedro por over viio my gut feeling says that Newcastle is going to be much harder fixture for Forest so I'd also consider Vis over wood as a onewe punt home to Bournemouth lastly there's got to be some better goalkeeper picks for game mck 11 in isolation than Sals Anana Kell and faki maybe let me know in the comments actually would you like the Scout selection to be included in these every week moving forward or not interested last question and we'll move on panch asks is Watkins a keep I do think an overlooked facet of villa this season is the immense challenge that comes with juggling the champions league and it's new to pretty much the whole Squad as well which could be why we're seeing some results like a 4-1 loss to Spurs and then a lost to Club Brugge midweek as well which their favorites to win it's unbelievably hard to manage everyone's Fitness in the hardest possible schedule that said I look at Villa's games from game make 12 Palace home chelse way brenford home Southampton Home Three home games in four it doesn't seem like a rush to sell when you're on the cusp of some really good fixtures the only player I'd really consider selling him for is isach if you've got a bunch of transfers but that's a luxury move to me I might even buy Watkins and get me 12 myself if I sell Harland to emphasize that point on the fixtures Watkins owners let us know in the comments are you keeping him or selling him right let's run through some of the news from today's press conferences then Liverpool first so J remains sideline for a while slot said he's not going to train until one or two weeks after the international break so actually could be g 14 or 15 that he returns now Allison's still out until after the break as well which we knew in case you missed it canate played in the Champions League on Tuesday after fears of an injury last weekend he's fine good news if you've got Spurs assets posu says everyone came through the Galatasaray game unscathed Romero's got a chance of making game 11 he'll be assessed wner Mo vanen and richison all out he said the following about some we brought him back and in the first game he had a relapse what we don't want to do is put him back into that cycle again it's very easy to do we're managing his minutes and building him up he got a good 55 on the weekend and he got 45 last night hopefully we can build that up but ultimately it's about getting him back and keeping him back so based on those remarks he might get around 75 minutes this game week lots of absentees of Palace for their fixure against Fulham could be good news if any you've got Ral Smith F or Robinson even so and K has picked up a haming injury so he joins e Warton and Lura who are among those out injured plus Will Hughes is suspended for them maresco provided an update on Palmer he said the following Palmer's getting better and we still have two days to prepare for the game hopefully we can have him for a session at least on Saturday then we take a decision for the Arsenal game obviously Chelsea versus nsal is the very last game of the gameing so it's going to be a case of holding in him and hope he plays pep didn't have much to say at all his press conference he said greish is not available for Saturday's game despite being called up by England he said he doesn't expect any returners this week so more or less the same Squad that played in Lisbon when they lost 4-1 to sport him Savio started that one KB made the bench foden and harand vard and Lewis also started final FB thoughts of my team then this is how line up for gami 11 Ry vardo Gabrielle Pedro porro seeno Palmer and bumo Johnson wood Kar and harand I keep going back and forth from fabianski and ryer as we as we saw earlier The Bookies odds suggests that West Ham are 4% likely to keep a clean sheet which is next to nothing so it's still a coin toss I rate the Arsenal defense so much higher but it is a tough game away Chelsea there's big upside in double defense but I would be counting on the Palmer blank basically so it occurred to me just this morning that if I was to go harand to Strand lson and Rogers to sah I have exact money to go Johnson to sacker and get me 12 I somehow completely missed his path and I'm leaning towards doing it for minus 4 now it is quite risky cuz obviously harland's massive ownership but salers probably would be even higher in terms of effective ownership but further to that I'd be exposed to International break price changes so if sacker was nearing a rise I'd have to go early on him as well it's very tempting because then in gamei 12 I'd have a three premium Midfield whereas if I was to roll and then make the moves in gamei 12 instead I'd be waiting till gami 14 to get sacka so a minus 4 gets me ahead of the curve basically I'd have to bench one of seeno wood if I do which isn't great obviously probably have to be seeno would you be tempted to do it if you could get from Johnson to sacker and gami 12 let me know in the comments pretty good depth on the bench this week with Lewis and Rogers if Lewis starts anyway thanks very much for watching I've been working on a new stream intro which I'm going to use for the first time tomorrow you don't want to miss it we'll be live here around 9:00 a.m. UK time see you all then,2383,welcome back for another video final thoughts and final video ahead of the deadline were going to look at your biggest questions and dilemas this week well run

his recent bad patch re form hes still the best in the league for non penalty xgi over that run and hes almost regressed back to his xg total for the season in terms of actual goals scored having previously been on 10 goals from 557 xg my view in fpl these days is if a players consistently delivering elite underline numbers they will come good and id much rather a player of good underline numbers thats blanked a few times than a player thats massively overperformed in a purple patch salah is not in a purple patch his numbers are great but i think its a good point to make in general with fpl alon always comes to mind when he went on that crazy run of scoring like every week out of nowhere for like a month and then he very suddenly went back to the bad asset hes always been but i do recognize is more nuanced of harand cuz hes the most expensive player in fb history and isach and salah should outscore harland and rogers for example lets have a look at what the markets are saying this week projected goals by fixture and the clean sheet odds for gamei 11 graphic from rob t so looking at the projected goals tottenhams 29 is top of all the fixtures this week then its man united 245 liverpool 234 man city 205 so son and salanki look like awesome captains this week offering huge rank upside given the lower ownership as opposed to someone like salah and harland thats the fixure thats expected to have the most goals spurs are also top of the clean sheet odds as well theyve been given a 38 chance and then its man united liverpool and then its wolves west ham and man city tide im still in two minds about starting fabianski over rya though this suggests im about 4 likely to get a clean sheet which isnt a lot so if youre going to wild card in gic 12 over the theres some good one big punts on the table this week porro johnsons son sanki bruno p7 says that considering a free hit something along the lines of spurs players kya nori dow bruno and ask whats the best 11 this week this is just one mans view but id be reluctant to free hit in a single game week its so much stronger than the triple captainship which i think is more justifiable in a single game this season given that weve got two expected doubles as well this is the scout selection for gamei 11 they do a free hit team every week which comes from official fpl so lets try something new and look at that team and review it theyve got cells in goal v oldo 8 nor in defense salah palmer bruno and bumo midfield and then theyve got salanki kun wood up front its a pretty good team but if i was going to be free hitting i think id have son over palmer quite comfortably and id have pedro por over viio my gut feeling says that newcastle is going to be much harder fixture for forest so id also consider vis over wood as a onewe punt home to bournemouth lastly theres got to be some better goalkeeper picks for game mck 11 in isolation than sals anana kell and faki maybe let me know in the comments would you like the scout selection to be included in these every week moving forward or not interested last question and well move on panch asks is watkins a keep i do think an overlooked facet of villa this season is the immense challenge that comes with juggling the champions league and its new to pretty much the whole squad as well which could be why were seeing some results like a 41 loss to spurs and then a lost to club brugge midweek as well which their favorites to win its unbelievably hard to manage everyones fitness in the hardest possible schedule that said i look at villas games from game make 12 palace home chelse way brenford home southampton home three home games in four it doesnt seem like a rush to sell when youre on the cusp of some good fixtures the only player id consider selling him for is isach if youve got a bunch of transfers but thats a luxury move to me i might even buy watkins and get me 12 myself if i sell harland to emphasize that point on the fixtures watkins owners let us know in the comments are you keeping him or selling him right lets run through some of the news from todays press conferences then liverpool first so j remains sideline for a while slot said hes not going to train until one or two weeks after the international break so could be g 14 or 15 that he returns now allisons still out until after the break as well which we knew in case you missed it canate played in the champions league on tuesday after fears of an injury last weekend hes fine good news if youve got spurs assets posu says everyone came through the galatasaray game unscathed romeros got a chance of making game 11 hell be assessed wner mo vanen and richison all out he said the following about some we brought him back and in the first game he had a relapse what we dont want to do is put him back into that cycle again its very easy to do were managing his minutes and building him up he got a good 55 on the weekend and he got 45 last night hopefully we can build that up but ultimately its about getting him back and keeping him back so based on those remarks he might get around 75 minutes this game week lots of absentees of palace for their fixure against fulham could be good news if any youve got ral smith f or robinson even so and k has picked up a haming injury so he joins e warton and lura who are among those out injured plus will hughes is suspended for them maresco provided an update on palmer he said the following palmers getting better and we still have two days to prepare for the game hopefully we can have him for a session at least on saturday then we take a decision for the arsenal game chelsea versus nsal is the very last game of the gameing so its going to be a case of holding in him and hope he plays pep didnt have much to say at all his press conference he said greish is not available for saturdays game despite being called up by england he said he doesnt expect any returners this week so more or less the same squad that played in lisbon when they lost 41 to sport him savio started that one kb made the bench foden and harand vard and lewis also started final fb thoughts of my team then this is how line up for gami 11 ry vardo gabrielle pedro porro seeno palmer and bumo johnson wood kar and harand i keep going back and forth from fabianski and ryer as we as we saw earlier the bookies odds suggests that west ham are 4 likely to keep a clean sheet which is next to nothing so its still a coin toss i rate the arsenal defense so much higher but it is a tough game away chelsea theres big upside in double defense but i would be counting on the palmer blank so it occurred to me just this morning that if i was to go harand to strand lson and rogers to sah i have exact money to go johnson to sacker and get me 12 i somehow completely missed his path and im leaning towards doing it for minus 4 now it is quite risky cuz harlands massive ownership but salers probably would be even higher in terms of effective ownership but further to that id be exposed to international break price changes so if sacker was nearing a rise id have to go early on him as well its very tempting because then in gamei 12 id have a three premium midfield whereas if i was to roll and then make the moves in gamei 12 instead id be waiting till gami 14 to get sacka so a minus 4 gets me ahead of the curve id have to bench one of seeno wood if i do which isnt great probably have to be seeno would you be tempted to do it if you could get from johnson to sacker and gami 12 let me know in the comments pretty good depth on the bench this week with lewis and rogers if lewis starts anyway thanks for watching ive been working on a new stream intro which im going to use for the first time tomorrow you dont want to miss it well be live here around 900 am uk time see you all then,2352
13,FPLFocal,_6M23xLCggc,FPL GW11 EXPERTS TEAM 🚀 Gameweek 11,2024-11-07T12:09:07Z,welcome back for another video let's get straight into it for this week's experts video as we look at the Players the top managers in the world are buying and selling captaincy this week the experts team and all the rest so kicking the video off with the usual manager highlight honorable mentioned to last game X biggest score of 75 points which was FPL Spaceman at the top of the experts League ascar Bor is holding firm with an incredible overall rank with 3.7k after getting 60 points last game did you manage to beat the experts average score 51 they're gradually climbing the ranks now after a difficult start for many we've got 10 managers in the top 100K at the moment so what are they doing with their transfers this week then 45% are rolling the transfer 38% making one transfer 15% making two and just two are making three moves there's five experts in total taking a minus four hit this week to fix their teams up no chips active some have actually played an incredibly patient game with their transfers this season abdala is 300K and he's made the fewest transfers just for all season and he's sitting on five roll transfers as well with that rank easier said than done of course and you really have to nail your picks to get into the groove of rolling fair play if any of you have managed to bank four or five transfers so the big question is where is the game shifting this week who are they buying and selling I've made a new Improvement to this page which should make the data a bit more digestible all the players have now got positions by their name basically and at the very top this week it's K who 17% of bought which means Cal Leen unsurprisingly the most sold 23% of dropped him so many managers duped by that promise shown in game three and four when he got two goals and an assist he hasn't scored or assisted in six games since to add salt to the wound his non-penalty XG over those last six is higher than Woods he's got six goals in his last six 54.5% goal conversion over that run is highest in the league by wood as well however just 2% are actually buying wood this week it is Newcastle Arsenal IPS which are m city so there's only really two games that you'd feel happy about starting him in but if you got the rotation players then perhaps he works but beyond that the fixtures don't get much better very mixed CA really ticks all the boxes he's relatively cheap good underlying data and if we put up the fure tick all on f. page and sort by the next eight game Mi we sit top of the table for the best run of all games starting with Southampton home gami 11 so last week the Harland to Salah switch was a huge success are any experts going for it this week 8% of selling Harland 9% to buy and sah and there's one manager that's getting to Salah without selling Harland they're selling Trent and a which makes sense one of the hardest skills in FPL is timing it right when to hop on and off players like if you started this season without Harland and then you bought him after that ridiculous start they did the exact opposite of what you want to do there picking him when the form dropped off basically which no one saw coming let's be honest and you could argue luck plays a massive part there wasn't until gaming a that Salah and Palmer began moving ahead of points which begs the question is Harland really worth 15.3 mil another cheaper assets out scoring him 9% have opted for stran lson overa in some cases that's for Budget reasons Cal Le TOA requires 0.8 mil in the bank BR strand lson requires no extra money as he's only 5.6 mil so comparing their data side by side who's better K or stran Len well K's got 2.12 xgi to St lon's 1.77 K's taken 16 shots this season to his nine and he's created nine big chances to lson zero though lson does have a slightly better XG over the season so he's undeniably a solid pick and any trails K by four points currently the expectation which I think is fair is Kya will score more points longer term but you never know of FPL is it time to turn our attention to isach then starting to rise in popularity after three goals in the bounce in all competitions 8.3 mil is steep let's not forget last season he got 21 goals four assists he started 27 games fixtures ahead include West Ham home Leicester home and IP switch away the third most saw player is actually Rico Lewis who of course was benched last game week he started midweek in the champions leue Le while Walker was rested so many have called the security of his starts into serious question now as the next few games could suit Walker's Pace more so if we're being realistic of ourselves it would be a massive surprise if Lewis started all the next three eight nor is the most bought Defender 8% have picked him up some other Defenders here include D mesari Pedro por and vardal 6% of selling Rogers before the Liverpool game who did come off after a knock last gameing but he's fine he did start midweek in the Champions League Viller actually lost one nil to Club Brugge he played 66 minutes that match so just two managers have sold Robertson and if he still got him it could be time to get rid after his second bench in in four League games last weekend simic has been getting the starts ahead of him a is out injured till gamei 12 potentially so 4% have turned to seeno this week and as we saw bourn's second on the fixure ticker chart earlier and his 42 shots taken this season can only be beaten by harland's 48 moving on to captaincy then and it's probably the most divided it's been all season which is I guess exciting and SC bigger rank gains on the table this week if you get it right so we got exactly 50% on Salah who's top of the table and then it's 28% going for harand 9% sanii 7% Bruno 4% sun and then Palmer and bumma Captain by one each it has been a contrasting week for Salah and Harland Liverpool winning last weekend man city losing Salah with two assists as Liverpool went on to beat leusen 4-0 in the Champions League while man city fell to spor in 4-1 including a Miss penalty by Harlem is this the week harl City bounc back or is it time to cut our losses so with 9% going for sanki there's a genuine case to be made for him after that 16 points of last gameing home to whip switch as well in fact pulling up fpie projections after Salah who's on 7.2 points it is sanki in second with 6.5 sun is obviously subject to his minutes I've got him on 75 here as a best guess if he makes it to 80 minutes then he actually moves up to second place of course last game xon only played 55 minutes before coming off on his return from injury for them I can imagine the comments now after seeing 7% of Captain in Bruno but In fairness it's an incredible fixture home to Leicester I mean we've got to expect a bounce as well following ten hard's departure many players here could be fighting for their spot on the team as well so the likes of gatu could really sharpen a big way this week of course Bruno's nailed regardless In fairness Bruno's six projected points this week was just .1 behind Harland on FP review so I mean not. one is effectively just nois in the data so perhaps he is a shout for captaincy let us know in the your captain is going to be and why moving on to the experts team for game 11 and there been a big shake up to the team this week the team is fle and Tren 8 Nori Gabrielle bumo Palmer Salah Simo R kuna and sanki so Holland dropped out the team just barely and in comes Salah and fleen is also in a variah and Calbert Lun dropped out for CA as well nine home fixes in the team this week looking really well set up I've made some more improvements to this segment as well by the way the player list now has positions by every name as well so looking down that list salah's 65% owned Holland's 61% so it's very close but still barely enough for harand to drop out the team it might be the highest you've ever had a player on the list of a negative difference Holland 61% owned among the experts but 69% overall fleen just 4% ahead of r as well so that's a very close one but he's in the team now if you're not familiar with how this segment works the experts team is basically the 10 plate team so it's the 15 most owned players among the hundreds of managers that get involved in this series keeping it within budget If Money Was No Object then Harlem would be in over himz due to ownership but that's not happening this team's actually got about 3 mil on the bank as well which goes to show how much the money spreads around if you don't have Harland therefore it's Sal Captain this week and Salan Vice Pedro porro and V are the two other players with negative difference in the list here so in essence the overall player base likes them more than the experts do same for Holland hopefully like the new changes this week it takes more time to do but I think the data is more digestible this way and easier to use so that's going to be on every video moving forward make sure you're subscribed so final segment here's the experts final thoughts and tips for game 11 this is what they had to say this week Andrew NE sold Trent and E for Vandenberg and Salah and he says I've taken my first hit of the season and brought Salah in to protect my rank I've opted to go really light at the back to accommodate Salah harand and Palmer Morton Gams Edison says I think the big question this week is whether Man City are going through a blip we're January going to have a bad season I think the international breaks coming up at the perfect time for Pep he gives him a while to get key assets back from injury and working on stopping the rot conquer boners says I'll be hitting the Wilder button in gamei 12 so I've gone for two upside transfers in this week K and Pedro POR in for Watkins and celba as for Captain this week he's currently on Salah but I'm really tempted by big Dom salanki home to ipswitch he can't haul two weeks in a row can he Jason Flem says whilst harland's underlined data remains among the strongest in the League City look absolutely shock for confidence at the minute and Salah Palmer and Saka all look much more appealing captain the options in the coming weeks Harem may very well come good against Brighton this week but releasing the funds allow this ideal thre him in Midfield as well as my preferred team structure going forward Matt Brooks makes a valid point on selling Harland considering moving Harland on but the challenge will be once he's gone it's going to be very difficult to get him back at least until the second wild card so it will be a big call FPL Tony the Man City leaker himself is keeping Harland and he's actually captaining him as well as a Sal non-owner so I guess that's a bit reassuring and he says and my free transfer mini Wild Card coming after the international break and lastly hey FPL says errow

14,FPLFocal,LBfD3JbaaMU,MY FPL GW11 TEAM SELECTION | HAALAND OUT? ❌,2024-11-06T11:55:44Z,welcome back for another video I hope you all had a good gami 10 if not let's hope for a big gami 11 let's run through how the team's lining up this week and my TR for plans starting off with a quick review of how last game it went first 53 points all out which was enough for a green arrow up to 1 mil I mean if he'd offered me a green arrow with a harem blank and a Salah goal as a non-owner would have to take that fortunately viio Johnson Rogers wood and K all chipped in with returns that all said a disaster transfer as it played out it was two shots in three gamings for salanki so he left left the team ahead of what had potential to be another tough game against Villa and in came kuna it had to be the week sanki finally showed up with two goals and assist so well done if you had him Madison was dropped to the bench which did have a clear benefit to Spurs and sense of a better shape though he might go back to starting both K and Madison this week given it's an nip switch fixture seeno goal on the bench though he was never in consideration to start given the midfielders and fours I've have got but I'm glad to see him on the score shoot and avoid a fifth yellow card so LS of bench from Man City and it was Walker back in the 11s so he's become even more of a concern now not feeling as confident as minutes moving forward let's get into the team for gamei 11 and transfer plans a quick look at your FPL highs and lows sent in this week FPL hofburger says 29 Points on the bench absolute killer you had Rogers Davies and seeno all on the bench who all scored more bench pain n says it's fair to say I did not bench the right players this week we had salanki and Ana on the bench you combine for 31 points between them F pilson says deciding to be patient with sank and Johnson and also Savio the latter not getting minutes allowing Johnson to come in finish on a huge 77o game week Bambi says seeno bench I sold sanki I brought in R gimenez and I sold Rogers and bought gacho finished with 25 points last game week I mean gar Captain was pretty bold In fairness but yeah everyone blanked here very unlucky the lowest score in the top 10K last game it was 18 points not a single return here either including zero pointers from Martinez and daa one poters from eight Nory white Lis Diaz hav and Jackson Amaya says not complaining finished on 82 points which was a gameweek rank with 3.4k in the world absolute dream game week this must have been an insane Green Arrow and lastly Alice says luck continues very inspiring rank Gams here and quite a good reminder of what's possible in a short time if you get it right ranked 1.5 million in gami 5 now 664 in the world after gami 10 just five gemics later keep it up onto the team for make 11 them in goal I've actually got a rare choice to make between two keepers here fabianski is in the starting 11 currently given he's got the home fixture to Everton while Arsenal away to Chelsea he hasn't exactly impressed in the last couple of starts over arola though so we could see them swap back at any point have any of you got the Ryan fabianski combo if so who are you starting you could also make the case with fabianski if your second keeper someone like Hanson Martinez Sanchez or veran my backline this week is vardal Gabriel and Pedro porro so I've dropped Lewis to the bench so if this is a week where Lewis doesn't start I really need porry to finally deliver as he was basically bought his insurance against Lewis which so far hasn't yielded any benefit whatsoever with returns of 1 two two and one this was how man city lined up in the Champions League midweek a shocking 4-1 defeat to Amar sporting in his final home game for them Lewis started and right back and he did play 90 vardal phon and Harland also played 90 Spurs topped the clean sheet probabilities this week given a 42% chance man uniter and second Liverpool Third Man City fourth I don't even think Vel was immune from Pep rette himself but he's a safer pick than Lewis overall so I've started him pep might favor Walker's Pace with his upcoming games Brighton Spurs and Liverpool that all said I wasn't impressed by Walker last game Mick I feel like he had a bad game against Bournemouth despite City's defensive W vel's the second top scoring Defender with 49 points that's more than Johnson Bowen son K and havers only por has taken more than his 15 shots in fact so if I can find a way to make it work I'd like to keep him longterm still though I might need to move some money around in the coming weeks to accommodate sacka potentially Salah Gabrielle completes the backline though if there's some team needs of a Louis start I will be tempted to give him a start instead and Chase the maximum upside given I've got Palmer otherwise it'd be ATT attacko versus Defender Rya versus fabianski and Lewis versus Gabriel feels like one that could be a swingy outcome which I really want to get right this week and Arsenal clean sheet with Gabriel and Ry on the bench would be brutal so I could hedge with Gabrielle basically in mid field it's seeno Palmer and buo and Johnson seeno is back in the team in place of Rogers who's got Liverpool this game week he's taken 42 shots this season at a rate of 4.2 per game which only harand can beat with 48 he's looking like bourus Talis man now after San's departure and I'm glad I kept hold of him he rotates really nicely with Rogers and wood as well sano's away to brenford who still yet to give a clean sheet this season 20 goals conceded which is third worst behind wols and ipswitch so as an aumo owner let's hope for a goal Fest in this game he did have a quiet game against Fulham on the weekend he didn't register a single shot no chances created Fulham were all over them to be honest and it is a home fixure this week as braford looked to bounce back with a win so selling salanki was a bit of a disaster and it's an amazing effecture this week as well though at least I'm still sitting on double Spurs with por and Johnson Tottenham are top for expected goals this season with 20.13 Man City and Liverpool second and third it's going to be Johnson's last week in the team he's going to be leaving one way or another in gamei 12 before they're away to City so either be for Salah or sacka Arsenal actually way down in eight for expected goals here though a few red cards have skewed that a bit and obviously ard's been a huge miss the good news is ard's back in training so I'm still very interested in the Arsenal tag a parting gift from Johnson with one more return would be very welcome this week all in all he's been a successful transfer since coming in for Lis Diaz with two goals in four can he make it three and five so Palma's currently yellow flagged after a poor tackle from Martinez last game around his knee my initial thoughts were it's just a knock so I'm expecting him to be fine for game 11 personally Chelsea are really going to need him here they're tied on 18 points of Arsenal it's Fourth versus fifth big opportunity here to set three points between them I can't see myself selling him for a long time he's got to be a very long-term H with Chelsea's fixtures he's a very strong shout for the best captain in Game 12 though Salah against Southampton is also a shout up front it's wood Kya and Harland I'm going to need a Kya brace and a slanky blank to claw back some lost points so I think I'm going to have to write K off as a bad transfer made slightly too soon with hind so richardon has picked up an injury again as well so salanki is nailed on he might even get 90 minutes this is a must-win game for wolves they're bottom of the Premier League table one point behind Southampton and the win could take them straight out of the relegation Zone just 1.37 projected goals in the not the forest versus Newcastle fixture this graphic from 11 to5 K would keep his run of goals going though only harland's got more than his eight goals scored this season and bum's also got eight I'm waiting up whether wood could be a sell after the IP switch fixture when the got City in fact in bumo as well from g 14 when his fix is also turn I think it could be an opportunity to bank the profit on these guys and pivot to some other assets of better fixtures for example I could go and bumo to sacker and gamei four team and there's the likes of Welbeck Jackson Watkins eak all great upcoming fixtures as a possible wood replacement later so that brings me to harand then I'm not feeling comfortable about captaincy this week m city are out of form in fact they've just lost three games on the bounce in all competitions for the first time in six years injuries to important players and Harland out form with one goal in his last five League games a Miss penalty in the Champions League as well I very nearly Captain Palmer last game week but in the end both blanked anyway so no difference there I've only got one free transfer and I just can't bring myself to minus four Harland out to Salah although that would have worked out last game we it also means selling Rogers and benching wood or seeno one of the few positives from the Champions League was de bry's return he came off the bench and if he's pass fit enough to start the next gameing that' be a huge boost to their attack though he's opening five game Mi he's certainly lived up to the 1550 mil price tag but when he's scoring one and five for over 15 mil such a huge waste of money and you've got Salah and Palmer putting up more points for cheaper over the last five game the craziest part is he's top in the league for non penalty expected goal of them with 4.14 salz is less than half that needs to find his finishing boots Pep's one of the best in the game at finding solutions to difficult situations can he bounce back this week and more importantly for my team can Harlem bounce back on the bench it's Ry Lewis Rogers and Greaves so I've got 1.6 mil on the bank got one free transfer I don't think it's worth taking the minus four to sell harand for seller but that could be a mistake So the plan as it stands is to roll the transfer so this will take me to two pre- transfers taken into the international break and then I'll have the option to buy Sal for harand for free instead in gamei 12 so to quickly run through gamei 12 pulling up plan FPL these are the two paths I'm considering the first option in Game 12 is harand to eak and Johnson to Salah isak's home to West time that week obviously have been a really ropey defense and he's got great long-term fixtures and he starting to show some form so I quite like that route of isach i' would have to delay getting sacka to game 14 though which should probably be in boomo to sacka and inario down to a 4.6 mil Defender like cwell the other option for gami 12 is Johnson to sacka and then completely move off man City's defense by going Lewis to vardo and dunk to coell now that would be a minus four here but it does get me straight to three premiums quicker however I would be Bank on Harem match and until gimick 15 which have to make the switch such as harand to isak and aumo to Salah I'm undecided at the moment but fortunately I've got plenty of time to think it over so I'm not going to do it this week I mean harand won't keep blanking forever things change fast in FPL like if it was the hall against Brighton there sudden it's tempting to keep him and just add sacka to get to three premiums in gamei 12 and then delay Sal till gamei 15 so that's where I'm currently at thanks for watching hit subscribe for more FPL content like this to come before the deadline see you soon for the next one,2253,welcome back for another video i hope you all had a good gami 10 if not lets hope for a big gami 11 lets run through how the teams lining up this week and my tr for plans starting off with a quick review of how last game it went first 53 points all out which was enough for a green arrow up to 1 mil if hed offered me a green arrow with a harem blank and a salah goal as a nonowner would have to take that fortunately viio johnson rogers wood and k all chipped in with returns that all said a disaster transfer as it played out it was two shots in three gamings for salanki so he left the team ahead of what had potential to be another tough game against villa and in came kuna it had to be the week sanki finally showed up with two goals and assist so well done if you had him madison was dropped to the bench which did have a clear benefit to spurs and sense of a better shape though he might go back to starting both k and madison this week given its an nip switch fixture seeno goal on the bench though he was never in consideration to start given the midfielders and fours ive have got but im glad to see him on the score shoot and avoid a fifth yellow card so ls of bench from man city and it was walker back in the 11s so hes become even more of a concern now not feeling as confident as minutes moving forward lets get into the team for gamei 11 and transfer plans a quick look at your fpl highs and lows sent in this week fpl hofburger says 29 points on the bench absolute killer you had rogers davies and seeno all on the bench who all scored more bench pain n says its fair to say i did not bench the right players this week we had salanki and ana on the bench you combine for 31 points between them f pilson says deciding to be patient with sank and johnson and also savio the latter not getting minutes allowing johnson to come in finish on a huge 77o game week bambi says seeno bench i sold sanki i brought in r gimenez and i sold rogers and bought gacho finished with 25 points last game week gar captain was pretty bold in fairness but everyone blanked here very unlucky the lowest score in the top 10k last game it was 18 points not a single return here either including zero pointers from martinez and daa one poters from eight nory white lis diaz hav and jackson amaya says not complaining finished on 82 points which was a gw rank with 34k in the world absolute dream game week this must have been an insane green arrow and lastly alice says luck continues very inspiring rank gams here and quite a good reminder of whats possible in a short time if you get it right ranked 15m in gami 5 now 664 in the world after gami 10 just five gemics later keep it up onto the team for make 11 them in goal ive got a rare choice to make between two keepers here fabianski is in the starting 11 currently given hes got the home fixture to everton while arsenal away to chelsea he hasnt exactly impressed in the last couple of starts over arola though so we could see them swap back at any point have any of you got the ryan fabianski combo if so who are you starting you could also make the case with fabianski if your second keeper someone like hanson martinez sanchez or veran my backline this week is vardal gabriel and pedro porro so ive dropped lewis to the bench so if this is a week where lewis doesnt start i need porry to finally deliver as he was bought his insurance against lewis which so far hasnt yielded any benefit whatsoever with returns of 1 two and one this was how man city lined up in the champions league midweek a shocking 41 defeat to amar sporting in his final home game for them lewis started and right back and he did play 90 vardal phon and harland also played 90 spurs topped the clean sheet probabilities this week given a 42 chance man uniter and second liverpool third man city fourth i dont even think vel was immune from pep rette himself but hes a safer pick than lewis overall so ive started him pep might favor walkers pace with his upcoming games brighton spurs and liverpool that all said i wasnt impressed by walker last game mick i feel like he had a bad game against bournemouth despite citys defensive w vels the second top scoring defender with 49 points thats more than johnson bowen son k and havers only por has taken more than his 15 shots in fact so if i can find a way to make it work id like to keep him longterm still though i might need to move some money around in the coming weeks to accommodate sacka potentially salah gabrielle completes the backline though if theres some team needs of a louis start i will be tempted to give him a start instead and chase the maximum upside given ive got palmer otherwise itd be att attacko versus defender rya versus fabianski and lewis versus gabriel feels like one that could be a swingy outcome which i want to get right this week and arsenal clean sheet with gabriel and ry on the bench would be brutal so i could hedge with gabrielle in mid field its seeno palmer and buo and johnson seeno is back in the team in place of rogers whos got liverpool this game week hes taken 42 shots this season at a rate of 42 per game which only harand can beat with 48 hes looking like bourus talis man now after sans departure and im glad i kept hold of him he rotates nicely with rogers and wood as well sanos away to brenford who still yet to give a clean sheet this season 20 goals conceded which is third worst behind wols and ipswitch so as an aumo owner lets hope for a goal fest in this game he did have a quiet game against fulham on the weekend he didnt register a single shot no chances created fulham were all over them to be honest and it is a home fixure this week as braford looked to bounce back with a win so selling salanki was a bit of a disaster and its an amazing effecture this week as well though at least im still sitting on double spurs with por and johnson tottenham are top for expected goals this season with 2013 man city and liverpool second and third its going to be johnsons last week in the team hes going to be leaving one way or another in gamei 12 before theyre away to city so either be for salah or sacka arsenal way down in eight for expected goals here though a few red cards have skewed that a bit and ards been a huge miss the good news is ards back in training so im still very interested in the arsenal tag a

my voice heard okay all right yeah get out there and vote everybody get make your voice make your voice heard vot yeah the one basic civic duty that you can do and and you know if nothing else literally the least you can do yeah I don't know about you by the way I'm getting uh I cannot stop getting texts like even when I like even when I'm like blocking or like listen I I think you can support a a political party without wanting to get an email the increasingly desperate email right it's like pathetic it's like we're gonna we're all gonna die if you don't get eight you know and then it's like oh yeah but also we have so much money that we're gonna like rent out the sphere so I'm like I don't like how do I Square all this like like how much does it cost to rent the sphere up that's got to be 20 million or something but it seems expensive for sure we should run out the sphere if we ever do cheaters Las Vegas if we ever go to the that's true if we ever go back to the to win you know we need to do the Pod from the sphar that is true actually we haven't uh I haven't heard anything about podcasts uh being broadcast at the spere I I I think an always a an English Premier League fantasy podcast would be an incredible uh forget call her daddy or whatever heard forget forget Joseph rogo winsky you know like no no uh all right let's do it let's do a clean start here Brandon for real all right hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is Josh I'm here with Brandon Brandon how are you I'm all right Josh slow you know I'm a little worried because it's it's you know we have we fell back Brandon we in America this this you know last night was our fallback so for us we're actually recording this uh after nine I mean it's eight o'clock on the on the you know on the the official clock Brandon but my my body clock is telling me that it's 9:08 p.m. right now so see see how we how you know what our stamina is like the even go on here I don't know if I'm feeling tired because we uh we think it's later than it is or if I'm feeling tired just watching my rank remain exactly the same every week yeah I sort of um I've caught up with you uh but well you I mean okay like I guess let's just get it right into it then shall we you know because I think I yeah I think you want we we fell back into our classic patterns uh this week uh for for good or for ill I have been I have been aggressive this season and uh it has backfired sometimes and it has worked out sometimes right and it's sort of like uh they've sort of they've kind of neutralized like depending on like where this week ends up I'm I'm probably gonna be at my highest rank since gameweek three and that was right when I decided to take it make an ultra aggressive Wild Card Brandon Wild Card had a lot of high performers for a lot of low performers right it it seemed like a good idea at the time uh and uh so I've sort of you know like I'm like Jerry BR I've come out in the middle somehow here so you know you are now like you know it's been seven weeks since then where how are you feeling you feel like you're kind of stuck in place after uh 11 it's not over yet there's still one I do feel stuck I can certainly easily pinpoint what the problem has been it was really I've lost two weeks to Phil foden and remember we did a patreon pod before like the game week nine deadline and I was contemp in uh Chris Wood and guardal in or I ended up going with moleno and Phil foda which you did on the pod in real time like I maybe that's a dangerous game right there is the the real time transfer I don't know if you you know maybe you maybe you were concerned about Radiance Brandon and it was it was a you know it was like a a season ending Cliff I will sacrifice my overall rank to get those numbers up for sure now I I don't think it was a bad idea at the time time I mean foden was certainly coming back into the City squad City it cuts both ways like foden space became more secure because of injuries and City's form became has become quite poor because in Man City we're about to play Southampton at home right going into game week nine like it's not I don't think you have to retroactively uh bang your head against the wall too much he also had a very good match in gameweek nine um but better I think in nine than in 10 I I I haven't looked at his like the underlying performance uh from foden it was was one of I was I was watching multiple matches on Sunday I saw him miss a pretty good chance I feel like it was in the first half but I I I assume you were watching more closely than me so what did you think about foden well yeah I mean he was fine yes he didn't have as many clear-cut opportunities for fantasy points than he did against Southampton and City just they they looked worse this week certainly they could not really create any big chances and what chances they made Holland Chief among them it just really couldn't finish them at all Holland was was quite poor now I don't want to get too like morose about that transfer two weeks ago because there is always a ripple effect over the course of a month plus and so what I what where I'm at right now with the foden move is uh if if I had done the gardial wood move a couple weeks ago I would be in incredible shape right now because guardo's hit in those two weeks as his W however I wouldn't be in a position to for free this week get uh triple premium so now I'm just totally enamored of the triple premium and I would have I if I I have already done hovers to Wood uh and now I can for free on exact money do uh fod in to Palmer and so now I can like I'm in that I'm heading into that gameweek WI transfer window of just like looking at awe in awe at my team which is honestly never where you want to be because that's usually when when things kind of goly but but just to finish that point I wouldn't be able to get pmer right now if I had done those other moves so it's an interesting fantasy conundrum of would you trade those points for the last two weeks to get your optimal team at the moment well and we're about to be I you know I'm glad you brought up the um the premium situation because I think that was really you know if there was like a kind of big talking point in in fantasy this week um and one that I think I kind of came to late I was a little reluctant to embrace it and it was it was do we just kind of give up on Holland at the moment like is there enough kind of chaos at Man City with all of the injuries we sort of joked on the patreon Pol last week about Pep's really grumpy press conference right where he was like I don't know everyone's on the everyone's getting a massage right now they're all you know on the train whatever I've got nine players or whatever this like once a year pep has like a a press conference like this right where he's like we have no money we have no you know it's a sort of like he can't help it right but I it's fine we all you wonder though I mean it it is positive that that's peps actually he's communicating to his team in that moment of like I'm I see what's going on here and I'm even going to communicate through the press to you that like get it together you it's not that I guess so but to me it's like it feels like more defeatist than that right it's kind of like I don't know like we'll see if we can scratch out a point this weekend with with our with our Mash unit you know so and and and they and they didn't uh they they got semano which was uh pretty awesome I mean I have been in the Antoine seano fan club for uh well I mean I don't know for a year right like it has not been for multiple Seasons but going back to last season I thought he was he was fantastic he sort of um lost a little bit of um I feel like he didn't really have the spotlight last year because he was sort of in a um sort of complimentary role to Dominic salanki who who also had a great season for Bournemouth uh but Sano was just this this rightwing who was just kind of making all sorts of things happen down the stretch for for Bournemouth last season and even with uh sank Gan and Evan Nelson coming in he he's still doing that and I it's sort of interesting because uh you know it's I don't know it's like I I don't really know if I'm going to he may not even in my team uh because there are actually so many uh sort of cheap midfielders and I have to kind of decide between him and Morgan Rogers I think if if I'm GNA go with the with the thrum uh the thrum approach which I'm leaning towards as well by the way uh but you know at the moment um I don't know I I you know there's a couple of injuries too we've got like you know Palmer is flagged now and Morgan Rogers is flagged and we need to see where these guys are um over the next couple days they both should be fine I mean Morgan Rogers it was like it was like I I couldn't tell if he just got kicked one too many times right because he went down once right like right around the 60th minute I remember because I was like watching the CL I I was I did you start Rogers this week as well I did yeah yeah yeah so I I was like watching the clock I'm like wait is he going off here too because it was like 5940 when he was on the ground and then he went down a second time and that's when they took him off about 10 minutes later so I I think he's probably fine it's like the classic knock right um contact injury yeah and I didn't even see what happened with Palmer um nor I played the full 90 played the full 90 but now he's he's got a flag on the site too so we'll see what what the deal is there it could be one of these like Chris Wood style injuries right where Chris Wood um it was like it seemed like he was GNA be fine and he was right like in general there's like there's there really are two kinds of 75% Flags right there's the like seems like they're fine should be fine and the 75% flag that's really more like zero out for six months man yeah or like yeah exactly like e like e was was 75 exactly like yeah they were 75% until the manager definitively came out and said that they were I don't know you like never see a 50% flag anymore I feel like you know like it's yeah it's like 50% and 25% like those it's poiz it's our polarized climate now Josh it's it's everything's very black and white either you're on one side or the other either injured or you're not yeah interesting you think there's flag hurting going on like this pole hurting I keep they want everything to be 75% yeah maybe so uh but anyway just to get back to the premium thing for a second because I think it really was interesting uh the question was basically um I think for a lot of us we were debating between Salah and Holland you had Sala already so it was a little easier for you to just sort of stick with with Holland I would have done the same thing if I had um if I had Holland uh but not having Sala and and wanting to sort of long-term make this move to have three premiums and if you want to sort of get into that we talked about it for like a half hour on last week's pod right so we don't think we need to rehash it go through all of it again but I think basically the idea is that it does seem like virtually every week there's going to be um three out of four of these guys are going to you know deliver interestingly this was the week where it was just one right it was yeah just just Salah and if you uh had Salah and you Captain him he just got nine points which isn't that much but nine points you know with a blank feels huge right and so I think that was really I I I don't think many people have no s over Holland I mean it's possible but I think um most people have one of the two and so you saw I think a big contrast in returns and if you just had Salon Captain him that was probably enough for you to be in a gray or green arrow uh you and I actually both have I believe three players in the Monday match right um yeah right yeah I have Smith row you have rul and then uh we both have Momo and Robinson so I guess we're we're rooting for mass chaos in the Monday night fixture yeah I forget who did you bench to uh to bring you started uh G or um uh you started um your did you who did you bench that you could start your full in midfielder yeah I ended up benching Liam deap so that I could start Emil Smith row so you know when we talked on Thursday night with her patreon supporters my thought was well the Lester fixture is is choice that's like that's grade a beef for Le and deap and the more I just thought about it the more uh like my my real uh just like confidence in IP switch is like fully waning and I just decided to trust that and then also go for the fun of having as many players as possible in the final fixture of of the game we and also like roll with my Fen boys so yep uh obviously I'm thrilled that I made that choice and then I had consa the other choice I had to make this weekend was Kana or Pedro poro in my defense and I opted to bench Kaa and then Villa are first to score and I think yet again I've blown it but you know I W I won in the end Josh one point from poro instead of Zero from Kaa so I take that as a win I know that's always the L like when you when the Kaa thing was like when that late goal and you're like well who does that really help you know I mean obviously salanki owners but then it was like well it hurts the con of St they lose they lose extra point from that so um yeah I think it was really interesting weekend so what I ultimately ended up doing and I'll I'll share my team here just that we can we can talk through it a little bit um is uh I did end up making the move um it's funny I actually went on uh I I went and and and kind of like apologized on um on our Discord because I was like listen I didn't talk about this move at all uh you know on last night's pod where we talked about our moves for a half hour because just really was extremely reluctant to part ways with Holland and I I ultimately decided it was worthwhile to do it um just because um I I you it was kind of the only way I could get to Saka as well right and so I'm sort of thinking it was like a move that was sort of made with gameweek 12 in mind right which is when the fixers finally get a little bit better for um for Arsenal and I think for you it's it's a little different because you still have a wild card to play right and so for you you don't be thinking long term and it's it's so funny I'm like setting myself up for all of these like perfect moves meanwhile I have a wild card where I could just do it whenever I wanted yeah what is are you thinking you might just yeah you might just use it like uh you might just hold off and uh listen I just like to sometimes I like to flex and uh Hey listen I put it in the comments if you want to see Brandon not play his uh wild card I want to hear from you yeah so I am uh I'm on 48 on the week so far and um yeah it's you know it's I so I brought in gardial and that has worked out extremely well because I was debating between guio and Lewis and you could certainly make it a the the case for Lewis is basically that he's you know 1.3 million cheaper and uh uh you know felt like he was fairly locked into the squad but uh not so fast right Kyle Walker comes back in uh gets the uh Captain's armband uh the real life one not the fantasy one uh and and then to make things even worse Rico Lewis comes on as the late sub right so you're sort of getting the like the nightmare scenario uh for you know if you're a Lewis owner um whereas vardal gets uh clean sheet and three bonus last week and then uh scores a goal he like didn't even celebrate the goal like that was it was the classic like I don't even know like I guess I guess this is good you know because they were they were down two-nil and he wanted to you keep it rolling it's a he's a soldier of fortune he's just out there to do a job and make sure like a hessan troop in the Revolutionary War Brandon I like it yeah so he's a oh I like that let's start calling gardial the hessen on this PO you know moving forward for it yeah so uh gardial and um so but I did I dropped uh Holland for Raul um I I considered salanki that was the sort of algo recommended move and Brandon score one for the alos because uh in the first in the first half of that Spurs match I was like yeah see no salani this is like you know this this is this is smart this is wise like us managers yeah exactly humans went again I'm watching these games okay I know not to get salanki uh you know like smash cut to the end of the match where he's got two goals and an assist uh and looked looked great too like uh totally completely different player um and he ends up up in 16 points so r no pressure tomorrow uh just outscore Dominic sanki 16 points and will be good um but yeah so Rogers came through that with nine Jamie vardy who low-key has actually been fine like totally fine as a as a as my cheap forward um I got five points for him this week a really nice assist actually too in the IU goal um and Jordan iio by the way just hanging around like he's he's gonna be like uh Danny wellb back just 17 seasons in he's still going to be getting getting minutes you know for these squads uh not starter anymore but he can like you know he can come he can come in and do a job like this is you know his second uh sub appearance goal in two matches so uh so yeah but I got a a an assist from B got a goal and two bonus last week and a goal the week before that so um you perfectly respectable returns for for a sub6 million forward um and uh yeah Watkins blanks and I think that's really you know looking ahead to gameweek 11 I think that's really where my brain is and I have to say Brandon I did not think I'd be doing this on the pop but I also didn't think I'd be dropping Holland uh last week so uh Watkins to Dominic salani looms as a possible gameweek 11 transfer what's your uh you know Watkins is about to price drop in the next hour while we do you have you have room wiggle room there yeah he rose in price after I bought him so he's at N I bought him at nine he's at 91 now so it would just you know it wouldn't matter um and uh so Watkins to Salan um Spurs play if switch uh in gameweek 11 makes some logical sense I'd like to wait a couple of days to do it if I could because uh uh they do have a Europa League match on Thursday so ideally I would I would wait until after that we'll see how the price changes you know I i' would probably take one point1 change like another one on the chin uh I don't know if I'd take two right and so and so but I think that would feel like a fairly logical move I also have because I made this Holland switch um and BR andala it actually freed up like something like three million if I do Watkins to salani that would give me enough Mo enough money to move either Sano or Rogers to Saka in gameweek 12 okay so so it kind of like the moves almost kind of pick themselves I feel like right I mean you know barring any serious injuries I think that feels like a pretty logical move for gameweek 11 it's just boom Watkins to salani right target tot home match great fixture and the the fixtures coming up for Spurs 2 are really enticing some people will be thrown off by the Man City away fixture in game week 12 but you know they've got two home fixtures with IP switch and fullam on either side yeah followed by Bourn myth like a salony return home you know that's just got narrative written all over it yeah that's true it's like it could go could go either way right it's like uh a non- celebration I feel like no matter what right and then the two F the two tough matches following that uh Chelsea and then Li poool with Southampton those two tough matches are both at home for Spurs so I feel like they're going to take a ton of Confidence from this Villa result this weekend you know after like going through a rough patch feels like a good time to have Spurs assets yeah and what do you I mean I know neither of us have been and I should say we have not been super high on Spurs salani I think you and I were both big fans of Bournemouth Salan sure right and so it just hasn't quite he hadn't quite clicked for for Spurs had some injuries uh also hadn't really shown um a particularly high ceiling right uh for for Spurs so far and um uh does one half kind of wipe all that away like you know what do you think about sank now after this match I don't I mean how could it it can't possibly like what we've seen of solanki at Spurs beyond that one half has been Mr back to goal uh scarce scant chances but it could just be as simple as playing you know more it expansive uh ambitious team like Aston Villa to open up the Play a little bit more yeah there was a little bit more space on the wings and and that just really favored salanki so it just he could just be a fixture player uh perhaps but um you know just looking at the way managers are jumping having held kept the faith with salanki he's absolutely an asset to continue Keeping the Faith with just given like if it's working for Spurs it's work a lot and his ceiling is like so I think what we discovered this weekend is sani's ceiling is a lot higher than we would have thought and it's it's still unclear what his floor is yeah and I think it's it's his price is low enough that you don't have to move everything right you don't have to completely shift your team around to bring him in and so I do think he's um I hate to be like the prisoner of the moment like this but I don't know when a when a forward scores a brace and has one of the worst defenses at home in the next match it's those moves are pretty simple sometimes right um like you don't have to overthink it too much and then the question is really just do you wait until Friday to make the move or you just go ahead and and pull the trigger early so um did you say you already made your moves for game week 11 well I I did not make a transfer heading into this weekend so I have two free and I've already moved HTS to Wood because I have exact money to do this move to do harberts to Wood and foden to Cole Palmer okay so I've done one half of it to catch the chriswood price rise and now I have 0.1 to give on foden but I can't okay uh manage a price her as on Palmer so I'm just watching that and I will there's there's no real sense of me waiting too long if there's news about Palmer's Fitness and of course uh BB in the YouTube chat made a good point it was is that Martinez challenge at the end of the Manchester United match where he caught Cole Palmer on the knee and um oh he's fine then so he like played the rest I mean he like had a chance uh shortly after that so I I think it's fine right so there there's really no reason for me to hold off because Cole Palmer won't be playing midweek because he's not on the the the Chelsea team sheet for for Europa just yet so anyway um those I mean what is Phil foden gonna do in the Champions League to make me be like wow I've got a hold him I seeing de bruyne on the bench for Man City with like foden's got to go like immediately now I don't even know if he's even going to play nor is there any reason to keep him and an Arsenal fixture for Chelsea uh obviously it's tough Arsenal have a good defense but what a great time to play Arsenal like arsenal were like in like severe I don't want to be around anymore mode yeah this weekend and I think Cole Palmer just he clearly doesn't care who he's playing I think he's playing really well you know he had a kind of a downbeat match against Manchester United but um it ended up being a tricky match I think just because of the uh the manager change right I think um uh I the United players were up for it for sure they were up for it exactly and I think that that changed things a little bit he had um I guess he could have had an assist right um so yeah it just it wasn't quite his day but I I think that that match for me I I traditionally think of that especially I don't know seems like especially when man united host Chelsea that match always I know it's like the most they were saying uh today that in the today's broadcast that it's the most drawn match in the Premier League and that kind of squares up with my own memory it does feel like every time man man united host Chelsea it is like a one-1 or nil-nil Draw and I'm I'm not quite sure why that is but let's yeah let's let's let's go back uh just for a moment to the beginning of gameweek 10 because Arsenal did stumble again they played away to Newcastle Newcastle probably played their strongest match of the season so far um and yeah another tough match for all Arsenal assets right you hovers uh with a one-pointer socka blanked um defense uh concedes a goal I think it was like the 12th or 15th minute I can't what ESO scored fairly early in the game and um and then that was kind of it right it was sort of um um I don't know like I I just like it's a TR I I still feel like it's going to turn around like I you know and I I I mean I at this point I guess I'm almost thinking more like in terms of fantasy results than I am like the actual team like I we got our old Arsenal back Josh where they're playing for fourth place again and we love it such a no I don't love it I I actually hate it uh however yeah I mean who would have thought like the story this this season was going to be like I to me it was like Arsenal are finally there like they're finally gonna push through and and then like Liverpool are sort of like the oh not so fast like maybe we'll just steal this title and uh but you know with Man City losing today um it actually like it's it's very open still clearly right like it's it's it's I actually kind of in my head I thought that man city had already lost I I sort of was surprised um when I read that it was their first loss of the Season like they just had a couple of you know I guess they've had these like really um the draw with Arsenal the the late win over have we been so have we been so warped by like the last fiveish years where you can only win the te title if you're basically undefeated like there were you know Barclays the the Barclays era of the Premier League has been in the air this season let's go back where you can lose like five matches and still win the title that's exciting that's cool I I think it's cool too like I I hope we have a three-way or or more race I think that would be awesome uh the other cool story uh was uh there were actually a couple questions too about Forest uh but but forest in third place which I think is so cool like it's I think it's really um it's just fun like even kind of fantasy aside it's it's just always like every year there's kind of one team like last year it was Villa right and I I don't know that I genuinely think that Forest could get a Champions League spot but I think that they're they could they sneak into like a Europa League spot maybe I mean they have a they have a strong defense um they have some you know Callum Hudson they have players like Callum Hudson M doy who like are like highly pedigreed players right who've battled sort of injury and for I mean there was a time a few years ago I don't remember this when when Chelsea were basically fending off Bayern Munich who were making a big push for for Callum Hudson M so uh then he kind of had this like you know it was like he was trying to get into that break into that Squad and like I was like oh like let's make him uh left wing back Hudson adoi right it was like they were sort of like trying everything to make it work and and I just wonder if that kind of screw with him a little bit it's like a you know it's like a like a baseball hitter who they're like oh like you should change your swing right so that you can uh hit more home runs like change your launch angle right and then suddenly it's like they can't they can't do anything anymore and I just wonder and last year he battled injuries on and off too uh you know what you know what also screws with your confidence when your Club buys 20 other left Wingers right exactly oh my God and I thought Enzo was bad today also Enzo I don't know what it's like the way he color like his haircut now he looks like Cole Palmer on the pitch it's really annoying to me like I was uh trying to like maybe my TV just isn't big enough Fernandez looks no I don't in general no Cole Palmer is possibly the most distinctive looking person in the Premier League but for some reason when they were on the pitch today there were like three or four times when I thought that I thought it was Cole Palmer and then I was like oh that's Enzo uh with the ball so I think he I think he's he got like a different haircut or something um so yeah you thinking of the right like like Enzo Fernandez came on like as a substitute very La late in the match um who knows does he have blonde hair now I am I am I like totally wrong about this I'm going to do a Google image search for the last 24 hours I genuinely can't are you confusing him with rasmus's holand perhaps no I'm not I don't know you know we we'll solve this mystery maybe who maybe I thinking of somebody else I don't know like little uh I'm gonna do some di Baff yeah we'll find we'll figure this out so um yeah but on Forest I mean yeah so you brought in Chris Wood yeah um ana who you've been like he I know I joke often say this but like he kind of is your boy this season like you've been you've been big uping him all year and so he uh he gets the goal I think he ended up with three bonus points as well in the match so uh I mean their defense looks strong Midfield I don't know I mean uh you know Morgan Gibs White's in battling some injuries and so it's kind of hard to recommend him but Hudson adoy has sneakily been pretty good uh this season and um let me see just just let me pull him up real quick here um as we're as we're talking um yeah he he's now the top midfielder um uh for Forest he's got uh I mean I guess it's just it's just two goals and one assist so it's not like you know mind-blowing but um uh I don't know I I I just feel like like the way they're clicking right now there there might be some interesting uh options there I maybe it's it honestly might just be wood wood and Anar are the only two you really want to consider although sells as a as a as a cheap uh keeper like if I could go back and do my wild card again and in fact when you wild card Brandon I think Sals would have to be someone you'd consider right 4 million um I'll take anyone like it's basically the first goalkeeper to get in line like you know you play that game when you're a kid like you know last one to get get to your knee or something like that is it right yeah you know first goalkeeper to touch and knee is my go keeper I mean he's got uh he's racked up an assist so far this season uh he's got uh four clean sheets uh let's see he's got six bonus points I mean he honestly he's probably been one of the one of the better cheap Keepers that you could have this year seon um so yeah I'm up on Forest I'm rooting for them I also like their red color Brandon I maybe just like red squads you know but I I think aesthetically they're like a fun Squad like they're fun Squad to watch in this year yeah I think in general I actually like to watch most of the teams in the Premier League this year like outside of Southampton um I feel like uh I mean the thing about Lester like in you know it's like you're talking about like benching dap for that match and I I I do kind of get it because they're not exactly pushing overs like they don't they concede goals but like every match they play is like so unpredictable it's like you really don't know it's a little bit like what you that feeling you get when you're in a FPL head-to-head league and you have to play average that week I feel like when you play Lester this season it's like going against the FPL average yeah you're like I should win this like but I don't know I don't know and I'm going to lose more than I expect so yeah so I think um I don't know I think that like they're they're they're an interesting team I'm actually just gonna hold vardy by the way for a while like I don't I don't see any reason to like I mean if I could make an easy move to to wood at some point I'll do it but otherwise like how much does cost these days he's like 5.6 something like that I mean nothing right so um you know I I wouldn't even necessarily recommend buying him like they play away to man united in game we 11 but um all right so like I'm just moving through my little uh my talking points for today's match Brandon um what did you think about gardial by the way 6.2 million so he's very pricey um in general we have not been getting a lot from Keepers this season uh but bonus in the last match goal I mean there's something about the the left back spot for Man City it does seem to be a spot where um I think maybe especially with Kyle Walker when he plays right because he's so strong defensively um that maybe that it's a spot where you could get a little bit more I mean like he to me he's probably the second and maybe honestly the only the the one other player you can have on man city right now uh outside of outside of Holland right I mean it's it's kind of a mess otherwise it is he's a strange fantasy ass head guardio because you really are relying on him getting attacking returns because uh I I thought he had a really poor defensive match and just City obviously nothing needs to be said beyond they've been horrible defensively all season um but he but he has this pension for popping up and getting attacking returns yeah and it's like how much are you willing to spend because he doesn't get attacking Returns the way a lot of fullbacks do like the Trent Trent Alexander Arnolds of of the world like he's never he's I don't think I've ever seen vardal cross the ball um but he's certainly looking to get on the end of a onew or on the AC cross so I like him right he's more of a goalscoring fullback than a like like he's not he's not um Andy Robertson right he's got like a very different kind of he's a Sheamus Coleman we could say he's he's more he's he's more a Sheamus Coleman than a Leighton Baines okay yeah yeah well yeah if he was on pens maybe he could be a he could be a well why not why not why not so let's see he's got uh on the season safar's G got three goals and no assists um those three goals have come in the last five matches so he's kind of I mean like I don't know I really don't know like I you know statistically I don't know how to like um talk about streakiness or whatever but he has been a very streaky asset in fantasy we saw this last season as well right where he um put in a lot of good performan like he he passed the eye test right like when you watched him in these Man City matches it was like w this guy is like all over the ball he's you know getting hugely Advanced positions like and and you know but but he also had this run of 10 plus matches or something like that like last season where he just got no attacking returns right just nothing and he was you know kind of expensive uh and this season kind of the same way the first five weeks of the Season no goals and no assists uh and now he's got three goals in his last five uh with a u a clean sheet and three bonus thrown in as well right and the three bonus comes at least a little bit from the threat that he was providing right on the the like you said I I don't uh I much like Trent I I'm rarely impressed with his uh defensive capab it was weird in the Liverpool match there was some moment where Trent like gave the ball away in a bad spot and the announcers were like unusual for Trent I was like I don't think so that's what you pay for yeah yeah so I think with guardio he's the kind of fantasy asset that you kind of stumble backwards into uh like in just in the right game week it feels right and you go for it I can't see any like grander plan involving guardal like why you would like he would be a part of a team you were you were constructing over the course of of a month that that sort of a thing because I think where we're at right now is like trying to get as much extract as much money out of our defense as possible because there's no real value there I mean now you have you have and Trent at this point uh what's the deal there it's not going to last um and uh but I think at the moment um I mean it is tricky because one of the other talking points this week was that we had these great performances from the popular cheap midfielders right uh Rogers with a goal and two bonus Sania with a goal and three bonus even bernon Johnson uh came through with a goal and U it's it feels like a little polarized in terms of like you're getting returns from the five million guys and the 12 million guys and it's like you don't want to have like a 9 million midfielder right or like even like a 9 million forward like I I I've had hins the last few weeks and he's been hugely disappointed right and it feels like uh he's foden yeah he's my foden exactly yeah he's my uh he's my Rushmore Brandon uh and so that's that's that's what's happening with me right now um yeah I thought Brenan Johnson I mean he's like talk about a player is past the eye test he really he does look really good in these matches and um probably overdue to get a goal and he plays uh he plays Leaf Davis next week uh who loves getting roasted on Brennan Johnson's side talk about yeah Leaf Davis the poor man's gardial right uh with the I mean I guess he's normally more of an assist guy than a goal scorer but but I mean like he's uh he's no one's uh he's no one's idea of a great defensive player but he just gets gets yeah oh yeah it was awesome I know it felt it's a little bad for them um conceding because uh are they still without a win on the season too I believe so yes yeah and Southampton did pick up their first win too kind of a kind of a close one with that I that that side decision was really tight I don't know if you saw the moleno uh just just getting robbed of FPL points people always complain about so there's all this like esoteric fantasy crap like bonus Point systems and uh and like where am I holding midfielder points you know what I hate I hate the fact that you get clean sheet points only to have them taken away and that just doesn't it makes everyone feel bad okay that's true they shouldn't award the clean sheet points till the game is over that's a good that's that's true because I hate I hate logging into my team when there's a clean sheet in there right yeah I don't even like toing yourself yeah I thought you meant he had uh supplied the assist for the uh the beta no I just wanted some clean I just wanted some points was that so much to ask it was it was so much to it was too much to ask um all right well let's Okay one final thing here Brandon which is uh man united assets we get the uh the Bruno um pen uh uh we also got a holand uh assist I suppose right I mean he earned the pen some really uh Clowny goalkeeping from Sanchez I thought on that on that particular play you just cannot touch the player right like that's of course he's gonna dive like every you and I would dive if like a goalkeeper touches your feet you have to fall over if you're in the box that's just what you do right um and so um but like I mean defensively they were I thought they were okay like they like you said they were they were up for this match and um it took a kind of a screamer right a great goal from outside the box for them to even concede anything in this match so um did you come away like slightly more interested in any man united assets or did you think it was all just kind of a well the their defense I guess was more impressive mazari was the player who I liked the most in the match and my main issue with Manchester United was I thought their attack was was uh pretty blunt and not great yeah uh like garnacho was I think easily the worst player on the pitch which like you know I it's one match and you would want to be very optimistic as a Manchester United supporter that things are going on the right direction and garnacho is allowed to have a bad match um would I would I Bank on garnacho over Marcus rashford at this point um probably but still um it was like holand rashford garnacho I was like well this is like I don't know how far you can go with these three guys up front it feels like Bruno and mazari were the guys who impressed me the most I mean could you could you is is Onana gonna beat CS to the punch in my goalkeeping Wild Card position yeah I mean it's uh I mean their next their next I mean yeah I wonder if you end up talking yourself into an early wild card here Brandon honestly because I mean the trio of matches coming up for Man United are probably as As Good As It Gets right they have um Lester at home in gameweek 11 IP switch away in gameweek 12 and Everton at home in gameweek 13 so it's it's a trio of really strong matches I mean I I think I don't know it's like maybe it's not your particular Squad Brandon but like just because I'm talking to you like but I I think like someone out there if they want to be a little bit different this actually probably for the first time this season BR I'll say this this actually might be the time to get Bruno and just and just take a punt and see if he can uh deliver for you because uh the the like the chance of a like extreme return from him is never going to be higher than it is in the next three weeks right like a high ceiling kind of return like either Lester at home if such a way again like they're unpredictable like Lester especially but um but unpredictability can be good in fantasy too right like you could see a bunch of goals uh you know you know from from both squads in this match so um I don't know yeah it's interest I mean I guess like I do think that GAR I don't know like garnacho maybe um holand I'm still I feel like the jury's still out I don't quite believe it yet but um I don't know and then you have xery come on and I'm like I'm always kind of um like I forget he's there right I'm like oh like xery you know which is a I always want to say I always want to say Xerxes by the way too like the old um Emperor ruler it's like a or whatever right yeah yeah um yeah well I don't think you have to really spend too much time thinking about xery you'll be fine yeah fair enough all right well let's uh move on here Brandon um why don't you uh give a quick uh patreon um what do you promote our patreon I I i' I'd love to and you know we don't want to sell it too hard but you know every week Josh and I we show up and we we put this content together for you if you like what you hear if you want to say thanks and also get to be a part of what we feel is a pretty rich and rewarding FPL Community uh on our Discord we hear hear that all the time U people having uh good Live Match Day chats joining extra mini leagues and uh getting up to all sorts of funny stuff on the Discord plus you get an extra podcast every week uh at the uh at the highest tiers uh and they're not when I say highest tiar Josh they're not that high you can go to patreon.com cheating find that tier that fits right for you but we do love those Thursday night pods just for our patreon supporters uh with no ads we talk about our final uh roughly final decisions right before the deadline so yeah check it out patreon.com cheating for more information on how you can say thanks and get more FPL content in return that's very soft Sals like a like our friend Lex G trying to sell his patreon most apologetic yeah listen you can join my Pat around but if you don't listen I get it I like trust me like I really get it I wouldn't do it myself I would I think you're an idiot if you join my patreon nonetheless it's there yeah I will say the Discord is really genuinely fantastic and it's like there's conversation going on all the time uh and it's really really taken on a life of its own I mean it's sort of like it does not need in in fact uh i s feel like we gum up the works when we get in there Brandon it's like we do not need us around for to for to go and I also think the patreon are um they're a lot looser and more fun and I I actually think they must be we must be happy with what with how they're going because I feel like we often bring up stuff we talked about in the patreon pods on on the Main feed pod as well so if you um you know if you want a different voice it's like it's like a nice way to like easier way into the weekend too because the the uh I feel like the tone is much kind of looser and lighter so uh patreon.com where you can go uh Brandon let's now move on and take a look at gameweek 11 all right so game week 11 and I will uh share of course we'll we'll talk through it but I'll share it just so you and I can um uh be on the same page but we can so we can read from the same prayer book as you like to say yes love to say that yeah and so this is the final game week before uh the next International break I know you are hoping uh it would come sooner Brandon but don't worry you've got uh You' got coming yeah we're almost there it's um they really Jam them in um and uh I'm also sad to tell you this is the last International break I believe until March so it's a nice I know exactly everybody uh you know so are your kind of um what is International Champions Cup head whatever they call this I don't the Nations League the Nations League I can't keep up with any of these things anymore Brandon they get rebranded all the time and it's uh yeah you can tell how I feel about them just from that expression there so I they do get I will say the international breaks get better when you have stuff like World Cup qualifying thrown into the mix right I think that that does raise the stakes a little bit but when it's just like friendlies yeah it's hard for me to stay who cares who bloody cares yeah exactly so um all right so anyway game week 11 uh so we have matches just on Saturday and Sunday it's your classic uh post Champions League Europa League split bunch of matches are on uh Sunday so U of course that is a reminder that on Tuesday and Wednesday we have Champions League games L week games on Thursday uh involving I think six Premier League squads play at midweek so um if you can hold hold off on your transfers unless you're really tight on uh budget I would I would try to do so we saw just this last week with the with the League Cup right which in theory should be less of a like lift but the The League Cup uh there were a bunch of people knocked out uh from that as a as a among them so um yeah I think that it's it's an interesting uh slate of fixtures though I mean the one that as I talked about at the beginning of the Pod that stands out to me is that Spurs IP switch match and for me I I just don't have anybody for that match right now and um that feels like the one where I could really it's a little bit like uh the Arsenal Southampton match um several weeks ago where I was like well maybe I can just maybe I can just skate by well I don't you know I have one defender in that match I'll just I'll just skate by and it'll be fine like how how bad could it be not having Saka or uh you know you anybody else in that game yeah it was terrible it was like a it was a you know it upended my season in some ways right I took a massive hit so I that is the one where I'm like I feel like I kind of want to get into that um into that attack if I can and so I I am sort of looking at salony for that one um let's see Southampton I mean wolves saw South Southampton the other Squad where you're kind of you want to Target your fixtur if you can and uh I will say again uh strand Larson continues to put in some nice performances if they I you know I I don't find wolves to be trustworthy at all I certainly wouldn't recommend bringing in any of their assets at the moment but they're at least like back in in the conversation of sort of getting like they're more fantasy relevant than West Ham at this point Brandon so that's that's something I guess why West Ham persisting with this uh La pategi it's it's really kind of funny like at least O'Neal at wolver Hampton like there's some there's I don't know there's no point in talking about either these teams but yeah like wolves wolves is the bandwagon in FPL right now Kia and Larson are the main guys as well um so lots of fun cheap guys to choose from where West Ham like the the players you might want to pick up like Bowen are just like too expensive for what you're getting for that team so so I get it um but I agree like wolves just don't like they're just just because the fixtures turned doesn't mean they're suddenly a good outfit and I think they have so much still to prove yeah and you don't have that kind of one asset that like um like Quang Chan last I guess like what they do is score goals I think there may be they may be one of the teams that's like never they've they've scored in every every match so far this season like let's let's see let's look at their their matches scored scored scored scored scored scored scored scored yeah yeah yeah they had scored in every match so so like goals I guess is what you're trying goals and assists is what you're trying to buy yeah unfortunately they concede it roughly a two to one ratio I I was thinking and I know this isn't super fantasy either but I just because it's on my mind I was thinking watching that because that was the um I guess Arsenal failed to score against him anyway sorry okay nine out of 10 then uh but it was the Fe the featured match uh for some reason uh on Saturday was this this wolves uh Palace game and uh so I was watching it and I was thinking about um whether because both the goals I mean they were just like they're so Shaggy defensively and it's like and I was wondering I'm like is that on O'Neal and if so if it if it is on him like you you like you have to sack him right it's like I mean or it's like or it's like a talent thing or something but it's like if you actually thought that he was at fault for they've been so bad defensively that he would have to go like I so I feel like it's not I guess like I'm saying that because I don't know that it is him but it's like it's feels weird that they're so poor defensively yes you would think that yes the the manager might be able to turn the screws there tighten it up a bit and uh it's being sacrificed but yeah maybe the club just says our only ambition this season given the circumstances of 17th Place and right just given like how much it would cost us to sack O'Neal and we probably wouldn't get any like anybody remarkably better um give him give him like a this good fixture run like I expect if wolves are still uh like like firmly in the relegation Zone after this run through through like the end of the year then he'll be sacked for sure yeah I think so too um and I'm not advocating for sacking him I think um I think in general these squads probably move a little too quickly um to sa these guys but um yeah so anyway well I think we have an we have an interesting slate on uh Saturday and Sunday uh a very late match on Saturday I love when they do this they've been doing these a little more often Brandon and uh late game Liverpool uh hosting Aston Villa um I don't know what to think about Aston Ville anymore I mean it's it's a real like I hate I hate this cliche but it's like you know A Tale of Two Hales situation right like first half it's they look you know scoring a set piece look pretty strong defensively second half they can Siege four and I'm like I don't know quite what to make of them right now I think they've really been bit by the same bug as Newcastle when they got to the Champions League um that to thin yeah yeah and also just like the learning curve to be fighting on on those fronts and the Onana coming into the Midfield and of Douglas Louise I think is like it's a good signing but I just don't think it's clicked fully and I think that that really does weaken their um just like what they're trying to do transitionally yeah and he uh he went off as well didn't he or maybe maybe he just got hurt I can't remember if he actually went off in the match in the end hold on I'm pulling up the the match tracks cuz I don't I don't recall as as well I have uh Rogers off injured no uh Onana stayed on the pitch the entire time okay he did because I I remember at one point he got like walloped by somebody um but yeah and so I think that should be a fun match though regardless I'm looking forward to uh Liverpool Villa it's uh I mean I have um I mean I I don't know like I mean do you think that you'll Captain Salah this week again it's between Salah and Holland um I mean there's there's really no great science to it uh Salo is my bus team captain but Brighton you know there are there are reasons why we used Salah to Target Brighton this week they have injuries and they do play very open so can Holland just like pull the finger out can he actually start finishing some chances if so because you know I don't know the big brain way of thinking of Holland right now is uh wow maybe he's an edge to like be the last person who has Faith uh enough to Captain Holland yeah so I don't hate the brighten away fixture for Holland and uh as you're saying like I also do not hate borderline I like the home fixture against Villa fala yeah um yeah I I I think that makes sense I mean yeah and like how different is this uh conversation of Holland just converts that massive chance he has late in the vmou match yeah I'd probably like C defin I yeah I'd definitely be uh bus team Holland all the way in that situation for sure yeah yeah it just it feels like it's like reflective though of a little bit of it's like it's on the one hand sure it's unlucky and the other hand it's like reflective of him just not he's just not smashing the ball the way he kind of does when he's like in really good form right and fill confidence the chances just aren't that good and there's there's just too many crosses that he's being uh asked to convert cuz he's terrible in the air unless like he's unless he's doing like a scissor kick or something like there is just not enough space for Holland uh I I think that this is why another reason to just get rid of fod in ASAP uh because de bruyne is seems Seems crucial to help Hollen find that space yeah there's something about I don't know if it's something to do with rodery not being there or something like that but it's like I feel like the Holland really thrives and I think kdb and rodri have both been good at sort of finding him in these spaces we like he's kind of like halfway in between um the center circle and the opposition goal right and it's like if you can get him in the ball with space like in that in that area he is so good I feel like driving forward and using his speed and I feel like but the way the matches have been going and I you know I'm maybe it's just because the ball is getting more clogged up Midfield and so the other team isn't Comm committing as many players forward and so they're able to kind of get back and stop these stop these chances I'm not really sure but well C just have the ball all the time and third they doing nothing yeah they have the ball all the time and they're scoring like a goal a game it's like it's it's yeah it's so it's just not and so he just he's in the Box constantly right it just like it's like he he turns into like some Tony pus forward right just like waiting for you know something to that he can put his head on right and like that's sort of I don't yeah I agree that he's he's not thriving in this this current role so but with that said I think um I agree I think it's like it's pretty close between um Holland and and Salah uh other I mean I suppose um salanki as a captaincy feels a little like a little too like what have you done for me lately uh Sun I actually wouldn't mind if you had son in your squad I think Sun if a I just feel like I all these memories over the years of sun Captain Sun for these like easy fixtures and him like not because you know he is so good on the Counterattack right and he's so good at like converting these low XG chances and soon as I feel like when they're playing a team that they're just like clearly better than it's it doesn't actually suit his you just gave me a great idea like yeah all these uh optimal uh stats and predictive models for Fantasy I want a model that's just sheerly based on your memory um hey how about how about this for an idea by the way this is not related to what you just said but um why don't you why don't you use this other transfer uh to bring in Sun this week and then wild card and gameweek 12 why don't you have Sun for this for the IP switch fixture and then kind of like kind of like PL to dead end your team and wild card into the next game week I game week 12 is already a good time to wild card anyway so that's that's an interesting I'm I'm not convinced that sun is a worthwhile fantasy asset I guess I I did just outline all the reasons uh not to necess but I'm just saying like it's it's an interesting strategy I think that there is some like it it could work right because sure sure yeah um I mean and and gameweek 12 over the international break is a fantastic time to wild card because Arsenal do have that huge fixture turn and Cole Palmer becomes like even more like his his fixtures are even more enhanced as well so lots of different teams that you want to jump on so um I don't hate treating gameweek 11 as kind of like a wild punt sort of a game wake I get it yeah I mean especially because I don't I don't think that Palmer is like super essential for game 11 anyway right because uh even with Arsenal flailing a little bit I I don't see Chelsea scoring like three goals in this match right I think it's gonna be he they may score one and he scores that goal but I just don't see it as like a like a wide openen kind of game maybe I'm wrong about that but yeah I know I don't know what to make of it uh either I mean I think it's going to resemble a lot of what we saw in the Chelsea Manchester United match today uh I think it might look pretty similar to that and then I thought Chelsea just like really didn't call upon their attacking prowess enough which it was kind of odd like they they just didn't show what they could do Nicholas Jackson was like incredibly Anonymous until I realized he got a yellow card and I'm just like how does this guy always somehow find a way to get a yellow card even when you don't even see him on the pitch it's very very funny to me um but uh yeah I don't know but but having foden going into gameweek 11 also feels like and these just like bitter tears of fod and just being a complete dud the last couple of weeks does feel like um like he's a waste of a spot in a fantasy squad for one week and that does feel way too passive for me like like yes as you say like foden could doesn't have to become Palmer he could become anyone playing these these fixtures he could become Brennan Johnson for for that matter um right let's see who are the who would be like the other Plum fixture like Southampton who W Wolves yeah I mean I I it it would really probably be Lina what's that yeah L yeah bring in lamina Mario Mario Jr as he's now called on on the website yeah it's Mario Jr I guess I mean honestly like you could you could look at Bruno um as a again it just it just yeah yeah I mean Brun like I I actually think there's like a quite good chance he gets some kind of attacking return in that Lester match so um yeah I guess again it's it's a luxury for you a little bit just because you have this wild card that you could maybe you know Punt and and maybe try to get one up on other managers right like that's sort of the advantage of having that wild card still is you can you can always and also they play if switch in 12 so it doesn't you wouldn't you wouldn't be dead ending with him so um I know it's an interesting thought well then yeah that's another reason for me to just like punt on the Wild Card bring in Bruno and the don't play the Wild Card yeah as as we all know Bruno Fernandez solves all fantasy problems always has uh always will all right we got a couple questions here Brandon um let's get into them I think I have I have two questions that I've selected uh one is from uh FPL Brooklyn uh Arsenal have just not been clicking offensively or defensively should we stick for their gameweek 12 fixture swing so this is the this is a key question I think at this point it's really interesting I thought their lineup against Newcastle was pretty solid bar you know uh acknowledging that odard is out right you know their defense was you know there were lots of injury concerns and I thought they had a pretty strong defense that that they lined up with so it's like it's not a Personnel issue there just seems to be a real mental block and that's the thing I guess that's the root of the question is do do good fixtures help even the most depressed team and Arsenal seem kind of depressed answer yes actually okay for the record I I I do think that like I mean defensively that that's the thing that's like giv me a little bit of pause I mean they they're like they're certainly like their their numbers are still fine defensively but it does feel like um I don't it's just a weird time with them because you don't really have that like one and I guess that's what I mean like if you're if you're like okay like I guess just to sort of look at the whole team Saka yes like I think that Saka is fine kind of regardless a fixture we saw that last week too right gameweek gameweek uh nine and uh yeah he had one blank and Newcastle away it's always a tricky fixture especially whatever reason for Arsenal right there's just like these certain I I don't know why there's certain squads that just seem to struggle with certain teams right it's like it feels like uh um for a long time it was like man city and Crystal Palace had this like weird you know but when Arsenal go to Newcastle it's just always a tough match and so it seems like Newcastle are kind of like especially up for it or something uh and so I think long term he's still a buy I mean I think you could buy him as as soon as as soon as this Chelsea match and and it'd be fine um defensively though I think it is a little bit trickier because you you know it's just it's Gabrielle right and and that's kind of it I mean um like at this point I wouldn't rebi celba um I don't think that that's um I mean I will I guess long term like I think he's fine but like I would I would go Gabriel first if I was going that way but again it's just like they don't feel super solid at the moment and you know they're coning a lot of goals and so basically you're like bringing him in in the hopes that you get like they get a bunch of set pieces right and he can like get his head on one which is which is like a an argument for him like for sure like I'm not diminishing that but um I don't know it's like outside of Saka there's no one I'd be really excited to bring in right now yeah they're they're really the Man City defense right now is they will they will make one or two huge mistakes this Arsenal defense a match at this point yeah um and uh I there's there's something going on there and I mean H's hovert Saka uh I think are they they will get their points a huge concern with the Arsenal attack is just like how bad trer and Martinelli have have been just last couple weeks so trer in particular this weekend was was quite poor but um there's just no magic anywhere else in the team right now in the Midfield like r Rice and um God I can can Moreno I never remember that guy's name M Moreno uh there's just not a huge amount of dynamism in that partnership yet uh I think there will be this is like this Arsenal team is built for next season as far as I'm concerned yeah well it's just like I there was like at some moment when like it was like Dean rice like does his best to try to create a goal by himself and I'm like is this like a problem is this like an actual problem that needs to get solved at this point which is that Delan rice like doesn't want to be a defensive midfielder anymore and it's like is this like is there a connection I mean it's obviously a great player but his setpiece delivery was was complete was horrible uh against Newcastle I'm just like are could they be creting better chances if he wasn't kind of like Solo in it where he's like I'm going to run in I'm going to be like vintage Yaya t not but he's not doing that that's just commentators uh loving like the you know the the handsome pristine looking Englishmen Irish maybe so I feel like uh I feel like I like I'm seeing a little too much of it myself but I I don't know I just I I just I something's going on with that defense and and I'm not quite uh maybe it's just I don't know it's only 10 weeks right I mean it's it's still a you know cliche alert here Brandon but it's still a small sample right like I think um uh I think by the second half of the Season Man City and Arsenal will have figured it out we'll be seeing a bunch of one nil and two- nil matches right I think that's that's that's what's coming so um for better or worse uh I guess kind of For Worse that what's what's fun about that you know well so long as Liverpool continue winning then you've got you there's there's the drama yeah absolutely oh I mean the be drama like in terms of the table but I just mean like I do feel like we've seen the last couple years a bunch of these matches where it's like they have you have two highly motivated teams playing a bunch of teams that like are kind of locked into their spot right and so it's just like one nil two nil One n two I gota um all right last questions from Neymar butland Brandon he says this is more of an existential question at what point do you stop and ask yourself the question what is my team I feel as though I've been following so many pieces of advice and adding so many random players who I'm not sure about or not watch play with my own eyes yes I want to make fantasy fun again yes but I also want to make my own team my team again 100% how do I do that I mean the the answer is quite evident I think is you have to stop stop all non always cheating content you know St seeking advice taking advice uh looking at other people's team I mean the whole the whole when fantasy content and discussion is at its best uh and it's something you know we strive for we don't always achieve is you know what let's talk about fantasy in terms of uh how much did did you have a good week A bad week uh did you watch any matches was it cool I don't want your Excel okay I I don't this this isn't not like a this is not meant to be spirited rant baseball was better before uh yeah Moneyball like anyway um this I know what you mean now this question resonates with me because um I I find myself in this position all the time I mean I guess like foden just to he he is like my example for everything on this episode that was a decision that I made without necessarily look looking at for advice or uh Consulting any tables or anything like that like I did it it was all me and still when I look at my team right now there's something about the aura that it puts out that doesn't feel like something that I necessarily wanted or would missing a six million goalkeeper is really yeah right yeah I me come on you gota if that's your calling card you got to honor it it's like the the the who are the the water Bandits or who are the guys in Home Alone yeah yeah the wet Bandits the wet Bandits you know they they had the argument like we can't you know turn the water on cuz that's how they'll catch us and he's like no but we got to have a a calling card so even if it's like is to your detri to be fair Joe pesi who didn't want to do that was was validated in the end right because they said oh we found all these uh we we have all these other crimes where they did the same thing so now we can retroactively well it's fine that that character did get his come up in in the hit movie casin which we talked about last week I think it was crazy what they did to the wet bandits in that cornfield that's true yeah Daniel Stern uh he's in the you can't see him actually but he go into that he goes into that shallow gra first I think yeah that would be incredible if it was part of Cino was part of the Home Alone Universe G in the same time it's very possible um but yeah like I think it's I I I think you've got to uh make sure that there is your DNA in in your team otherwise you're 100% going to be uh not going to have fun unless you're like winning the uh FPL and that's that's hard that's a tight RPP yeah I think you just I mean this was me a year or two ago and um the the answer is you just have to drastically reduce your amount of consumption uh I think of of fantasy content I mean again I hope you continue to listen to this podcast if you're an hour in then you then then I think you're a you know you're a a fan or a support or whatever but like there's a lot of um like I just basically don't spend time on Twitter anymore that was kind of the way that I solv this right like I just I was just on there too much I was watched many teams and I it just gets in your head and then it's it's honestly like there's a bit of like fear of missing out right you're just like ah man like everybody's going for this player if he you know if he delivers and uh and I'm on here all day on Saturday or whatever I'm just gonna be kicking myself and feeling like I'm the biggest idiot for not doing that but if you're not on these spaces all day then then that stuff can't hurt you right and um and so I think that's uh I mean yeah you can go the other way and be like oh yeah like when they when they don't do well I get to have shot for or whatever but like that's not like the greatest emotion either right like it's it's kind of it's not like the healthiest way to be like Oh I'm just like playing to root against people or whatever right so right you know it's like better to just like again this is like a a big theme for us this year but it's like focus on your mini leagues like you know like focus on that worry about that world and and then it's like yeah what are the what are the people in your mini leagues what do their squads look like right like maybe you've got to be the one who sends the email every week you know or gets the um the mini league mate dossier and distributes it right like the way you do Brandon twice you do it for two different leagues um I love I love my mini league mates yeah exactly and it's like you know so like invest in that stuff and and then I think it doesn't matter so much um like you you won't worry so much about whether you have like the right players or the right template or whatever practically speaking though how do you make sure you have good uh players you like who are still good fantasy assets so it's it's all well and good to say well just fill your team with guys you like um you know and that's how you end up with like Adam Wharton in in your team or something I mean I think like you've got to use uh you like well you have to like I mean you have to be like a little bit of strategically smart about some of this stuff right you got to have some common sense and I think um I I will say though that even though I've reduced my consumption I'm still uh I you I have two different um uh like FPL review which we talked about in this podcast before and and ml talk them these like Services where they just like produce numbers right and and and believe me like I am not just like picking the stuff that's that's that's generated from there nor are you right I mean we we certainly talk about them and they're interesting but that at least always gives me a but like listen like they've had Bruno has been at the top of these charts for like 10 weeks right so like clearly like it is not for like months sa for so long as well right just has been doing nothing um I guess he got an assist last week um and so uh but there that at least I think gives you like a little Baseline right like the Mel talk thing I think it's like 199 right it's like nothing and then you like and then you can at least like pull up a little data chart be like okay because it's like a you know like okay I see like uh maybe I should look at these five players just because they're all at the top of the chart and they weren't necessarily on my radar and then you look and you're like ah right it's like it's like man united right where you're like oh I didn't realize they played Lester if switch and Everton in the next three right and so maybe I should be um considering them more seriously stuff like that for sure all right yeah you you can do this yeah I think by by Christmas your your team will have a little bit more more flavor uh I'm sure of it Neymar Neymar butland also change your change your fantasy team name to Neymar butland FC I think that sounds sounds like sounds a b like Leroy Jenkins doesn't it Leroy Jenkins uh all right Brandon let's wrap things up here thank you so much for listening uh I I am feeling by the way that fall forward all of a sudden it's hit like a like a like a brick yeah just one brick not a ton of bricks but one one's big Bri like a huge brick right uh and uh can't be a loadbearing maybe it is the maybe it's the one loadbearing brick Brandon in the P the whole house of cards is about to collapse if we don't sign off pretty soon here yeah quite right um so go to

voice heard okay all right get out there and vote everybody get make your voice make your voice heard vot the one basic civic duty that you can do and if nothing else the least you can do i dont know about you by the way im getting i cannot stop getting texts like even when i like even when im like blocking or like listen i think you can support a political party without wanting to get an email the increasingly desperate email right its like pathetic its like were gonna were all gonna die if you dont get eight and then its like but also we have so much money that were gonna like rent out the sphere so im like i dont like how do i square all this like how much does it cost to rent the sphere up thats got to be 20m but it seems expensive for sure we should run out the sphere if we ever do cheaters las vegas if we ever go to the thats true if we ever go back to the to win we need to do the pod from the sphar that is true we havent i havent heard anything about podcasts being broadcast at the spere i think an always a an english premier league fantasy podcast would be an incredible forget call her daddy or whatever heard forget joseph rogo winsky like no all right lets do it lets do a clean start here brandon for real all right hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you im all right josh slow im a little worried because its its we have we fell back brandon we in america this last night was our fallback so for us were recording this after nine its eight oclock on the on the on the official clock brandon but my body clock is telling me that its 908 pm right now so see how we how what our stamina is like the even go on here i dont know if im feeling tired because we we think its later than it is or if im feeling tired just watching my rank remain exactly the same every week i ive caught up with you but well you okay like lets just get it right into it then shall we because i think i i think you want we fell back into our classic patterns this week for good or for ill i have been i have been aggressive this season and it has backfired sometimes and it has worked out sometimes right and its like theyve theyve neutralized like depending on like where this week ends up im im probably gonna be at my highest rank since gw three and that was right when i decided to take it make an ultra aggressive wild card brandon wild card had a lot of high performers for a lot of low performers right it seemed like a good idea at the time and so ive like im like jerry br ive come out in the middle somehow here so you are now like its been seven weeks since then where how are you feeling you feel like youre stuck in place after 11 its not over yet theres still one i do feel stuck i can certainly easily pinpoint what the problem has been it was ive lost two weeks to phil foden and remember we did a patreon pod before like the game week nine deadline and i was contemp in chris wood and guardal in or i ended up going with moleno and phil foda which you did on the pod in real time like i maybe thats a dangerous game right there is the real time transfer i dont know if you maybe you maybe you were concerned about radiance brandon and it was it was a it was like a season ending cliff i will sacrifice my overall rank to get those numbers up for sure now i dont think it was a bad idea at the time foden was certainly coming back into the city squad city it cuts both ways like foden space became more secure because of injuries and citys form became has become quite poor because in man city were about to play southampton at home right going into game week nine like its not i dont think you have to retroactively bang your head against the wall too much he also had a very good match in gw nine but better i think in nine than in 10 i havent looked at his like the underlying performance from foden it was one of i was i was watching multiple matches on sunday i saw him miss a pretty good chance i feel like it was in the first half but i assume you were watching more closely than me so what did you think about foden well he was fine yes he didnt have as many clearcut opportunities for fantasy points than he did against southampton and city just they looked worse this week certainly they could not create any big chances and what chances they made holland chief among them it just couldnt finish them at all holland was quite poor now i dont want to get too like morose about that transfer two weeks ago because there is always a ripple effect over the course of a month plus and so what i what where im at right now with the foden move is if i had done the gardial wood move a couple weeks ago i would be in incredible shape right now because guardos hit in those two weeks as his w however i wouldnt be in a position to for free this week get triple premium so now im just totally enamored of the triple premium and i would have i if i have already done hovers to wood and now i can for free on exact money do fod in to palmer and so now i can like im in that im heading into that gw wi transfer window of just like looking at awe in awe at my team which is honestly never where you want to be because thats usually when things goly but just to finish that point i wouldnt be able to get pmer right now if i had done those other moves so its an interesting fantasy conundrum of would you trade those points for the last two weeks to get your optimal team at the moment well and were about to be i im glad you brought up the the premium situation because i think that was if there was like a big talking point in fantasy this week and one that i think i came to late i was a little reluctant to embrace it and it was it was do we just give up on holland at the moment like is there enough chaos at man city with all of the injuries we joked on the patreon pol last week about peps grumpy press conference right where he was like i dont know everyones on the everyones getting a massage right now theyre all on the train whatever ive got nine players or whatever this like once a year pep has like a press conference like this right where hes like we have no money we have no its a like he cant help it right but i its fine we all you wonder though it is positive thats peps hes communicating to his team in that moment of like im i see whats going on here and im even going to communicate through the press to you that like get it together you its not that so but to me its like it feels like more defeatist than that right its like i dont know like well see if we can scratch out a point this weekend with our with our mash unit so and they and they didnt they got semano which was pretty awesome i have been in the antoine seano fan club for well i dont know for a year right like it has not been for multiple seasons but going back to last season i thought he was he was fantastic he lost a little bit of i feel like he didnt have the spotlight last year because he was in a complimentary role to dominic salanki who also had a great season for bournemouth but sano was just this rightwing who was just making all sorts of things happen down the stretch for bournemouth last season and even with sank gan and evan nelson coming in hes still doing that and i its interesting because its i dont know its like i dont know if im going to he may not even in my team because there are so many cheap midfielders and i have to decide between him and morgan rogers i think if im gna go with the with the thrum the thrum approach which im leaning towards as well by the way at the moment i dont know i theres a couple of injuries too weve got like palmer is flagged now and morgan rogers is flagged and we need to see where these guys are over the next couple days they both should be fine morgan rogers it was like it was like i couldnt tell if he just got kicked one too many times right because he went down once right like right around the 60th minute i remember because i was like watching the cl i was i did you start rogers this week as well i did so i was like watching the clock im like wait is he going off here too because it was like 5940 when he was on the ground and then he went down a second time and thats when they took him off about 10 minutes later so i think hes probably fine its like the classic knock right contact injury and i didnt even see what happened with palmer nor i played the full 90 played the full 90 but now hes hes got a flag on the site too so well see what the deal is there it could be one of these like chris wood style injuries right where chris wood it was like it seemed like he was gna be fine and he was right like in general theres like theres there are two kinds of 75 flags right theres the like seems like theyre fine should be fine and the 75 flag thats more like zero out for six months man or like exactly like e like e was 75 exactly like they were 75 until the manager definitively came out and said that they were i dont know you like never see a 50 flag anymore i feel like like its its like 50 and 25 like those its poiz its our polarized climate now josh its its everythings very black and white either youre on one side or the other either injured or youre not interesting you think theres flag hurting going on like this pole hurting i keep they want everything to be 75 maybe so but anyway just to get back to the premium thing for a second because i think it was interesting the question was i think for a lot of us we were debating between salah and holland you had sala already so it was a little easier for you to just stick with holland i would have done the same thing if i had if i had holland but not having sala and wanting to longterm make this move to have three premiums and if you want to get into that we talked about it for like a half hour on last weeks pod right so we dont think we need to rehash it go through all of it again but i think the idea is that it does seem like virtually every week theres going to be three out of four of these guys are going to deliver interestingly this was the week where it was just one right it was just salah and if you had salah and you captain him he just got nine points which isnt that much but nine points with a blank feels huge right and so i think that was i dont think many people have no s over holland its possible but i think most people have one of the two and so you saw i think a big contrast in returns and if you just had salon captain him that was probably enough for you to be in a gray or green arrow you and i both have i believe three players in the monday match right right i have smith row you have rul and then we both have momo and robinson so were were rooting for mass chaos in the monday night fixture i forget who did you bench to to bring you started g or you started your did you who did you bench that you could start your full in midfielder i ended up benching liam deap so that i could start emil smith row so when we talked on thursday night with her patreon supporters my thought was well the lester fixture is choice thats like thats grade a beef for le and deap and the more i just thought about it the more like my real just like confidence in ip switch is like fully waning and i just decided to trust that and then also go for the fun of having as many players as possible in the final fixture of the game we and also like roll with my fen boys so yep im thrilled that i made that choice and then i had consa the other choice i had to make this weekend was kana or pedro poro in my defense and i opted to bench kaa and then villa are first to score and i think yet again ive blown it i w i won in the end josh one point from poro instead of zero from kaa so i take that as a win i know thats always the l like when you when the kaa thing was like when that late goal and youre like well who does that help salanki owners but then it was like well it hurts the con of st they lose they lose extra point from that so i think it was interesting weekend so what i ultimately ended up doing and ill ill share my team here just that we can we can talk through it a little bit is i did end up making the move its funny i went on i went and like apologized on on our discord because i was like listen i didnt talk about this move at all on last nights pod where we talked about our moves for a half hour because just was extremely reluctant to part ways with holland and i ultimately decided it was worthwhile to do it just because i you it was the only way i could get to saka as well right and so im thinking it was like a move that was made with gw 12 in mind right which is when the fixers finally get a little bit better for for arsenal and i think for you its its a little different because you still have a wild card to play right and so for you dont be thinking long term and its its so funny im like setting myself up for all of these like perfect moves meanwhile i have a wild card where i could just do it whenever i wanted what is are you thinking you might just you might just use it like you might just hold off and listen i just like to sometimes i like to flex and hey listen i put it in the comments if you want to see brandon not play his wild card i want to hear from you so i am im on 48 on the week so far and its its i so i brought in gardial and that has worked out extremely well because i was debating between guio and lewis and you could certainly make it a the case for lewis is that hes 13m cheaper and felt like he was fairly locked into the squad but not so fast right kyle walker comes back in gets the captains armband the real life one not the fantasy one and then to make things even worse rico lewis comes on as the late sub right so youre getting the like the nightmare scenario for if youre a lewis owner whereas vardal gets clean sheet and three bonus last week and then scores a goal he like didnt even celebrate the goal like that was it was the classic like i dont even know like this is good because they were they were down twonil and he wanted to you keep it rolling its a hes a soldier of fortune hes just out there to do a job and make sure like a hessan troop in the revolutionary war brandon i like it so hes a i like that lets start calling gardial the hessen on this po moving forward for it so gardial and so but i did i dropped holland for raul i considered salanki that was the algo recommended move and brandon score one for the alos because in the first in the first half of that spurs match i was like see no salani this is like this is this is smart this is wise like us managers exactly humans went again im watching these games okay i know not to get salanki like smash cut to the end of the match where hes got two goals and an assist and looked great too like totally completely different player and he ends up in 16 points so r no pressure tomorrow just outscore dominic sanki 16 points and will be good but so rogers came through that with nine jamie vardy who lowkey has been fine like totally fine as a as a as my cheap forward i got five points for him this week a nice assist too in the iu goal and jordan iio by the way just hanging around like hes hes gonna be like danny wellb back just 17 seasons in hes still going to be getting minutes for these squads not starter anymore but he can like he can come he can come in and do a job like this is his second sub appearance goal in two matches so so but i got a an assist from b got a goal and two bonus last week and a goal the week before that so you perfectly respectable returns for a sub6 million forward and watkins blanks and i think thats looking ahead to gw 11 i think thats where my brain is and i have to say brandon i did not think id be doing this on the pop but i also didnt think id be dropping holland last week so watkins to dominic salani looms as a possible gw 11 transfer whats your watkins is about to price drop in the next hour while we do you have you have room wiggle room there he rose in price after i bought him so hes at n i bought him at nine hes at 91 now so it would just it wouldnt matter and so watkins to salan spurs play if switch in gw 11 makes some logical sense id like to wait a couple of days to do it if i could because they do have a europa league match on thursday so ideally i would i would wait until after that well see how the price changes i would probably take one point1 change like another one on the chin i dont know if id take two right and so and so but i think that would feel like a fairly logical move i also have because i made this holland switch and br andala it freed up like something like three million if i do watkins to salani that would give me enough mo enough money to move either sano or rogers to saka in gw 12 okay so it like the moves almost pick themselves i feel like right barring any serious injuries i think that feels like a pretty logical move for gw 11 its just boom watkins to salani right target tot home match great fixture and the fixtures coming up for spurs 2 are enticing some people will be thrown off by the man city away fixture in game week 12 theyve got two home fixtures with ip switch and fullam on either side followed by bourn myth like a salony return home thats just got narrative written all over it thats true its like it could go could go either way right its like a non celebration i feel like no matter what right and then the two f the two tough matches following that chelsea and then li poool with southampton those two tough matches are both at home for spurs so i feel like theyre going to take a ton of confidence from this villa result this weekend after like going through a rough patch feels like a good time to have spurs assets and what do you i know neither of us have been and i should say we have not been super high on spurs salani i think you and i were both big fans of bournemouth salan sure right and so it just hasnt quite he hadnt quite clicked for spurs had some injuries also hadnt shown a particularly high ceiling right for spurs so far and does one half wipe all that away like what do you think about sank now after this match i dont how could it cant possibly like what weve seen of solanki at spurs beyond that one half has been mr back to goal scarce scant chances but it could just be as simple as playing more it expansive ambitious team like aston villa to open up the play a little bit more there was a little bit more space on the wings and that just favored salanki so it just he could just be a fixture player perhaps but just looking at the way managers are jumping having held kept the faith with salanki hes absolutely an asset to continue keeping the faith with just given like if its working for spurs its work a lot and his ceiling is like so i think what we discovered this weekend is sanis ceiling is a lot higher than we would have thought and its its still unclear what his floor is and i think its its his price is low enough that you dont have to move everything right you dont have to completely shift your team around to bring him in and so i do think hes i hate to be like the prisoner of the moment like this but i dont know when a when a forward scores a brace and has one of the worst defenses at home in the next match its those moves are pretty simple sometimes right like you dont have to overthink it too much and then the question is just do you wait until friday to make the move or you just go ahead and pull the trigger early so did you say you already made your moves for game week 11 well i did not make a transfer heading into this weekend so i have two free and ive already moved hts to wood because i have exact money to do this move to do harberts to wood and foden to cole palmer okay so ive done one half of it to catch the chriswood price rise and now i have 01 to give on foden but i cant okay manage a price her as on palmer so im just watching that and i will theres theres no real sense of me waiting too long if theres news about palmers fitness and of course bb in the youtube chat made a good point it was is that martinez challenge at the end of the man utd match where he caught cole palmer on the knee and hes fine then so he like played the rest he like had a chance shortly after that so i think its fine right so theres no reason for me to hold off because cole palmer wont be playing midweek because hes not on the chelsea team sheet for europa just yet so anyway those what is phil foden gonna do in the champions league to make me be like wow ive got a hold him i seeing de bruyne on the bench for man city with like fodens got to go like immediately now i dont even know if hes even going to play nor is there any reason to keep him and an arsenal fixture for chelsea its tough arsenal have a good defense but what a great time to play arsenal like arsenal were like in like severe i dont want to be around anymore mode this weekend and i think cole palmer just he clearly doesnt care who hes playing i think hes playing well he had a a downbeat match against man utd but it ended up being a tricky match i think just because of the the manager change right i think i the united players were up for it for sure they were up for it exactly and i think that changed things a little bit he had he could have had an assist right so it just it wasnt quite his day but i think that match for me i traditionally think of that especially i dont know seems like especially when man united host chelsea that match always i know its like the most they were saying today that in the todays broadcast that its the most drawn match in the premier league and that squares up with my own memory it does feel like every time man united host chelsea it is like a one1 or nilnil draw and im im not quite sure why that is but lets lets lets lets go back just for a moment to the beginning of gw 10 because arsenal did stumble again they played away to newcastle probably played their strongest match of the season so far and another tough match for all arsenal assets right you hovers with a onepointer socka blanked defense concedes a goal i think it was like the 12th or 15th minute i cant what eso scored fairly early in the game and and then that was it right it was i dont know like i just like its a tr i still feel like its going to turn around like i and i i at this point im almost thinking more like in terms of fantasy results than i am like the actual team like i we got our old arsenal back josh where theyre playing for fourth place again and we love it such a no i dont love it i hate it however who would have thought like the story this season was going to be like i to me it was like arsenal are finally there like theyre finally gonna push through and then like liverpool are like the not so fast like maybe well just steal this title and with man city losing today it like its its very open still clearly right like its its its i in my head i thought that man city had already lost i was surprised when i read that it was their first loss of the season like they just had a couple of theyve had these like the draw with arsenal the late win over have we been so have we been so warped by like the last fiveish years where you can only win the te title if youre undefeated like there were barclays the barclays era of the premier league has been in the air this season lets go back where you can lose like five matches and still win the title thats exciting thats cool i think its cool too like i hope we have a threeway or more race i think that would be awesome the other cool story was there were a couple questions too about forest but forest in third place which i think is so cool like its i think its its just fun like even fantasy aside its its just always like every year theres one team like last year it was villa right and i dont know that i genuinely think that forest could get a champions league spot but i think that theyre they could they sneak into like a europa league spot maybe they have a they have a strong defense they have some callum hudson they have players like callum hudson m doy who like are like highly pedigreed players right whove battled injury and for there was a time a few years ago i dont remember this when chelsea were fending off bayern munich who were making a big push for callum hudson m so then he had this like it was like he was trying to get into that break into that squad and like i was like like lets make him left wing back hudson adoi right it was like they were like trying everything to make it work and i just wonder if that screw with him a little bit its like a its like a like a baseball hitter who theyre like like you should change your swing right so that you can hit more home runs like change your launch angle right and then suddenly its like they cant they cant do anything anymore and i just wonder and last year he battled injuries on and off too what what also screws with your confidence when your club buys 20 other left wingers right exactly my god and i thought enzo was bad today also enzo i dont know what its like the way he color like his haircut now he looks like cole palmer on the pitch its annoying to me like i was trying to like maybe my tv just isnt big enough fernandez looks no i dont in general no cole palmer is possibly the most distinctive looking person in the premier league but for some reason when they were on the pitch today there were like three or four times when i thought that i thought it was cole palmer and then i was like thats enzo with the ball so i think he i think hes he got like a different haircut so you thinking of the right like enzo fernandez came on like as a substitute very la late in the match who knows does he have blonde hair now i am i am i like totally wrong about this im going to do a google image search for the last 24 hours i genuinely cant are you confusing him with rasmuss holand perhaps no im not i dont know well solve this mystery maybe who maybe i thinking of somebody else i dont know like little im gonna do some di baff well find well figure this out so but on forest so you brought in chris wood ana who youve been like he i know i joke often say this but like he is your boy this season like youve been youve been big uping him all year and so he he gets the goal i think he ended up with three bonus points as well in the match so their defense looks strong midfield i dont know morgan gibs whites in battling some injuries and so its hard to recommend him but hudson adoy has sneakily been pretty good this season and let me see just let me pull him up real quick here as were as were talking hes now the top midfielder for forest hes got its just its just two goals and one assist so its not like mindblowing but i dont know i just feel like the way theyre clicking right now there might be some interesting options there i maybe its it honestly might just be wood and anar are the only two you want to consider although sells as a as a as a cheap keeper like if i could go back and do my wild card again and in fact when you wild card brandon i think sals would have to be someone youd consider right 4m ill take anyone like its the first goalkeeper to get in line like you play that game when youre a kid like last one to get to your knee like that is it right first goalkeeper to touch and knee is my go keeper hes got hes racked up an assist so far this season hes got four clean sheets lets see hes got six bonus points he honestly hes probably been one of the one of the better cheap keepers that you could have this year seon so im up on forest im rooting for them i also like their red color brandon i maybe just like red squads but i think aesthetically theyre like a fun squad like theyre fun squad to watch in this year i think in general i like to watch most of the teams in the premier league this year like outside of southampton i feel like the thing about lester like in its like youre talking about like benching dap for that match and i do get it because theyre not exactly pushing overs like they dont they concede goals but like every match they play is like so unpredictable its like you dont know its a little bit like what you that feeling you get when youre in a fpl headtohead league and you have to play average that week i feel like when you play lester this season its like going against the fpl average youre like i should win this like but i dont know i dont know and im going to lose more than i expect so so i think i dont know i think that like theyre theyre theyre an interesting team im just gonna hold vardy by the way for a while like i dont i dont see any reason to like if i could make an easy move to wood at some point ill do it but otherwise like how much does cost these days hes like 56 something like that nothing right so i wouldnt even necessarily recommend buying him like they play away to man united in game we 11 but all right so like im just moving through my little my talking points for todays match brandon what did you think about gardial by the way 62m so hes very pricey in general we have not been getting a lot from keepers this season but bonus in the last match goal theres something about the left back spot for man city it does seem to be a spot where i think maybe especially with kyle walker when he plays right because hes so strong defensively that maybe that its a spot where you could get a little bit more like he to me hes probably the second and maybe honestly the only the one other player you can have on man city right now outside of outside of holland right its its a mess otherwise it is hes a strange fantasy ass head guardio because you are relying on him getting attacking returns because i thought he had a poor defensive match and just city nothing needs to be said beyond theyve been horrible defensively all season but he but he has this pension for popping up and getting attacking returns and its like how much are you willing to spend because he doesnt get attacking returns the way a lot of fullbacks do like the trent alexander arnolds of the world like hes never hes i dont think ive ever seen vardal cross the ball but hes certainly looking to get on the end of a onew or on the ac cross so i like him right hes more of a goalscoring fullback than a like hes not hes not andy robertson right hes got like a very different hes a sheamus coleman we could say hes hes more hes hes more a sheamus coleman than a leighton baines okay well if he was on pens maybe he could be a he could be a well why not why not why not so lets see hes got on the season safars g got three goals and no assists those three goals have come in the last five matches so hes like i dont know i dont know like i statistically i dont know how to like talk about streakiness or whatever but he has been a very streaky asset in fantasy we saw this last season as well right where he put in a lot of good performan like he passed the eye test right like when you watched him in these man city matches it was like w this guy is like all over the ball hes getting hugely advanced positions like and but he also had this run of 10 plus matches like that like last season where he just got no attacking returns right just nothing and he was expensive and this season the same way the first five weeks of the season no goals and no assists and now hes got three goals in his last five with a u a clean sheet and three bonus thrown in as well right and the three bonus comes at least a little bit from the threat that he was providing right on the like you said i dont i much like trent im rarely impressed with his defensive capab it was weird in the liverpool match there was some moment where trent like gave the ball away in a bad spot and the announcers were like unusual for trent i was like i dont think so thats what you pay for so i think with guardio hes the fantasy asset that you stumble backwards into like in just in the right game week it feels right and you go for it i cant see any like grander plan involving guardal like why you would like he would be a part of a team you were you were constructing over the course of a month that a thing because i think where were at right now is like trying to get as much extract as much money out of our defense as possible because theres no real value there now you have you have and trent at this point whats the deal there its not going to last and but i think at the moment it is tricky because one of the other talking points this week was that we had these great performances from the popular cheap midfielders right rogers with a goal and two bonus sania with a goal and three bonus even bernon johnson came through with a goal and u its it feels like a little polarized in terms of like youre getting returns from the five million guys and the 12m guys and its like you dont want to have like a 9m midfielder right or like even like a 9m forward like ive had hins the last few weeks and hes been hugely disappointed right and it feels like hes foden hes my foden exactly hes my hes my rushmore brandon and so thats thats thats whats happening with me right now i thought brenan johnson hes like talk about a player is past the eye test he he does look good in these matches and probably overdue to get a goal and he plays he plays leaf davis next week who loves getting roasted on brennan johnsons side talk about leaf davis the poor mans gardial right with the hes normally more of an assist guy than a goal scorer but like hes hes no ones hes no ones idea of a great defensive player but he just gets it was awesome i know it felt its a little bad for them conceding because are they still without a win on the season too i believe so yes and southampton did pick up their first win too a a close one with that i that side decision was tight i dont know if you saw the moleno just getting robbed of fpl points people always complain about so theres all this like esoteric fantasy crap like bonus point systems and and like where am i holding midfielder points what i hate i hate the fact that you get clean sheet points only to have them taken away and that just doesnt it makes everyone feel bad okay thats true they shouldnt award the clean sheet points till the game is over thats a good thats thats true because i hate i hate logging into my team when theres a clean sheet in there right i dont even like toing yourself i thought you meant he had supplied the assist for the the beta no i just wanted some clean i just wanted some points was that so much to ask it was it was so much to it was too much to ask all right well lets okay one final thing here brandon which is man united assets we get the the bruno pen we also got a holand assist right he earned the pen some clowny goalkeeping from sanchez i thought on that on that particular play you just cannot touch the player right like thats of course hes gonna dive like every you and i would dive if like a goalkeeper touches your feet you have to fall over if youre in the box thats just what you do right and so but like defensively they were i thought they were okay like they like you said they were they were up for this match and it took a a screamer right a great goal from outside the box for them to even concede anything in this match so did you come away like slightly more interested in any man united assets or did you think it was all just a well the their defense was more impressive mazari was the player who i liked the most in the match and my main issue with man utd was i thought their attack was pretty blunt and not great like garnacho was i think easily the worst player on the pitch which like i its one match and you would want to be very optimistic as a man utd supporter that things are going on the right direction and garnacho is allowed to have a bad match would i would i bank on garnacho over marcus rashford at this point probably but still it was like holand rashford garnacho i was like well this is like i dont know how far you can go with these three guys up front it feels like bruno and mazari were the guys who impressed me the most could you could you is onana gonna beat cs to the punch in my goalkeeping wild card position its their next their next i wonder if you end up talking yourself into an early wild card here brandon honestly because the trio of matches coming up for man united are probably as good as it gets right they have lester at home in gw 11 ip switch away in gw 12 and everton at home in gw 13 so its its a trio of strong matches i think i dont know its like maybe its not your particular squad brandon but like just because im talking to you like but i think like someone out there if they want to be a little bit different this probably for the first time this season br ill say this might be the time to get bruno and just and just take a punt and see if he can deliver for you because the like the chance of a like extreme return from him is never going to be higher than it is in the next three weeks right like a high ceiling return like either lester at home if such a way again like theyre unpredictable like lester especially but but unpredictability can be good in fantasy too right like you could see a bunch of goals from both squads in this match so i dont know its interest like i do think that gar i dont know like garnacho maybe holand im still i feel like the jurys still out i dont quite believe it yet but i dont know and then you have xery come on and im like im always like i forget hes there right im like like xery which is a i always want to say i always want to say xerxes by the way too like the old emperor ruler its like a or whatever right well i dont think you have to spend too much time thinking about xery youll be fine fair enough all right well lets move on here brandon why dont you give a quick patreon what do you promote our patreon i id love to and we dont want to sell it too hard every week josh and i we show up and we put this content together for you if you like what you hear if you want to say thanks and also get to be a part of what we feel is a pretty rich and rewarding fpl community on our discord we hear that all the time u people having good live match day chats joining extra mini leagues and getting up to all sorts of funny stuff on the discord plus you get an extra podcast every week at the at the highest tiers and theyre not when i say highest tiar josh theyre not that high you can go to patreoncom cheating find that tier that fits right for you but we do love those thursday night pods just for our patreon supporters with no ads we talk about our final roughly final decisions right before the deadline so check it out patreoncom cheating for more information on how you can say thanks and get more fpl content in return thats very soft sals like a like our friend lex g trying to sell his patreon most apologetic listen you can join my pat around but if you dont listen i get it i like trust me like i get it i wouldnt do it myself i would i think youre an idiot if you join my patreon nonetheless its there i will say the discord is genuinely fantastic and its like theres conversation going on all the time and its taken on a life of its own its like it does not need in fact i s feel like we gum up the works when we get in there brandon its like we do not need us around for to for to go and i also think the patreon are theyre a lot looser and more fun and i think they must be we must be happy with what with how theyre going because i feel like we often bring up stuff we talked about in the patreon pods on the main feed pod as well so if you if you want a different voice its like its like a nice way to like easier way into the weekend too because the i feel like the tone is much looser and lighter so patreoncom where you can go brandon lets now move on and take a look at gw 11 all right so game week 11 and i will share of course well well talk through it but ill share it just so you and i can be on the same page but we can so we can read from the same prayer book as you like to say yes love to say that and so this is the final game week before the next international break i know you are hoping it would come sooner brandon but dont worry youve got you got coming were almost there its they jam them in and im also sad to tell you this is the last international break i believe until march so its a nice i know exactly everybody so are your what is international champions cup head whatever they call this i dont the nations league the nations league i cant keep up with any of these things anymore brandon they get rebranded all the time and its you can tell how i feel about them just from that expression there so i they do get i will say the international breaks get better when you have stuff like world cup qualifying thrown into the mix right i think that does raise the stakes a little bit but when its just like friendlies its hard for me to stay who cares who bloody cares exactly so all right so anyway game week 11 so we have matches just on saturday and sunday its your classic post champions league europa league split bunch of matches are on sunday so u of course that is a reminder that on tuesday and wednesday we have champions league games l week games on thursday involving i think six premier league squads play at midweek so if you can hold off on your transfers unless youre tight on budget i would i would try to do so we saw just this last week with the with the league cup right which in theory should be less of a like lift but the league cup there were a bunch of people knocked out from that as a as a among them so i think that its its an interesting slate of fixtures though the one that as i talked about at the beginning of the pod that stands out to me is that spurs ip switch match and for me i just dont have anybody for that match right now and that feels like the one where i could its a little bit like the arsenal southampton match several weeks ago where i was like well maybe i can just maybe i can just skate by well i dont i have one defender in that match ill just ill just skate by and itll be fine like how bad could it be not having saka or you anybody else in that game it was terrible it was like a it was a it upended my season in some ways right i took a massive hit so i that is the one where im like i feel like i want to get into that into that attack if i can and so i am looking at salony for that one lets see southampton wolves saw south southampton the other squad where youre you want to target your fixtur if you can and i will say again strand larson continues to put in some nice performances if they i i dont find wolves to be trustworthy at all i certainly wouldnt recommend bringing in any of their assets at the moment but theyre at least like back in the conversation of getting like theyre more fantasy relevant than west ham at this point brandon so thats thats something why west ham persisting with this la pategi its its funny like at least oneal at wolver hampton like theres some theres i dont know theres no point in talking about either these teams but like wolves is the bandwagon in fpl right now kia and larson are the main guys as well so lots of fun cheap guys to choose from where west ham like the players you might want to pick up like bowen are just like too expensive for what youre getting for that team so i get it but i agree like wolves just dont like theyre just because the fixtures turned doesnt mean theyre suddenly a good outfit and i think they have so much still to prove and you dont have that one asset that like like quang chan last like what they do is score goals i think there may be they may be one of the teams thats like never theyve theyve scored in every match so far this season like lets lets see lets look at their matches scored they had scored in every match so like goals is what youre trying goals and assists is what youre trying to buy unfortunately they concede it roughly a two to one ratio i was thinking and i know this isnt super fantasy either but i just because its on my mind i was thinking watching that because that was the arsenal failed to score against him anyway sorry okay nine out of 10 then but it was the fe the featured match for some reason on saturday was this wolves palace game and so i was watching it and i was thinking about whether because both the goals they were just like theyre so shaggy defensively and its like and i was wondering im like is that on oneal and if so if it if it is on him like you like you have to sack him right its like or its like or its like a talent thing but its like if you thought that he was at fault for theyve been so bad defensively that he would have to go like i so i feel like its not like im saying that because i dont know that it is him but its like its feels weird that theyre so poor defensively yes you would think that yes the manager might be able to turn the screws there tighten it up a bit and its being sacrificed but maybe the club just says our only ambition this season given the circumstances of 17th place and right just given like how much it would cost us to sack oneal and we probably wouldnt get any like anybody remarkably better give him give him like a this good fixture run like i expect if wolves are still like firmly in the relegation zone after this run through like the end of the year then hell be sacked for sure i think so too and im not advocating for sacking him i think i think in general these squads probably move a little too quickly to sa these guys but so anyway well i think we have an we have an interesting slate on saturday and sunday a very late match on saturday i love when they do this theyve been doing these a little more often brandon and late game liverpool hosting aston villa i dont know what to think about aston ville anymore its its a real like i hate i hate this cliche but its like a tale of two hales situation right like first half its they look scoring a set piece look pretty strong defensively second half they can siege four and im like i dont know quite what to make of them right now i think theyve been bit by the same bug as newcastle when they got to the champions league that to thin and also just like the learning curve to be fighting on those fronts and the onana coming into the midfield and of douglas louise i think is like its a good signing but i just dont think its clicked fully and i think that does weaken their just like what theyre trying to do transitionally and he he went off as well didnt he or maybe he just got hurt i cant remember if he went off in the match in the end hold on im pulling up the match tracks cuz i dont i dont recall as well i have rogers off injured no onana stayed on the pitch the entire time okay he did because i remember at one point he got like walloped by somebody but and so i think that should be a fun match though regardless im looking forward to liverpool villa its i have i dont know like do you think that youll captain salah this week again its between salah and holland theres theres no great science to it salo is my bus team captain but brighton there are there are reasons why we used salah to target brighton this week they have injuries and they do play very open so can holland just like pull the finger out can he start finishing some chances if so because i dont know the big brain way of thinking of holland right now is wow maybe hes an edge to like be the last person who has faith enough to captain holland so i dont hate the brighten away fixture for holland and as youre saying like i also do not hate borderline i like the home fixture against villa fala i think that makes sense and like how different is this conversation of holland just converts that massive chance he has late in the vmou match id probably like c defin i id definitely be bus team holland all the way in that situation for sure it just it feels like its like reflective though of a little bit of its like its on the one hand sure its unlucky and the other hand its like reflective of him just not hes just not smashing the ball the way he does when hes like in good form right and fill confidence the chances just arent that good and theres theres just too many crosses that hes being asked to convert cuz hes terrible in the air unless like hes unless hes doing like a scissor kick like there is just not enough space for holland i think that this is why another reason to just get rid of fod in asap because de bruyne is seems crucial to help hollen find that space theres something about i dont know if its something to do with rodery not being there like that but its like i feel like the holland thrives and i think kdb and rodri have both been good at finding him in these spaces we like hes like halfway in between the center circle and the opposition goal right and its like if you can get him in the ball with space like in that in that area he is so good i feel like driving forward and using his speed and i feel like but the way the matches have been going and i im maybe its just because the ball is getting more clogged up midfield and so the other team isnt comm committing as many players forward and so theyre able to get back and stop these stop these chances im not sure but well c just have the ball all the time and third they doing nothing they have the ball all the time and theyre scoring like a goal a game its like its its its so its just not and so he just hes in the box constantly right it just like its like he turns into like some tony pus forward right just like waiting for something to that he can put his head on right and like thats i dont i agree that hes hes not thriving in this current role so but with that said i think i agree i think its like its pretty close between holland and salah other salanki as a captaincy feels a little like a little too like what have you done for me lately sun i wouldnt mind if you had son in your squad i think sun if a i just feel like i all these memories over the years of sun captain sun for these like easy fixtures and him like not because he is so good on the counterattack right and hes so good at like converting these low xg chances and soon as i feel like when theyre playing a team that theyre just like clearly better than its it doesnt suit his you just gave me a great idea like all these optimal stats and predictive models for fantasy i want a model thats just sheerly based on your memory hey how about how about this for an idea by the way this is not related to what you just said but why dont you why dont you use this other transfer to bring in sun this week and then wild card and gw 12 why dont you have sun for this for the ip switch fixture and then like like pl to dead end your team and wild card into the next game week i game week 12 is already a good time to wild card anyway so thats thats an interesting im im not convinced that sun is a worthwhile fantasy asset i did just outline all the reasons not to necess but im just saying like its its an interesting strategy i think that there is some like it could work right because sure and gw 12 over the international break is a fantastic time to wild card because arsenal do have that huge fixture turn and cole palmer becomes like even more like his fixtures are even more enhanced as well so lots of different teams that you want to jump on so i dont hate treating gw 11 as like a wild punt a game wake i get it especially because i dont i dont think that palmer is like super essential for game 11 anyway right because even with arsenal flailing a little bit i dont see chelsea scoring like three goals in this match right i think its gonna be he they may score one and he scores that goal but i just dont see it as like a like a wide openen game maybe im wrong about that but i know i dont know what to make of it either i think its going to resemble a lot of what we saw in the chelsea man utd match today i think it might look pretty similar to that and then i thought chelsea just like didnt call upon their attacking prowess enough which it was odd like they just didnt show what they could do nicholas jackson was like incredibly anonymous until i realized he got a yellow card and im just like how does this guy always somehow find a way to get a yellow card even when you dont even see him on the pitch its very funny to me but i dont know but having foden going into gw 11 also feels like and these just like bitter tears of fod and just being a complete dud the last couple of weeks does feel like like hes a waste of a spot in a fantasy squad for one week and that does feel way too passive for me like yes as you say like foden could doesnt have to become palmer he could become anyone playing these fixtures he could become brennan johnson for that matter right lets see who are the who would be like the other plum fixture like southampton who w wolves i it would probably be lina whats that l bring in lamina mario jr as hes now called on the website its mario jr honestly like you could you could look at bruno as a again it just it just brun like i think theres like a quite good chance he gets some attacking return in that lester match so again its its a luxury for you a little bit just because you have this wild card that you could maybe punt and maybe try to get one up on other managers right like thats the advantage of having that wild card still is you can you can always and also they play if switch in 12 so it doesnt you wouldnt you wouldnt be dead ending with him so i know its an interesting thought well then thats another reason for me to just like punt on the wild card bring in bruno and the dont play the wild card as we all know bruno fernandez solves all fantasy problems always has always will all right we got a couple questions here brandon lets get into them i think i have i have two questions that ive selected one is from fpl brooklyn arsenal have just not been clicking offensively or defensively should we stick for their gw 12 fixture swing so this is the this is a key question i think at this point its interesting i thought their lineup against newcastle was pretty solid bar acknowledging that odard is out right their defense was there were lots of injury concerns and i thought they had a pretty strong defense that they lined up with so its like its not a personnel issue there just seems to be a real mental block and thats the thing thats the root of the question is do good fixtures help even the most depressed team and arsenal seem depressed answer yes okay for the record i do think that like defensively thats the thing thats like giv me a little bit of pause theyre like theyre certainly like their numbers are still fine defensively but it does feel like i dont its just a weird time with them because you dont have that like one and thats what like if youre if youre like okay like just to look at the whole team saka yes like i think that saka is fine regardless a fixture we saw that last week too right gw nine and he had one blank and newcastle away its always a tricky fixture especially whatever reason for arsenal right theres just like these certain i dont know why theres certain squads that just seem to struggle with certain teams right its like it feels like for a long time it was like man city and crystal palace had this like weird but when arsenal go to newcastle its just always a tough match and so it seems like newcastle are like especially up for it and so i think long term hes still a buy i think you could buy him as soon as soon as this chelsea match and itd be fine defensively though i think it is a little bit trickier because you its just its gabrielle right and thats it like at this point i wouldnt rebi celba i dont think thats i will long term like i think hes fine but like i would i would go gabriel first if i was going that way but again its just like they dont feel super solid at the moment and theyre coning a lot of goals and so youre like bringing him in the hopes that you get like they get a bunch of set pieces right and he can like get his head on one which is which is like a an argument for him like for sure like im not diminishing that but i dont know its like outside of saka theres no one id be excited to bring in right now theyre theyre the man city defense right now is they will they will make one or two huge mistakes this arsenal defense a match at this point and i theres theres something going on there and hs hovert saka i think are they will get their points a huge concern with the arsenal attack is just like how bad trer and martinelli have been just last couple weeks so trer in particular this weekend was quite poor but theres just no magic anywhere else in the team right now in the midfield like r rice and god i can moreno i never remember that guys name m moreno theres just not a huge amount of dynamism in that partnership yet i think there will be this is like this arsenal team is built for next season as far as im concerned well its just like i there was like at some moment when like it was like dean rice like does his best to try to create a goal by himself and im like is this like a problem is this like an actual problem that needs to get solved at this point which is that delan rice like doesnt want to be a defensive midfielder anymore and its like is this like is there a connection its a great player but his setpiece delivery was complete was horrible against newcastle im just like are could they be creting better chances if he wasnt like solo in it where hes like im going to run in im going to be like vintage yaya t not but hes not doing thats just commentators loving like the the handsome pristine looking englishmen irish maybe so i feel like i feel like i like im seeing a little too much of it myself but i dont know i just i just i somethings going on with that defense and im not quite maybe its just i dont know its only 10 weeks right its its still a cliche alert here brandon but its still a small sample right like i think i think by the second half of the season man city and arsenal will have figured it out well be seeing a bunch of one nil and two nil matches right i think thats thats thats whats coming so for better or worse for worse that whats whats fun about that well so long as liverpool continue winning then youve got you theres theres the drama absolutely the be drama like in terms of the table but i just mean like i do feel like weve seen the last couple years a bunch of these matches where its like they have you have two highly motivated teams playing a bunch of teams that like are locked into their spot right and so its just like one nil two nil one n two i gota all right last questions from neymar butland brandon he says this is more of an existential question at what point do you stop and ask yourself the question what is my team i feel as though ive been following so many pieces of advice and adding so many random players who im not sure about or not watch play with my own eyes yes i want to make fantasy fun again yes but i also want to make my own team my team again 100 how do i do that the answer is quite evident i think is you have to stop all non always cheating content st seeking advice taking advice looking at other peoples team the whole the whole when fantasy content and discussion is at its best and its something we strive for we dont always achieve is what lets talk about fantasy in terms of how much did you have a good week a bad week did you watch any matches was it cool i dont want your excel okay i dont this isnt not like a this is not meant to be spirited rant baseball was better before moneyball like anyway this i know what you mean now this question resonates with me because i find myself in this position all the time like foden just to he is like my example for everything on this episode that was a decision that i made without necessarily look looking at for advice or consulting any tables or anything like that like i did it was all me and still when i look at my team right now theres something about the aura that it puts out that doesnt feel like something that i necessarily wanted or would missing a six million goalkeeper is right i me come on you gota if thats your calling card you got to honor its like the who are the water bandits or who are the guys in home alone the wet bandits the wet bandits they had the argument like we cant turn the water on cuz thats how theyll catch us and hes like no but we got to have a calling card so even if its like is to your detri to be fair joe pesi who didnt want to do that was validated in the end right because they said we found all these we have all these other crimes where they did the same thing so now we can retroactively well its fine that character did get his come up in the hit movie casin which we talked about last week i think it was crazy what they did to the wet bandits in that cornfield thats true daniel stern hes in the you cant see him but he go into that he goes into that shallow gra first i think that would be incredible if it was part of cino was part of the home alone universe g in the same time its very possible but like i think its i think youve got to make sure that there is your dna in your team otherwise youre 100 going to be not going to have fun unless youre like winning the fpl and thats thats hard thats a tight rpp i think you just this was me a year or two ago and the answer is you just have to drastically reduce your amount of consumption i think of fantasy content again i hope you continue to listen to this podcast if youre an hour in then you then i think youre a youre a fan or a support or whatever but like theres a lot of like i just dont spend time on twitter anymore that was the way that i solv this right like i just i was just on there too much i was watched many teams and i it just gets in your head and then its its honestly like theres a bit of like fear of missing out right youre just like ah man like everybodys going for this player if he if he delivers and and im on here all day on saturday or whatever im just gonna be kicking myself and feeling like im the biggest idiot for not doing that but if youre not on these spaces all day then that stuff cant hurt you right and and so i think thats you can go the other way and be like like when they when they dont do well i get to have shot for or whatever but like thats not like the greatest emotion either right like its its its not like the healthiest way to be like im just like playing to root against people or whatever right so right its like better to just like again this is like a big theme for us this year but its like focus on your mini leagues like like focus on that worry about that world and then its like what are the what are the people in your mini leagues what do their squads look like right like maybe youve got to be the one who sends the email every week or gets the the mini league mate dossier and distributes it right like the way you do brandon twice you do it for two different leagues i love i love my mini league mates exactly and its like so like invest in that stuff and then i think it doesnt matter so much like you wont worry so much about whether you have like the right players or the right template or whatever practically speaking though how do you make sure you have good players you like who are still good fantasy assets so its its all well and good to say well just fill your team with guys you like and thats how you end up with like adam wharton in your team i think like youve got to use you like well you have to like you have to be like a little bit of strategically smart about some of this stuff right you got to have some common sense and i think i will say though that even though ive reduced my consumption im still i you i have two different like fpl review which we talked about in this podcast before and ml talk them these like services where they just like produce numbers right and believe me like i am not just like picking the stuff thats thats thats generated from there nor are you right we certainly talk about them and theyre interesting but that at least always gives me a but like listen like theyve had bruno has been at the top of these charts for like 10 weeks right so like clearly like it is not for like months sa for so long as well right just has been doing nothing he got an assist last week and so but there that at least i think gives you like a little baseline right like the mel talk thing i think its like 199 right its like nothing and then you like and then you can at least like pull up a little data chart be like okay because its like a like okay i see like maybe i should look at these five players just because theyre all at the top of the chart and they werent necessarily on my radar and then you look and youre like ah right its like its like man united right where youre like i didnt realize they played lester if switch and everton in the next three right and so maybe i should be considering them more seriously stuff like that for sure all right you can do this i think by christmas your team will have a little bit more flavor im sure of it neymar butland also change your change your fantasy team name to neymar butland fc i think that sounds like sounds a b like leroy jenkins doesnt it leroy jenkins all right brandon lets wrap things up here thank you so much for listening i am feeling by the way that fall forward all of a sudden its hit like a like a like a brick just one brick not a ton of bricks but ones big bri like a huge brick right and cant be a loadbearing maybe it is the maybe its the one loadbearing

16,alwayscheating,JJYxA73zrMw,"Haaland Fire Sale, Remarkable Wood, Solanke&#39;s Surge, and Our GW11 FPL Preview",2024-11-04T03:48:25Z,[Music] [Applause] hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is Josh I'm here with Brandon Brandon how are you I'm all right Josh slow you know I'm a little worried because it's it's we have we fell back Brandon we in America this this you know last night was our fallback so for us we are actually recording this uh after nine I mean it's 8:00 on the on the you know on the the official clock Brandon but my my body clock is telling me that it's 9:08 p.m. right now so we see see how we how you know what our stamina is like as the evening goes on here I don't know if I'm feeling tired because we uh we think it's later than it is or if I'm feeling tired just watching my rank remain exactly the same every week yeah I sort of um I've caught up with you uh but well you I mean okay like I guess let's just get right into it then shall we you know because I think I yeah I think you want we we fell back into our classic patterns uh this week uh for for good or for ill I have been I have been aggressive this season and uh it has backfired sometimes and it has worked out sometimes right and it's sort of like uh they sort of they've kind of neutralized like depending on like where this weekends up I'm I'm probably going to be at my highest rank since game week three and that was right when I decided to take it and make an ultra aggressive Wild Card Brandon Wild Card had a lot of high performers for a lot of low performers right it it seemed like a good idea at the time uh and uh so I've sort of you know like I'm like Jerry Seinfeld BR i' I've come out in the middle somehow here so you know you are now like you know it's been seven weeks since then where how are you feeling you feel like you're kind of stuck in place after uh 11 it's not over yet there's still one I do feel stuck I can certainly easily pinpoint what the problem has been it was really I've lost two weeks to Phil foden and remember we did a patreon pod before like the gameweek nine deadline and I was contemplating uh Chris Wood and guardal in or uh I ended up going with moleno and Phil foden which you did on the pod in time like I maybe that's a dangerous game right there is the the real time transfer I don't know if you you know maybe you maybe you were concerned about Radiance Brandon and it was it was a you know it was like a a season ending Cliffhanger I will sacrifice my overall rank to get those numbers up for sure no I don't think it was a bad idea at the time I mean foden was certainly coming back into the City squad City it cuts both ways like V Space became more secure because of injuries and form became has become quite poor because in Man City we're about to play Southampton at home right going into game week nine like it's not I don't think you have to retroactively uh bang your head against the wall too much he also had a very good match in game week nine um but better I think in nine than in 10 I I I haven't looked at his like the underlying performance uh from foden it was was one of I was I was watching multiple matches on Sunday I saw him miss a pretty good chance I feel like it was in the first half but I I I assume you you more closely than me so what did you think about foden well yeah I mean he was fine yes he didn't have as many clear-cut opportunities for fantasy points than he did against Southampton and City just they they looked worse this week certainly they could not really create any big chances and what chances they made Holland Chief among them it just really couldn't finish them at all and Holland was was quite poor now I don't want to get to like morose about that transfer two weeks ago because there is always a ripple effect over the course of a month plus and so what I what where I'm at right now with the foden move is uh if if I had done the gardiol wood move a couple weeks ago I would be in incredible shape right now because gardel's hit in those two weeks as his wood however I wouldn't be in a position to for free this week get uh triple premium so now I'm just totally enamored of the triple premium and I would have if I I have already done HS to Wood uh and now I can for free on exact money do uh fod in to Palmer and so now I can like I'm in that I'm heading into that gameweek W transfer window of just like looking at a in awe at my team which is honestly never where you want to be because that's usually when when things kind of go but I the just to finish that point I wouldn't be able to get Palmer right now if I had done those other moves so it's an interesting fantasy conundrum of would you trade those points for the last two weeks to get your optimal team at the moment well and we're about to be I you know I'm glad you brought up the um the premium situation because I think that was really you know if there was like a kind of big talking point in in fantasy this week um and one that I think I kind of came to late I was a little reluctant to embrace it and it was it was do we just kind of give up on Holland at the moment like is there enough kind of chaos at Man City with all of the injuries we sort of joked on the patreon Pol last week about Pep's really grumpy press conference right where he was like I don't know everyone's on the everyone's getting a massage right now they're all you know on the train whatever I've got nine players or whatever this like once a year pep has like a a press conference like this right where he's like we have no money we have no you know it's a sort of like he can't help it right but I it's fine we all you wonder though I mean it it is positive that that's Pep's actually he's communicating to his team in that moment of like I'm I see what's going on here and I'm even going to communicate through the press to you that like get it together you it's not that bad I guess so but to me it's like it feels like more Deus than that right it's kind of like I don't know like we'll see if we can scratch out a point this weekend with with our with our Mash unit you know so and and and they and they didn't uh they they got seano which was uh pretty awesome I mean I have been in the Antoine seano fan club for uh well I mean I don't know for a year right like it has beened for multiple Seasons but going back to last season I thought he was he was fantastic he sort of um lost a little bit of um I feel like he didn't really have the spotlight last year because he was sort of in a um sort of complimentary role to Dominic salanki who who also had a great season for Bournemouth uh but Sano was this this right wing who was just kind of making all sorts of things happen down the stretch for for Bournemouth last season and even with uh sank Gan and Evan nson coming in he he's still doing that and I it's sort of interesting because uh you know it's I don't know it's like I I don't really know if I'm going to he may not even stay in my team uh because there are actually so many uh sort of cheap midfielders and I have to kind of decide between him and Morgan Rogers I think if if I'm going to go with the with the thrum uh the three mum approach which I'm leaning towards as well by the way U but you know at the moment um I don't know I I you know there's a couple of injuries too we've got like you know Palmer's flagged now and Morgan Rogers is flagged and we need to see where these guys are um over the next couple days they both should be fine I me Morgan Rogers it was like it was like I I couldn't tell if he just got kicked one too many times right because he went down once right like right around the 60th minute I remember because I was like watching the CL I I was I did you start Rogers this week as well I did yeah yeah yeah so I I was like watching the clock I'm like wait is he going off here too cuz it was like 5940 when he was on the ground and then he went down a second time and that's when they took him off about 10 minutes later so I I think he's probably fine it's like the classic knock right um contact injury yeah and I didn't even see what happened with Palmer um nor I played the full 90 played the full 90 but now he's he's got a flag on the site too so we'll see what what the deal is there it could be one of these like Chris Wood style injuries right where Chris Wood um it was like it seemed like he was going to be fine and he was right like in general there's like there's there really are two kinds of 75% Flags right there's the like seems like they're fine should be fine and the 75% flag that's really more like zero out for six months man yeah like yeah exactly like e like e was was 75% exactly like yeah they were 75% until the manager definitively came out and said that they were um I don't know you like never see a 50% flag anymore I feel like you know like it's yeah it's like 50% and 25% like those it's our it's our polarized climate now Josh it's it's everything's very black and white either you're on one side or the other either you're injured or you're not yeah interesting you think there's flag hurting going on like this pole hurting I keep I keep about they they want everything to be 75% yeah maybe so uh but anyway just to get back to the premium thing for a second because I think it it really was interesting uh and the question was basically um I think for a lot of us we were debating between Salah and Holland you had Salah already so it was a little easier for you to just sort of stick with with Holland I would have done the same thing if I had um if I had Holland uh but not having Salah and and wanting to sort of long-term make this move to have three premiums and if you want to sort of get into that we talked about it for like a half hour on last week's pod right so we don't think we need to rehash it go through all of it again but I think basically the idea is that it does seem like virtually every week there's going to be um three out of four of these guys are going to you know deliver mhm interestingly this was the week where it was just one right it was yeah just just Salah and if you uh had Salah and you captained him he just got nine points which isn't that much but nine points you know with a Holland blank feels huge right and so I think that was really I I I don't think many people have no Sol or Holland I mean it's possible but I think um most people have one of the two and so you saw I think a big contrast in returns and if you just had solent Captain him that was probably enough for you to be in a gray or green arrow you and I actually both have I I believe three players in the Monday match right yeah right yeah I have Smith row you have rul and then uh we both have Momo and Robinson so I guess we're we're rooting for mass chaos in the Monday night fixture yeah I forget who did you bench to uh to bring you started uh give or um uh you started um your full did you who did you bench that you could start your Fulham midfielder yeah I ended up benching Liam deap so that I could start Emil Smith row so you know when we talked on Thursday night with our patreon supporters my thought was well this Lester fixture is is Choice that's like that's grade a beef for leam deap and the more I just thought about it the more uh like my my real uh just like like confidence in IP switch is like fully waning and I just decided to trust that and then also go for the fun of having as many players as possible in the final fixture of of the game we and also like roll with my Fen boys so uh obviously I'm thrilled that I made that choice and then I had Kaa The other choice I had to make this weekend was Kaa or Pedro poro am I defense and I opted to bench Kaa and then Villa are first to score and I think yet again I've blown it but you know I I won in the end Josh one point from poro instead of Zero from Kaa so take that as a win I know that's always the L like when you when the cona thing was like when that that late goal and you're like well who does that really help you know I mean obviously salanki owners but then it was like well it hurts the cona starters they lose they lose a extra point from that so um yeah I think it was really interesting weekend so what I ultimately ended up doing and I'll I'll share my team here just that we can we can talk through it a a little bit um is uh I did end up making the move um it's funny I actually went on uh I I went and and and kind of like apologized on um on our Discord because I was like listen I didn't talk about this move at all uh you know on last night's pod where we talked about our moves for a half hour because I just really was extremely reluctant to part ways with Holland and I I ultimately decided it was worthwhile to do it um just because um I I it was kind of the only way I could get to Saka as well right and so I'm sort of thinking it was like a move that was sort of made with gameweek 12 in mind right which is when the fixtur finally get a little bit better for um for Arsenal and I think for you it's it's a little different because you still have a wild card to play right and so for you you don't have to be thinking longterm quite it's so funny I'm like setting myself up for all of these like perfect moves meanwhile I have a wild card where I could just do it whenever I wanted yeah what is are you thinking you might just yeah you might just not use it like uh you might just hold off and uh listen I just like sometimes I like to flex and uh Hey listen I put it in the comments if you want to see Brandon not play his uh wild card I want to hear from you yeah so I am uh I'm on 48 on the week so far and um yeah it's you know it's I so I brought in garal and that has worked out extremely well because I was debating between garal and Lewis and you could certainly make it a uh the the case for Lewis is basically that he's you know 1.3 million cheaper and uh uh you know felt like he was fairly locked into the squad but H not so fast right Kyle Walker comes back in uh gets the uh Captain's armband uh the real life one not the fantasy one uh and and then to make things even worse Rico Lewis comes on as a late sub right so you're sort of getting the like the nightmare scenario uh for you know if you're a Lewis owner um whereas gardial gets uh clean sheet and three bonus last week and then uh scores a goal he like didn't even celebrate the goal like that was it was the classic like I don't even know like I guess I guess this is good you know because they they were down two-nil and he wanted to you get rest rolling it's a he's a soldier of fortune gual he's just out there to do a job and make sure points like a Hess troop in the Revolutionary War branded I like it yeah so he's a oh I like that let's start calling gardial the hes on this PO you know moving for yeah so gavard and um so but I did I dropped uh Holland for Raul um I I considered salanki that was the sort of algo recommended move in Brandon score one for the alos because uh in the first in the first half of that Spurs match I was like yeah see no salani this is like you know this this is this is smart this is wise like us man yeah exactly humans went I'm watching these games okay I know not to get salani uh you know like smash cut to the end of the match where he's got two goals and an Assist U and looked looked great too like a totally completely different player um and he ends up up 16 points so r no pressure tomorrow uh just outscore Dominic sanki 16 points and will be good um but yeah so Rogers came through that with nine Jamie VY who lowkey has actually been fine like totally fine as a as a as my cheap forward um I got five points from him this week a really nice assist actually too in the IU goal um and Jordan iio by the way just hanging around like he's he's gonna be like uh Danny wellb back you're just 17 seasons in he's still gonna be getting getting minutes you know for these squads uh not necessarily a starter anymore but he can like you know he can come he can come in and do a job like this is you know his second uh sub appearance goal in two matches so uh so yeah but I got a a an assist from bardy got a goal and two bonus last week and a goal the week before that so um you perfectly respectable returns for for a sub6 million forward um and uh yeah Watkins blanks and I think that's really you know looking ahead to gameweek 11 I think that's really where my brain is and I have to say Brandon I did not think I'd be doing this on the pop but I also didn't think I'd be dropping Holland uh last week so uh Watkins to Dominic salanki looms as a possible game week 11 transfer what's your uh you know Watkins is about to price drop in the next hour while we pod do you have do you have room wiggle room there yeah he rose in price after I bought him so he's at N I bought him at 9 he's at 91 now so it would just you know it wouldn't matter um and uh so Watkins to salanki um Spurs play I switch uh in gameweek 11 makes some logical sense I'd like to wait a couple of days to do it if I could because uh uh they do have a Europa League match on Thursday so ideally I would I would wait until after that we'll see how the price changes you know I i' would probably take one point1 change like another one on the chin uh I don't know if I'd take two right and so and so but I think that would feel like a fairly logical move I also have because I made this Holland switch um and and BR and Salah it actually freed up like something like three million if I do Watkins to salani that would give me enough Mo enough money to move either Sano or Rogers to Saka in gameweek 12 so so it kind of like the moves almost kind of pick themselves I feel like right I mean you know barring any serious injuries I think that feels like a pretty logical move for gameweek 11 is just boom Watkins to salani right target tot home match great fixture and the fixtures coming up for Spurs too are really enticing some people will be thrown off by the Man City away fixture in gameweek 12 but you know they've got two home pictures with IP switch and fulam on either side yeah followed by Bourne myth like a salanki return home you know that's just got narrative written all over it yeah that's true it's like it could go could go either way right it's like uh a non- celebration I feel like no matter what right and then the two F the two tough matches following that uh Chelsea and then Liverpool with Southampton those two tough matches are both at home for Spurs so I feel like they're going to take a ton of Confidence from this Villa result this weekend you know after after like going through a rough patch feels like a good time to have Spurs assets yeah and what do you I mean I know neither of us have been and I should say we have not been super high on Spurs salanki I think you and I were both big fans of Bournemouth Salan right and so it just hasn't quite he hadn't quite clicked for for Spurs had some injuries uh also hadn't really shown um a particularly high ceiling right uh for for Spurs so far and um uh does one half kind of wipe all that away like you know what do you think about now today's match I don't I mean how could it it can't possibly like what we've seen of solank at Spurs beyond that one half has been Mr back to goal uh scarce scant chances but it could just be as simple as playing you know more expansive uh ambitious team like Aston Villa to open up the Play a little bit more yeah there was a little bit more space on the wings and and that just really favored salanki so it just he could just be a fixture player uh perhaps but um you know just looking at the way managers are jumping having held kept the faith with salanki he's absolutely an asset to continue Keeping the Faith with just given like if it's working for Spurs it's going to work a lot and his ceiling is like so I think what we discovered this weekend is sani's ceiling is a lot higher than we would have thought and it's it's still unclear what floor is yeah and I think it's it's his price is low enough that you don't have to move everything right you don't have to completely shift your team around to bring him in and so I do think he's um I hate to be like the prisoner of the moment like this but I don't know when a when a forward scores a brace and has one of the worst defenses at home in the next match it's those moves are pretty simple sometimes right um like you don't have to overthink it too much and then the question is really just do you wait until Friday to make the move or you just go ahead and and pull the trigger early so um did you say you already made your moves for game week 11 or well I did not make a transfer heading into this weekend so I have two free and I've already moved HTS to Wood because I have exact money to do this move to do HTS to Wood and fod in to Cole Palmer okay so I've done one half of it to catch the chriswood price rise and now I have 0.1 to give on foden but I can't okay uh manage the price for as I'm Palmer so I'm just watching that and I will there's there's no real sense of me waiting too long if there's news about Palmer's Fitness and of course uh BB in the YouTube chat made a good point it was was that Martinez challenge at the end of the Manchester United match where he caught Palmer on the knee and um oh he's fine then I me he like played the rest I mean he like had a chance uh shortly after that so I I think it's fine right so there there's really no reason for me to hold off because Co p won't be playing midweek cuz he's not on the the the Chelsea team sheet for for Europa just yet so anyway those I mean what is Phil foden gonna do in the Champions League to make me be like wow I've got a hold of him seeing de bruyne on the bench for Man City with like foden's got to go like immediately now I don't even know if he's even going to play nor is there any reason to keep him and an Arsenal fixture for Chelsea uh obviously it's tough Arsenal have a good defense but what a great time to play Arsenal like arsenal were like in like severe I don't want to be around anymore mode yeah this weekend and I think Cole Palmer just he clearly doesn't care who he's playing I think he's playing really well you know he had a kind of a downbeat match against Manchester United but um it ended up being a tricky match I think just because of the uh the manager change right I think um uh I the United players were up for it for sure they were up for it exactly and I think that that changed things a little bit he had um I guess he could have had an assist right um so yeah it just it wasn't quite his day but I I think that that match for me I I traditionally think of that especially I don't know seems like especially when man united host Chelsea that match always I know it's like the most they were saying uh today that in the today's broadcast that it's the most drawn match in the Premier League and that kind of squares up with my own memory it does feel like every time man man united host Chelsea it is like a 1-1 or nil-nil Draw and I'm I'm not quite sure why that is but let's yeah let's let's let's go back uh just for a moment to the beginning of game week 10 because uh Arsenal did stumble again they played away to Newcastle Newcastle probably played their strongest match of the season so far um and yeah another tough match for all Arsenal assets right you HTS uh with a one-pointer Saka blanked um defense uh concedes a goal I think it was like the 12th or 15th minute I can't when ESO scored fairly early in the game and um and then that was kind of it right it was sort of um um I don't know like I I I just like it's a tri I I still feel like it's going to turn around like I you know and I I I mean I at this point I guess I'm almost thinking more like in terms of fantasy results than I am like the actual team like I we' got our old Arsenal back Josh where they're playing for fourth place again and we love it such a no I don't love it I I actually hate it uh however yeah I mean who would have thought like the story this this season was going to be like I to me it was like Arsenal are finally there like they're finally G to push through and and then it like Liverpool are sort of like the not so fast like maybe we'll just steal this title and uh but you know with Man City losing today um it actually like it's it's very open still clearly right like it's it's it's I actually kind of in my head I thought Man City had already lost I I sort of was surprised um when I read that it was their first loss of the Season like they just had a couple of you know I guess they've had these like really um the draw with Arsenal the the late win um over world have we been so have we been so warped by like the last fiveish years where you can only win the title if you're basically undefeated like there were you know Barclays the the Barclays era of the Premier League has been in the air this season and let's go back where you can lose like five matches and still win the title that's exciting that's cool I I think it's cool too like I I hope we have a three-way or or more race I think that would be awesome uh the other cool story uh was uh there were actually a couple questions too about Forest uh but but forest in third place which I think is so cool like it's I think it's really um it's just fun like even kind of fantasy aside it's it's just always like every year there's kind of one team like last year it was Villa right and I I don't know that I gen genely think that Forest could get a Champions League spot but I think that they're they could they sneak into like a Europa League spot maybe I mean they have a they have a strong defense um they have some you know Callum Hudson they have players like Callum Hudson andoy who like are like highly pedigreed players right who battled sort of injury and for I mean there was a time a few years ago I don't remember this when when Chelsea were basically fending off Bayern Munich who were making a big push for for Callum Hutson M so then he kind of had this like you know it was like he was trying to get into that break into that Squad and like I was like oh like let's make him uh left wing back Hudson AO right it was like they were sort of like trying everything to make it work and and I just wonder if that kind of screwed with him a little bit it's like a you know it's like a like a baseball hitter who they're like oh like you should change your swing right so that you can uh hit more home runs like change your launch angle right and then suddenly it's like they can't they can't do anything anymore and I just wonder and last year he battled injuries on and off too uh you know what you know what also screws with your confidence when your Club buys 20 other left Wingers right exactly oh my God and I thought Enzo was bad today also Enzo I don't know what it's like the way he color like his haircut now he looks like Cole Palmer on the pitch it's really annoying to me like I was uh trying to like maybe my TV just isn't big enough Fernandez looks like no I don't in general no Cole Palmer is possibly the most distinctive looking person in the Premier League but for some reason when they were today there were like three or four times when I thought that I thought it was Cole Palmer and then I was like oh that's Enzo with the ball so I think he I think he's you got like a different haircut or something um so are you thinking of the right like like Enzo Fernandez came on like as a substitute very La late in the match um who knows does he have blonde hair now am I am I am I like totally wrong about this I'm going to do a Google image search for the last 24 hours prob I genuinely can are you confusing him with rasmus's holand perhaps no I'm not I don't know you know we we'll solve this mystery maybe who maybe I thinking of somebody else I don't know like well uh I'm going to do some di Baff yeah we'll find we'll figure this out so um yeah but on Forest I mean you you so you brought in Chris Wood yeah um ana who you've been like he I I know I jokingly often say this but like he kind of is your boy this season like you've been you've been big uping him all year and so he uh uh he gets the goal I think he ended up with three bonus points as well in the match so uh I mean their defense looks strong Midfield I don't know I mean uh you know Morgan Gibs White's in battling some injuries and so it's kind of hard to recommend him but Hudson adoy has sneakily been pretty good uh this season and um let me see just just let me pull him up real quick here um as we're as we're talking um yeah he he's now the top midfielder um uh for Forest he's got uh I mean I guess it's just it's just two goals and one assist so it's not like you know mind-blowing but um uh I don't know I I I just feel like like the way they're clicking right now there there might be some interesting uh options there I mean maybe it's it honestly might just be wood wood and Anar the only two you really want to consider although sells as a as the as a cheap uh keeper like if I could go back and do my wild card again and in fact when you wild card Brandon I think SS would have to be someone you'd consider right he's 4.6 million um I'll take anyone like it's basically the first goalkeeper to get in line like you know you play that game when you're a kid like you know last one to get get your knee or something like that it right yeah yeah first goalkeeper the touch and knee is my goalkeeper I mean he's got uh he's racked up an assist so far this season uh he's got uh four clean sheets uh let's see he's got six bonus points I mean he honestly he probably been one of the one of the better cheap Keepers that you could have this season um so yeah I'm up on Forest I'm rooting for them I also like their red color Brandon I maybe just like red squads you know but I I think aesthetically they're like a fun Squad like they're fun Squad to watch in this year yeah I think in general I actually like to watch most of the teams in the Premier League this year like outside of Southampton um I feel like uh I mean the thing about Lester like in you know it's like you're talking about like benching dap for that match and I I I do kind of get it because they're not exactly pushovers like they don't they concede goals but like every match they play is like so unpredictable it's like you really don't know it's a little bit like what you that feel you get when you're in a FPL head-to-head league and you have to play average that week I feel like when you play Lester this season it's like going against the FPL average yeah you're like I should win this like but I don't know but I don't know and I'm going to lose more than I expect yep so yeah so I think um I don't know I I think that like they're they're they're an interesting team I'm actually uh just going to hold vardy by the way for a while like I don't I don't see any reason to like I mean if could make an easy move to to wood at some point I'll do it but otherwise like how much does cost these days he's like 5.6 something like that nothing right so um you know I'm not I wouldn't even necessarily recommend buying him like they play away to man united in game 11 but um all right so like I'm just moving through my little uh my talking points for today's match Brandon um what did you think about gardial by the way he's 6.2 million so he's very pricey um in general we have not been getting a lot from Keepers this season uh uh but bonus in the last match goal I mean there's something about the the left back spot for Man City it does seem to be a spot where um I think maybe especially with Kyle Walker when he plays right because he's so strong defensively um that maybe that is a spot where you could get a little bit more I mean like he to me he's probably the second and maybe honest the only the the one other player you can have on man city right now uh outside of outside of Holland right I mean it's it's kind of a mess otherwise it is he's a strange fantasy ass at guardio because you really are relying on him getting attacking returns because uh I I thought he had a really poor defensive match and just City obviously nothing needs to be said beyond they've been horrible defensively all season um but he but he has this pension for popping up and getting attacking returns yeah and it's like how much are you willing to spend CU he doesn't get attacking Returns the way a lot of fullbacks do like the Trent Trent Alexander's Arnold of of the world like he's never he's I don't think I've ever seen vardal cross the ball um but he's certainly looking to get on the end of a onew or on the end of a cross so I like him for that right he's more of a goalscoring fullback than a like like he's not he's not um Andy Robertson right he's got like a very different kind of he's a Sheamus Coleman we could say he's he's More's he's more a Sheamus Coleman than a Leighton Baines okay yeah yeah well yeah if he was on pens maybe he could be a he could be a b why not why not why not so let's see he's got uh on the season Safari he's got three goals in no assists um those three goals have come in the last five matches so he's he's kind of I mean like I don't know I really don't know like I you know statistically I don't know how to like um talk about streakiness or whatever but he has been a very streaky asset in fantasy we saw this last season as well right where he um put in a lot of good performan like he he pass the eye test right like you when you watched him in these Man City matches it was like wow this guy is like all over the ball he's you know getting hugely Advanced positions like and and you know but it but he also had this run of 10 plus matches or something like that like last season where he just got no attacking returns right just nothing and he was you know kind of expensive uh and this season kind of the same way the first five weeks of the Season no goals and no assists uh and now he's got three goals in his last five uh with a u a clean sheet and three bonus thrown in as well right and the three bonus comes at least a little bit from the threat that he was providing right on the uh the like you said I I don't uh i r like much like Trent I I'm rarely impressed with his uh defensive capab it was weird in the Liverpool match there was some moment where Trent like gave the ball away in a bad spot and the announcers were like unusual for Tren I was like I don't think so that's what you pay for yeah yeah so I think with guial he's the kind of fantasy asset that you kind of stumble backwards into uh like in just in the right game we it feels right and you go for it I can't see any like grander plan involving guardal like why you would like he would be a part of a team you were you were constructing over the course of of a month that that sort of a thing because I think where we're at right now is like trying to get as much extract as much money out of our defense as possible because there's no real value there I mean now you have and Trent at this point uh what's the deal there it's not going to last um and uh but I think at the moment um I mean it is tricky because one of the other talking points this week was that we had these great performances from the popular cheap midfielders right uh Rogers with a goal and two bonus Sano a goal and three bonus even Brennan Johnson uh came through with a goal and um it's it feels like a little polarized in terms of like you're getting returns from the five million guys and the 12 million guys and it's like you don't want to have like a 9 million midfielder right like or even like a nine million forward like I I i' I've had Watkins the last few weeks and he's been hugely disappointing right and it feels like uh he's foden yeah he's my foden exactly yeah he's my uh he's my Rushmore Brandon uh and so so that's that's what that's what's happening with me right now um yeah I thought Brennan Johnson I mean he's like talk about a player who passed the eye test he really he does look really good in these matches and um probably overdue to get a goal and he plays uh he plays Leaf Davis next week uh who loves getting roasted on Brennan Johnson's side yeah talk about yeah Lea Davis the poor man's gardial right uh with the I mean I guess he's normally more of an assist guy than a goal scorer but but I mean like he's uh he's no one's uh he's no one's idea of a great defensive player but he just gets gets yeah oh yeah it was awesome I know I felt a little bad for them um conceding because uh are they still without a win on the season too I believe so yes yeah and Southampton did pick up their first win too kind of a kind of a close one with that I that that offside decision was really tight I don't know if you saw the meleno uh just just getting robbed of FPL points people always complain about so there's all this like esoteric fantasy crap like bonus Point systems and uh and like where am I holding midfielder points you know what I hate I hate the fact that you get clean sheet points only to have them taken away and that just doesn't it makes everyone feel bad okay that's true they shouldn't award the clean sheet points till the game is over that's a good that's that's true because I hate I hate logging into my team when there's a clean sheet in there right yeah I don't even like to cing yourself I thought you meant he had uh supplied the assist for the uh the bet no I just wanted some clean I just wanted some points oh was that so much to ask it was it was so much to it was too much to ask um all right well let's Okay one final thing here Brandon which is um man united assets we get the uh the Bruno um pen uh we also got a holand uh assist I suppose right I mean he earned the pen some really uh uh Clowny goalkeeping from Sanchez as I thought on that on that particular play you just cannot touch the player right like that's of course he's going to dive like every you and I would dive if like a goalkeeper touches your feet you have to fall over if you're in the box that's just what you do right um and so um but like I mean defensively they were I thought they were okay like they like you said they were they were up for this match and um it took a kind of a screamer right a great goal from outside the box for them to even concede anything in this match so um did you come away like slightly more interested in any man united assets or did you think it was all just kind of a well the their defense I guess was more impressive mazari was the player who I liked the most in the match and my main issue with Manchester United was I thought their attack was was uh pretty blunt and not great yeah uh like garnacho was I think easily the worst player on the pitch which like you know I it's one one match and you would want to be very optimistic as a Manchester United supporter that things are going in the right direction and garnacho is allowed to have a bad match um would I would I Bank on garnacho over Marcus rashford at this point um probably but still um it was like holand rashford garnacho I was like well this is like I don't know how far you can go with these three guys up front it feels like Bruno and Mai were the guys who impressed me the most I mean could you could you is is Onana going to beat cells to the punch in my goalkeeping Wild Card position yeah I mean it's uh I mean their next their next I mean yeah I wonder if you end up talking yourself into an early wild card here Brandon honestly because I mean the trio of matches coming up for Man United are probably as As Good As It Gets right they have um Lester at home in gameweek 11 IP switch away in gameweek 12 and Everton at home in game League 13 so it's it's a trio of really strong matches I mean I I think I don't know it's like maybe it's not your particular Squad Brandon but like just because I'm talking to you like but I I think like someone out there if they want to be a little bit different this actually probably for the first time this season BR I'll say this but this actually might be the time to get Bruno and just and just take a punt and see if he can uh deliver for you because uh the the like the chance of a like extreme return from him is never going to be higher than it is in the next three weeks right like a high ceiling kind of return like either Lester at home it such a way again like they're unpredictable like Lester especially but um but unpredictability can be good in fantasy 2 right like you could see a bunch of goals uh you know from from both squads in this match so um I don't know yeah it's I mean I guess like I do think that GAR I don't know like garnacho maybe um holand I'm still I feel like the still out I don't quite believe it yet but um I don't know and then you have xery come on and I'm like I'm always kind of um like I forget he's there right I'm like oh like xery you know which is a I always want to say I always want to say Xerxes by the way too like the old um the old Emperor ruler it's like a anent Babylon or whatever right yeah yeah um yeah well I don't think you have to really spend too much time thinking about xery you'll be fine yeah fair enough all right well let's uh move on here Brandon um why don't you uh give a quick uh patreon um promotion you promote our patreon I I i' I'd love to and you know we don't want to sell it too hard but you know every week Josh and I we show up and we we put this

uh Brandon let's now move on and take a look at gameweek [Music] 11 all right so game week 11 and I will uh share of course we we'll talk through it but I'll share it just so you and I can um uh be on the same page we can so we can read from the same prayer book as you like to say yes love to say that yeah and so this is the final game week before uh the next International break I know you are hoping uh it would come sooner Brandon but don't worry you've got uh you got one coming yeah we're almost there it's um they really Jam them in um and uh I'm I'm also sad to tell you this is the last International break I believe until March so it's a nice I know exactly everybody uh you know so are your kind of um what is International Champions Cup head whatever they call this the Nations League the Nations League I can't keep up with any of these things anymore Brandon they get rebranded all the time and it's uh yeah you can tell how I feel about them just from that expression there so I they do get I will say the international breaks get better when you have stuff like World Cup qualifying thrown into the mix right I think that that does raise the stakes a little bit but when it's just like friendlies yeah it's hard for me to stay who cares who bloody cares yeah exactly so um all right so anyway game week 11 uh so we have matches just on Saturday and Sunday it's your classic uh post champ CHS League Europa League split bunch of matches are on uh Sunday so of course that is a reminder that on Tuesday and Wednesday we have Champions League games all we games on Thursday uh involving I think six Premier League squads play at midweek so um if you can hold off on your transfers unless you're really tight on uh budget I would I would try to do so we saw just this last week with the uh with the League Cup right which in theory should be less of a like lift but the The League Cup uh there were a bunch of people knocked out uh from that as a as a among them so um yeah I think that it's it's an interesting uh slate of fixtures though I mean the one that as I talked about the beginning of the Pod that stands out to me is that Spurs ipss switch match and for me I I just don't have anybody for that match right now and um that feels like the one where I could really it's a little bit like uh the Arsenal Southampton match um several weeks ago where I was like well maybe I can just maybe I can just skate by well I don't you know I have one defender of that I'll just I'll just skate by and it'll be fine like how how bad could it be not having Saka or uh you know you anybody else in that game yeah it was terrible it was like a it was a you know upended my season in some ways right I took a massive hit and so I that is the one where I'm like I feel like I kind of want to get into that um into that attack if I can and so I I am sort of looking at salanki for that one um let's see Southampton I mean wolves saw South Southampton the other Squad where you're kind of you want to Target your fixtur if you can and uh I will say again uh St Larson continues to put in some nice performances if they I you know I I don't find wolves to be trustworthy at all I certainly wouldn't recommend bringing in any of their assets at the moment but they're at least like back in the conversation of sort of getting like they're more fantasy relevant than West Ham at this point Brandon so that's that's something I guess why West Ham persisting with this uh La pegy it's it's really kind of funny like at least O'Neal at wolver Hampton like there's some there's I don't know there's no point I'm talking about either these teams but yeah like wolves wolves is the bandwagon in FPL right now CIA and Larson are the main guys and as well um so lots of fun cheap guys to choose from where West Ham like the the players you might want to pick up like Bowen are just like too expensive for what you're getting for that team so so I get it um but I agree like wolves just don't like they're just just because the fixtures turned doesn't mean they're suddenly a good outfit and I think they have so much still to prove yeah and you don't have that kind of one asset that like um like Quang Chan last season I guess like what they do is score goals I think May there may be they may be one of the teams that's like never they've they've scored in every every match so far this season like let's let's see let's look at their their matches scored scored scored scored scored scor SC scored scored yeah yeah yeah they had scored in every match so so like goals I guess is what you're trying goals and assists is what you're trying to buy yeah unfortunately they canc it roughly a 2: one ratio I I was thinking and I know this isn't super fantasy relevant either but I just because it's on my mind I was thinking watching that because that was the um I guess Aral failed to score against them anyway sorry go ahead nine out of 10 then uh but it was the Fe the featured match uh for some reason uh on Saturday was this this w wolves uh Palace game and uh so I was watching it and I was thinking about um whether because both the gos I mean they were just like they're so Shaggy defensively and it's like and I was wondering I'm like is that on O'Neal and if so if it if it is on him like you you like you have to sack him right it's like I mean or it's like or it's like a talent thing or something but it's like if you actually thought that he was at fault for it they've been so bad defensively that he would have to go like I so I feel like it's not I guess like I'm saying that because I don't know that it is him but it's like it's feels weird that they're so poor defensively yes you would think that yes the the manager might be able to turn the screws there tighten it up a bit and uh it's being sacrificed but yeah maybe the club just says our only ambition this season given the circumstances of 17th Place and right just given like how much it would cost us to sack O'Neal and we probably wouldn't get any like anybody remarkably better um give him give him like a this good fixture run like I expect if wolves are still uh like like firmly in the relegation Zone after this run through through like the end of the year then he'll be sacked for sure yeah I think so too um and I'm not advocating for sacking him I think um I think in general these squads probably move a little too quickly um to sack these guys but um yeah so anyway well I think we have an we have an interesting slate on uh Saturday and Sunday uh a very late match on Saturday I love when they do this they've been doing these a little more often Brandon and uh late game Liverpool uh hosting Aston Villa um I don't know what to think about Aston Ville anymore I mean it's it's a real like I hate I hate this cliche but it's like you know tale of two halves situation right like first half it's they look you know scoring a set piece look pretty strong defensively second half they caned four and I'm like I don't know quite what to make of them right now I think they've really been bit by the same bug is Newcastle when they got to the Champions League um that yeah yeah and also just like the learning curve to be fighting on on those fronts and the Onana coming into the Midfield in place of Douglas Louise I think is like it's a good signing but I just don't think it's clicked fully and I think that that really does weaken their um just like what they're trying to do transitionally yeah and he he went off as well didn't he or maybe maybe he just got hurt I can't remember if he actually went off in the match in the end hold on I'm pulling up the the match tracks because I don't I don't recall as as well I have uh Rogers off injured no uh Onana stayed on the pitch the entire time okay he did because I I remember at one point he got like walloped by somebody um but yeah and so I think that should be a fun match though regardless I'm looking forward to uh Liverpool Villa it's uh I mean I have um I mean I I don't know like I mean do you think that you'll Captain Salah this week again it's between Salah and alland um I mean there's there's really no great science to it uh Salah is my bus team captain but Brighton you know there are there are reasons why we used Salah to Target Brighton this week they have injuries and they do play very open so can Holland just like pull the finger out can actually start finishing some chances if so because you know I don't know the big brain way of thinking of Holland right now is uh wow maybe he's an edge to like be the last person who has Faith uh enough to Captain Holland yeah so I don't hate the brighten away fixture for Holland and uh as you're saying like I also do not hate borderline I like the home fixture against Villa fala yeah um yeah I I I think that makes sense I mean yeah and like how different is this uh conversation of Holland just converts that massive chance he has late in the uh bouth match yeah I'd probably like C defin I yeah I'd definitely be uh bus team Holland all the way in that situation for sure yeah yeah it just it feels like it's like reflective though of a little bit of it's like it's on the one hand sure it's unlucky and the other hand it's like reflective of him just not he's just not smashing the ball the way he kind of does when he's like in really good form right and fill confidence the chances just aren't that good and there's there's just too many crosses that he's being uh asked to convert cuz he's terrible in the air unless like he's unless he's doing like a scissor kick or something like there is just not enough space for Holland uh and I I think that this is why another reason to just get rid of foden ASAP uh because de bruyne is seems Seems crucial to help Holland find that space yeah there's something about I don't know if it's something to do with rerie not being there or something like that but it's like I feel like the Holland really thrives and I think kdb and rodri have both been good at sort of finding him in these spaces where like he's kind of like halfway in between um the center circle and the opposition goal right and it's like if you can get him in the ball with space like in that in that area he is so good I feel like driving forward and using his speed and I feel like but the way the matches have been going and I you know I'm maybe it's just because the ball is getting more clogged up Midfield and so the other team isn't Comm committing as many players forward and so they're able to kind of get back and stop these stop these chances I'm not really sure but well so you just have the ball all the time third doing nothing Yeah just they have the ball all the time and they're scoring like a goal a game it's like it's it's yeah it's so it's just not and so he just he's in the Box constantly right and just like it's like he he turns into like some Tony pus forward right just like waiting for you know something to that he can put his head on right and like that's sort of I don't yeah I agree that he's he's not thriving in this this current role so but with that said I think um I agree I think it's like it's pretty close between um Holland and and Salah uh other I mean I suppose um salanki as a captain see feels a little like a little too like what have you done for me lately uh son I actually wouldn't mind if you had sun in your squad I think Sun if a I just feel like I all these memories over the years of sun Captain Sun for these like easy fixtures and him like not because you know he is so good on the Counterattack right and he's so good at like converting these low XG chances and soon as I feel like when they're playing a team that they're just like clearly better than it's it doesn't actually suit his you just gave me a great idea like yeah all these uh optimal uh stats and predictive models for Fantasy I want a model That's Just sh cheely based on your memory um hey how about how about this for an idea by the way this is not related to what you just said but um why don't you why don't you use this other transfer uh to bring in Sun this week and then wild card in gameweek 12 why don't you have Sun for this for the if switch fixture and then kind of like kind of like plan to dead end your team and wild card into the next game week I game week 12 is already good time to wild card anyway so that's that's an interesting idea not convinced that sun is a worthwhile fantasy asset I guess I did just outline all the reasons uh not to necess but I'm just saying like it's it's an interesting strategy I think that there is some like it could work right because sure sure yeah um I mean and and gameweek 12 over the international break is a fantastic time to wild card because Arsenal do have that huge fixture turn and Cole Palmer becomes like even more like his his fixture are more enhanced as well so lots of different teams that you want to jump on so um I don't hate treating game we 11 as kind of like a wild punt sort of a game w i get it yeah I mean especially because I don't I don't think that Palmer is like super essential for game 11 anyway right because uh even with Arsenal flailing a little bit I I don't see Chelsea scoring like three goals in this match right I think it's going to be he they may score one and he scores that goal but I just don't see it as like a like a wideopen kind of game maybe I'm wrong about that but yeah I I don't know what to make of it uh either I mean I think it's GNA resemble a lot of what we saw in the Chelsea Manchester United match today uh I think it might look pretty similar to that and then I thought Chelsea just like really didn't call upon their attacking prowess enough which it was kind of odd like they they just didn't show what they could do Nicholas Jackson was like incredibly Anonymous until I realized he got a yellow card and I'm just like how does this guy always somehow find a way to get a yellow card even when you don't even see him on the pitch it's very very funny to me um but uh yeah I don't know but but having foden going into gameweek 11 also feels like and these just like bitter tears of foden just being a complete dud the last couple of weeks does feel like um like he's a waste of a spot in a fantasy squad for one week and that does feel way too passive for me like yes as you say like foden could doesn't have to become Palmer he could become anyone playing these these fixtures he could become Brennan Johnson for for that matter um right let's see who are the who would be like the other Plum fixture like Southampton who do yeah I mean I I it would really probably be Lina what's that yeah L yeah bring in lamina Mario Mario Jr as he's now called on on the website yeah it's Mario Jr I guess I mean honestly like you could you could look at Bruno um as a again it just it just sort yeah I mean interesting yeah I mean Brun like I I actually think there's like a quite good chance he gets some kind of attacking return in that Lester match so um yeah I guess again it's it's a luxury for you a little bit just because you have this wild card that you could maybe you know Punt and and maybe try to get one up on other managers right like that's sort of the advantage of having that wild card still as you can you can always and also they play if switch in 12 so it doesn't you wouldn't you wouldn't be dead ending with him so um I don't know it's an interesting thought well then yeah that's another reason for me to just like punt on the Wild Card bring in Bruno and I don't play the Wild Card yeah as as we all know Bruno Fernandez solves all fantasy problems always has uh always will all right we got a couple questions here Brandon sure let's get into them I think I have I have two questions that I've selected uh one is from FPL Brooklyn uh Arsenal have just not been clicking offensively or defensively should we stick for their gameweek 12 fixture swing so this is the this is a key question I think at this point it's really interesting I thought their lineup against Newcastle was pretty solid bar you know uh acknowledging that odard is out right you know they're defense was you know there were lots of injury concerns and I thought they had a pretty strong defense that that they lined up with so it's like it's not a Personnel issue there just seems to be a real mental block and that's the thing I guess that's the root of the question is do do good fixtures help even the most depressed team and Arsenal seem kind of depressed I think the answer is yes actually like for the record I I I do think that like I mean defensiv ly that that's the thing that's like giv me a little bit of pause I mean they like they're certainly like their their numbers are still fine defensively but it does feel like um I don't it's just a weird time with them because you don't really have that like one and I guess that's what I mean like if you're if you're like okay like I guess just to sort of look at the whole team Saka yes like I think that Saka is fine kind of regardless of fixture we saw that last week too right game week game week uh nine and uh yeah like he had one blank and Newcastle away it's always a tricky fixture especially whatever reason for Arsenal right there's just like these certain I I don't know why there's certain squads that just seem to struggle with certain teams right it's like it feels like uh um for a long time it was like man city and Crystal Palace had this like weird you know uh but when Arsenal go to Newcastle is just always a tough match and so it seems like Newcastle are kind of like especially up for it or something uh and so I think long term he's still a buy I mean I think you could buy him as as soon as as soon as this Chelsea match and and it'd be fine um defensively though I think it is a little bit trickier because you you know it's just it's Gabrielle right and and that's kind of it I mean um like at this point I wouldn't rebi celba um I don't think that that's um I mean I will I guess long term like I think he's fine but like I would I would go Gabriel first if I was going that way but again it's just like they don't feel super solid at the moment and you know they're conceeding a lot of goals and so basically you're like bringing him in in the hopes that you get like they get a bunch of set pieces right and he can like get his head on one which is which is like a an argument for him like for sure like I'm not diminishing that but um I don't know it's like outside of Saka there's no one I'd be really excited to bring in right now yeah they're they're really the Man City defense right now is they will they will make one or two huge mistakes this Arsenal defense a match at this point yeah um and uh I there's there's something going on there and I mean HS H Saka uh I think are they they will get their points a huge concern with the Arsenal attack is just like how bad trer and Martinelli have have been just last couple weeks like trossard in particular this weekend was was quite poor but um there's just no magic anywhere else in the team right now in the Midfield like r Rice and um God can kind of Moreno uh remember that gu name uh there's just not a huge amount of dynamism in that partnership yet uh I think there will be this is like this Arsenal team is built for next season as far as I'm concerned yeah well it's just like I there was like at some moment when like it was like Dean rice like does his best to try to create a goal by himself and I'm like is this like a problem is this like an actual problem that needs to get solved at this point which is that Delan rice like doesn't want to be a defensive midfielder anymore and it's like is this like is there a connection I mean it's obviously a great player but it's like setp delivery was was complete was horrible uh against Newcastle I'm just like are could they be creating better chances if he wasn't kind of like soloing it where he's like I'm gonna run in I'm gonna be like vintage Yaya Tor and I'm just he's not doing that that's just commentators uh loving like the you know the the handsome pristine looking Englishman Irishman maybe so I feel like uh I feel like I'm like I'm seeing a little too much of it myself but I I don't know I just I I just I something's going on with the defense and and I'm not quite uh or maybe it's just I don't know it's only 10 weeks right I mean it's it's still a you know cliche alert here Brandon but it's still a small sample right like I think um uh I think by the second half of the Season Man City and Arsenal will have figured it out and we'll be seeing a bunch of one nil and two-nil matches right I think that's that's that's what's coming so um for better or worse uh I guess kind of For Worse that what's what's fun about that you know long as Liverpool continue winning then you've got there's there's the drama yeah absolutely oh I mean they'll be drama like in terms of the table but I just mean like I do feel like we've seen the last couple years a bunch of these matches where it's like they have you have two highly motivated teams playing a bunch of teams that like are kind of locked into their spot right and so it's just like one nil two n one n two n i gota um all right last questions from Neymar butland Brandon he says this is more of an existential question at what point do you stop and ask yourself the question what is my team I feel as though I've been following so many pieces of advice and adding so many random players who I'm not sure about or not watch play with my own eyes yes I want to make fantasy fun again yes but I also want to make my own team my team again 100% how do I do that I mean the the answer is quite evident I think is you have to stop stop all non always cheating content you know seeking advice taking advice uh looking at other people's team I mean the whole the whole when fantasy content and discussion is at its best uh and it's something you know we strive for we don't always achieve is you know what let's talk about fantasy in terms of uh how much did did you have a good week A bad week uh did you watch any matches was it cool I don't want your excels okay I don't I don't this this isn't not like a this is not meant to spirited rant baseball was better before uh yeah Moneyball like anyway um this I know what you mean though this question resonates with me because um I I find myself in this position all the time I mean I guess like foden just to he he is like my example for everything on this episode that was a decision that I made without necessarily look looking at for advice or uh Consulting any tables or anything like that like I did it it was all me and still when I look at my team right now there's something about the aura that it puts out that doesn't feel like something that I necessarily wanted or missing a six million goalkeeper is yeah right yeah I mean come on you got to if that's your calling card you got to honor it it's like the the the who are the the water Bandits or who are the guys in Home Alone yeah yeah yeah the wet Bandits the wet Bandits you know they they had the argument like we can't you know turn the water on because that's how they'll catch us and he's like no but we got to have a a calling card so even if it's like is to your detri to be fair Joe pesi who didn't want to do that was was validated in the end right cuz they said oh we found all these uh we we have all these other crimes where they did the thing so now we can retroactively you know it's fine that that character did get his come up in in the hit movie cin which we talked about last week I think CRA what they did to the wet bandits in that cornfield that's true yeah Daniel Stern uh he's in the you can't see him actually but he goes into that he goes into that shallow grave first I think yeah that would be incredible if it was part of Cino was part of the Home Alone Universe came out on on the same time it's very possible um but yeah like I think it's I I I think you've got to uh make sure that there is your DNA in in your team otherwise you're 100% G to be uh not going to have fun unless you're like winning the uh FPL and that's that's hard that's how tight rope yeah I think you just I mean this was me a year or two ago and um the the answer is you just have to drastically reduce your amount of consumption uh I think of of fantasy content I mean again I hope you continue to listen to this podcast if you're an hour in then you then then I think you're a you know you're a a fan or a supporter or whatever but like there's a lot of um like I just basically don't spend time on Twitter anymore that was kind of the way that I saw this right like I just I was just on there too much I was watching too many teams and I it just gets in your head and then it's it's honestly like there's a bit of like fear of missing out right you're just like ah man like everybody's going for this player if he you know if he delivers and uh and I'm on here all day on Saturday or whatever I'm just going to be kicking myself and feeling like a the biggest idiot for not doing that but if you're not on these spaces all day then then that stuff can't hurt you right and um and so I think that's uh I mean yeah you can go the other way and be like oh yeah like when they when they don't do well I get to have shoden for it or whatever but like that's not like the greatest emotion either right like it's it's kind of it's not like the healthiest way to be like Oh I'm just like playing to root against people or whatever right so you know it's like better to just like again this is like a the big themee for this year but it's like focus on your mini leagues like you know like focus on that worry about that world and and then it's like yeah what are the what are the people in your mini leagues what do their squads look like right like maybe you've got to be the one who sends the email every week you know or gets the um the mini league mate dossier and distributes it right like the way you do Brandon twice you do it for two different leagues um yeah I love I love my mini league mates yeah exactly and it's like you know so like invest in that stuff and and then I think it doesn't matter so much um like you you won't worry so much about whether you have like the right players or the right template or whatever practically speaking though how do you make sure you have good uh players you like who are still good fantasy assets so it's all well and good to say well just fill your team with guys you like um you know and that's how you end up with like Adam Wharton in in your team or something I mean I think like you've got to use uh you know like well you have to like I mean you have to be like a little bit of strategically smart about some of this stuff right and you got to have some common sense and I think um I I will say though that even though I've reduced my consumption I'm still uh I you I have two different um uh like FPL review which we talked about in this podcast before and and ml tum these like Services where they just like produce numbers right and and and believe me like I am not just like picking the stuff that's that's that's generated from there nor are you right I mean we we certainly talk about them and they're interesting but that at least always gives me a I mean but like listen like they've had Bruno has been at the top of these charts for like 10 weeks right so like clearly like it is not for like months for so long as well right just has been doing nothing um I guess he got an assist last week um and so uh but there that at least I think gives you like a little Baseline right like the Mel talk thing I think it's like 199 right it's like nothing and then you like and then you can at least like pull up a little data chart be like okay because it's like a you know like okay I see like uh maybe I should look at these five players just because they're all at the top of the chart and they weren't necessarily on my radar and then you look and you're like ah right it's like it's like man united right where you're like oh I didn't realize they played Lester if switch and Everton the next three right and so maybe I should be um considering them more seriously stuff like that for sure all right yeah you you can do this yeah I think by by Christmas your your team will have a little bit more more flavor uh I'm sure of it Neymar Neymar butland also change your change your fantasy team name to Neymar butland FC I think that sound sounds a bit like Leroy Jenkins doesn't it Leroy chickens uh SI all right Brandon let's wrap things up here thank you so much for listening uh I I am feeling by the way that fall forward all of a sudden it's hit me like a like a like a brick yeah just one brick not a ton of bricks but one one big Bri like a huge brick uh and uh can't be a loadbearing maybe it is the maybe it's the one loadbearing brick Brandon in the pile the whole house of cards is about to collapse if we don't sign off

[Music],14776,hey cheaters welcome to the always cheating podcast my name is josh im here with brandon how are you im all right josh slow im a little worried because its its we have we fell back brandon we in america this last night was our fallback so for us we are recording this after nine its 800 on the on the on the official clock brandon but my body clock is telling me that its 908 pm right now so we see how we how what our stamina is like as the evening goes on here i dont know if im feeling tired because we we think its later than it is or if im feeling tired just watching my rank remain exactly the same every week i ive caught up with you but well you okay like lets just get right into it then shall we because i think i i think you want we fell back into our classic patterns this week for good or for ill i have been i have been aggressive this season and it has backfired sometimes and it has worked out sometimes right and its like they theyve neutralized like depending on like where this weekends up im im probably going to be at my highest rank since game week three and that was right when i decided to take it and make an ultra aggressive wild card brandon wild card had a lot of high performers for a lot of low performers right it seemed like a good idea at the time and so ive like im like jerry seinfeld br i ive come out in the middle somehow here so you are now like its been seven weeks since then where how are you feeling you feel like youre stuck in place after 11 its not over yet theres still one i do feel stuck i can certainly easily pinpoint what the problem has been it was ive lost two weeks to phil foden and remember we did a patreon pod before like the gw nine deadline and i was contemplating chris wood and guardal in or i ended up going with moleno and phil foden which you did on the pod in time like i maybe thats a dangerous game right there is the real time transfer i dont know if you maybe you maybe you were concerned about radiance brandon and it was it was a it was like a season ending cliffhanger i will sacrifice my overall rank to get those numbers up for sure no i dont think it was a bad idea at the time foden was certainly coming back into the city squad city it cuts both ways like v space became more secure because of injuries and form became has become quite poor because in man city were about to play southampton at home right going into game week nine like its not i dont think you have to retroactively bang your head against the wall too much he also had a very good match in game week nine but better i think in nine than in 10 i havent looked at his like the underlying performance from foden it was one of i was i was watching multiple matches on sunday i saw him miss a pretty good chance i feel like it was in the first half but i assume you more closely than me so what did you think about foden well he was fine yes he didnt have as many clearcut opportunities for fantasy points than he did against southampton and city just they looked worse this week certainly they could not create any big chances and what chances they made holland chief among them it just couldnt finish them at all and holland was quite poor now i dont want to get to like morose about that transfer two weeks ago because there is always a ripple effect over the course of a month plus and so what i what where im at right now with the foden move is if i had done the gardiol wood move a couple weeks ago i would be in incredible shape right now because gardels hit in those two weeks as his wood however i wouldnt be in a position to for free this week get triple premium so now im just totally enamored of the triple premium and i would have if i have already done hs to wood and now i can for free on exact money do fod in to palmer and so now i can like im in that im heading into that gw w transfer window of just like looking at a in awe at my team which is honestly never where you want to be because thats usually when things go but i the just to finish that point i wouldnt be able to get palmer right now if i had done those other moves so its an interesting fantasy conundrum of would you trade those points for the last two weeks to get your optimal team at the moment well and were about to be i im glad you brought up the the premium situation because i think that was if there was like a big talking point in fantasy this week and one that i think i came to late i was a little reluctant to embrace it and it was it was do we just give up on holland at the moment like is there enough chaos at man city with all of the injuries we joked on the patreon pol last week about peps grumpy press conference right where he was like i dont know everyones on the everyones getting a massage right now theyre all on the train whatever ive got nine players or whatever this like once a year pep has like a press conference like this right where hes like we have no money we have no its a like he cant help it right but i its fine we all you wonder though it is positive thats peps hes communicating to his team in that moment of like im i see whats going on here and im even going to communicate through the press to you that like get it together you its not that bad so but to me its like it feels like more deus than that right its like i dont know like well see if we can scratch out a point this weekend with our with our mash unit so and they and they didnt they got seano which was pretty awesome i have been in the antoine seano fan club for well i dont know for a year right like it has beened for multiple seasons but going back to last season i thought he was he was fantastic he lost a little bit of i feel like he didnt have the spotlight last year because he was in a complimentary role to dominic salanki who also had a great season for bournemouth but sano was this right wing who was just making all sorts of things happen down the stretch for bournemouth last season and even with sank gan and evan nson coming in hes still doing that and i its interesting because its i dont know its like i dont know if im going to he may not even stay in my team because there are so many cheap midfielders and i have to decide between him and morgan rogers i think if im going to go with the with the thrum the three mum approach which im leaning towards as well by the way u at the moment i dont know i theres a couple of injuries too weve got like palmers flagged now and morgan rogers is flagged and we need to see where these guys are over the next couple days they both should be fine i me morgan rogers it was like it was like i couldnt tell if he just got kicked one too many times right because he went down once right like right around the 60th minute i remember because i was like watching the cl i was i did you start rogers this week as well i did so i was like watching the clock im like wait is he going off here too cuz it was like 5940 when he was on the ground and then he went down a second time and thats when they took him off about 10 minutes later so i think hes probably fine its like the classic knock right contact injury and i didnt even see what happened with palmer nor i played the full 90 played the full 90 but now hes hes got a flag on the site too so well see what the deal is there it could be one of these like chris wood style injuries right where chris wood it was like it seemed like he was going to be fine and he was right like in general theres like theres there are two kinds of 75 flags right theres the like seems like theyre fine should be fine and the 75 flag thats more like zero out for six months man like exactly like e like e was 75 exactly like they were 75 until the manager definitively came out and said that they were i dont know you like never see a 50 flag anymore i feel like like its its like 50 and 25 like those its our its our polarized climate now josh its its everythings very black and white either youre on one side or the other either youre injured or youre not interesting you think theres flag hurting going on like this pole hurting i keep i keep about they want everything to be 75 maybe so but anyway just to get back to the premium thing for a second because i think it was interesting and the question was i think for a lot of us we were debating between salah and holland you had salah already so it was a little easier for you to just stick with holland i would have done the same thing if i had if i had holland but not having salah and wanting to longterm make this move to have three premiums and if you want to get into that we talked about it for like a half hour on last weeks pod right so we dont think we need to rehash it go through all of it again but i think the idea is that it does seem like virtually every week theres going to be three out of four of these guys are going to deliver mhm interestingly this was the week where it was just one right it was just salah and if you had salah and you captained him he just got nine points which isnt that much but nine points with a holland blank feels huge right and so i think that was i dont think many people have no sol or holland its possible but i think most people have one of the two and so you saw i think a big contrast in returns and if you just had solent captain him that was probably enough for you to be in a gray or green arrow you and i both have i believe three players in the monday match right right i have smith row you have rul and then we both have momo and robinson so were were rooting for mass chaos in the monday night fixture i forget who did you bench to to bring you started give or you started your full did you who did you bench that you could start your fulham midfielder i ended up benching liam deap so that i could start emil smith row so when we talked on thursday night with our patreon supporters my thought was well this lester fixture is choice thats like thats grade a beef for leam deap and the more i just thought about it the more like my real just like confidence in ip switch is like fully waning and i just decided to trust that and then also go for the fun of having as many players as possible in the final fixture of the game we and also like roll with my fen boys so im thrilled that i made that choice and then i had kaa the other choice i had to make this weekend was kaa or pedro poro am i defense and i opted to bench kaa and then villa are first to score and i think yet again ive blown it i won in the end josh one point from poro instead of zero from kaa so take that as a win i know thats always the l like when you when the cona thing was like when that late goal and youre like well who does that help salanki owners but then it was like well it hurts the cona starters they lose they lose a extra point from that so i think it was interesting weekend so what i ultimately ended up doing and ill ill share my team here just that we can we can talk through it a little bit is i did end up making the move its funny i went on i went and like apologized on on our discord because i was like listen i didnt talk about this move at all on last nights pod where we talked about our moves for a half hour because i just was extremely reluctant to part ways with holland and i ultimately decided it was worthwhile to do it just because i it was the only way i could get to saka as well right and so im thinking it was like a move that was made with gw 12 in mind right which is when the fixtur finally get a little bit better for for arsenal and i think for you its its a little different because you still have a wild card to play right and so for you dont have to be thinking longterm quite its so funny im like setting myself up for all of these like perfect moves meanwhile i have a wild card where i could just do it whenever i wanted what is are you thinking you might just you might just not use it like you might just hold off and listen i just like sometimes i like to flex and hey listen i put it in the comments if you want to see brandon not play his wild card i want to hear from you so i am im on 48 on the week so far and its its i so i brought in garal and that has worked out extremely well because i was debating between garal and lewis and you could certainly make it a the case for lewis is that hes 13m cheaper and felt like he was fairly locked into the squad but h not so fast right kyle walker comes back in gets the captains armband the real life one not the fantasy one and then to make things even worse rico lewis comes on as a late sub right so youre getting the like the nightmare scenario for if youre a lewis owner whereas gardial gets clean sheet and three bonus last week and then scores a goal he like didnt even celebrate the goal like that was it was the classic like i dont even know like this is good because they were down twonil and he wanted to you get rest rolling its a hes a soldier of fortune gual hes just out there to do a job and make sure points like a hess troop in the revolutionary war branded i like it so hes a i like that lets start calling gardial the hes on this po moving for so gavard and so but i did i dropped holland for raul i considered salanki that was the algo recommended move in brandon score one for the alos because in the first in the first half of that spurs match i was like see no salani this is like this is this is smart this is wise like us man exactly humans went im watching these games okay i know not to get salani like smash cut to the end of the match where hes got two goals and an assist u and looked great too like a totally completely different player and he ends up 16 points so r no pressure tomorrow just outscore dominic sanki 16 points and will be good but so rogers came through that with nine jamie vy who lowkey has been fine like totally fine as a as a as my cheap forward i got five points from him this week a nice assist too in the iu goal and jordan iio by the way just hanging around like hes hes gonna be like danny wellb back youre just 17 seasons in hes still gonna be getting minutes for these squads not necessarily a starter anymore but he can like he can come he can come in and do a job like this is his second sub appearance goal in two matches so so but i got a an assist from bardy got a goal and two bonus last week and a goal the week before that so you perfectly respectable returns for a sub6 million forward and watkins blanks and i think thats looking ahead to gw 11 i think thats where my brain is and i have to say brandon i did not think id be doing this on the pop but i also didnt think id be dropping holland last week so watkins to dominic salanki looms as a possible game week 11 transfer whats your watkins is about to price drop in the next hour while we pod do you have do you have room wiggle room there he rose in price after i bought him so hes at n i bought him at 9 hes at 91 now so it would just it wouldnt matter and so watkins to salanki spurs play i switch in gw 11 makes some logical sense id like to wait a couple of days to do it if i could because they do have a europa league match on thursday so ideally i would i would wait until after that well see how the price changes i would probably take one point1 change like another one on the chin i dont know if id take two right and so and so but i think that would feel like a fairly logical move i also have because i made this holland switch and br and salah it freed up like something like three million if i do watkins to salani that would give me enough mo enough money to move either sano or rogers to saka in gw 12 so it like the moves almost pick themselves i feel like right barring any serious injuries i think that feels like a pretty logical move for gw 11 is just boom watkins to salani right target tot home match great fixture and the fixtures coming up for spurs too are enticing some people will be thrown off by the man city away fixture in gw 12 theyve got two home pictures with ip switch and fulam on either side followed by bourne myth like a salanki return home thats just got narrative written all over it thats true its like it could go could go either way right its like a non celebration i feel like no matter what right and then the two f the two tough matches following that chelsea and then liverpool with southampton those two tough matches are both at home for spurs so i feel like theyre going to take a ton of confidence from this villa result this weekend after like going through a rough patch feels like a good time to have spurs assets and what do you i know neither of us have been and i should say we have not been super high on spurs salanki i think you and i were both big fans of bournemouth salan right and so it just hasnt quite he hadnt quite clicked for spurs had some injuries also hadnt shown a particularly high ceiling right for spurs so far and does one half wipe all that away like what do you think about now todays match i dont how could it cant possibly like what weve seen of solank at spurs beyond that one half has been mr back to goal scarce scant chances but it could just be as simple as playing more expansive ambitious team like aston villa to open up the play a little bit more there was a little bit more space on the wings and that just favored salanki so it just he could just be a fixture player perhaps but just looking at the way managers are jumping having held kept the faith with salanki hes absolutely an asset to continue keeping the faith with just given like if its working for spurs its going to work a lot and his ceiling is like so i think what we discovered this weekend is sanis ceiling is a lot higher than we would have thought and its its still unclear what floor is and i think its its his price is low enough that you dont have to move everything right you dont have to completely shift your team around to bring him in and so i do think hes i hate to be like the prisoner of the moment like this but i dont know when a when a forward scores a brace and has one of the worst defenses at home in the next match its those moves are pretty simple sometimes right like you dont have to overthink it too much and then the question is just do you wait until friday to make the move or you just go ahead and pull the trigger early so did you say you already made your moves for game week 11 or well i did not make a transfer heading into this weekend so i have two free and ive already moved hts to wood because i have exact money to do this move to do hts to wood and fod in to cole palmer okay so ive done one half of it to catch the chriswood price rise and now i have 01 to give on foden but i cant okay manage the price for as im palmer so im just watching that and i will theres theres no real sense of me waiting too long if theres news about palmers fitness and of course bb in the youtube chat made a good point it was that martinez challenge at the end of the man utd match where he caught palmer on the knee and hes fine then i me he like played the rest he like had a chance shortly after that so i think its fine right so theres no reason for me to hold off because co p wont be playing midweek cuz hes not on the chelsea team sheet for europa just yet so anyway those what is phil foden gonna do in the champions league to make me be like wow ive got a hold of him seeing de bruyne on the bench for man city with like fodens got to go like immediately now i dont even know if hes even going to play nor is there any reason to keep him and an arsenal fixture for chelsea its tough arsenal have a good defense but what a great time to play arsenal like arsenal were like in like severe i dont want to be around anymore mode this weekend and i think cole palmer just he clearly doesnt care who hes playing i think hes playing well he had a a downbeat match against man utd but it ended up being a tricky match i think just because of the the manager change right i think i the united players were up for it for sure they were up for it exactly and i think that changed things a little bit he had he could have had an assist right so it just it wasnt quite his day but i think that match for me i traditionally think of that especially i dont know seems like especially when man united host chelsea that match always i know its like the most they were saying today that in the todays broadcast that its the most drawn match in the premier league and that squares up with my own memory it does feel like every time man united host chelsea it is like a 11 or nilnil draw and im im not quite sure why that is but lets lets lets lets go back just for a moment to the beginning of game week 10 because arsenal did stumble again they played away to newcastle probably played their strongest match of the season so far and another tough match for all arsenal assets right you hts with a onepointer saka blanked defense concedes a goal i think it was like the 12th or 15th minute i cant when eso scored fairly early in the game and and then that was it right it was i dont know like i just like its a tri i still feel like its going to turn around like i and i i at this point im almost thinking more like in terms of fantasy results than i am like the actual team like i we got our old arsenal back josh where theyre playing for fourth place again and we love it such a no i dont love it i hate it however who would have thought like the story this season was going to be like i to me it was like arsenal are finally there like theyre finally g to push through and then it like liverpool are like the not so fast like maybe well just steal this title and with man city losing today it like its its very open still clearly right like its its its i in my head i thought man city had already lost i was surprised when i read that it was their first loss of the season like they just had a couple of theyve had these like the draw with arsenal the late win over world have we been so have we been so warped by like the last fiveish years where you can only win the title if youre undefeated like there were barclays the barclays era of the premier league has been in the air this season and lets go back where you can lose like five matches and still win the title thats exciting thats cool i think its cool too like i hope we have a threeway or more race i think that would be awesome the other cool story was there were a couple questions too about forest but forest in third place which i think is so cool like its i think its its just fun like even fantasy aside its its just always like every year theres one team like last year it was villa right and i dont know that i gen genely think that forest could get a champions league spot but i think that theyre they could they sneak into like a europa league spot maybe they have a they have a strong defense they have some callum hudson they have players like callum hudson andoy who like are like highly pedigreed players right who battled injury and for there was a time a few years ago i dont remember this when chelsea were fending off bayern munich who were making a big push for callum hutson m so then he had this like it was like he was trying to get into that break into that squad and like i was like like lets make him left wing back hudson ao right it was like they were like trying everything to make it work and i just wonder if that screwed with him a little bit its like a its like a like a baseball hitter who theyre like like you should change your swing right so that you can hit more home runs like change your launch angle right and then suddenly its like they cant they cant do anything anymore and i just wonder and last year he battled injuries on and off too what what also screws with your confidence when your club buys 20 other left wingers right exactly my god and i thought enzo was bad today also enzo i dont know what its like the way he color like his haircut now he looks like cole palmer on the pitch its annoying to me like i was trying to like maybe my tv just isnt big enough fernandez looks like no i dont in general no cole palmer is possibly the most distinctive looking person in the premier league but for some reason when they were today there were like three or four times when i thought that i thought it was cole palmer and then i was like thats enzo with the ball so i think he i think hes you got like a different haircut so are you thinking of the right like enzo fernandez came on like as a substitute very la late in the match who knows does he have blonde hair now am i am i am i like totally wrong about this im going to do a google image search for the last 24 hours prob i genuinely can are you confusing him with rasmuss holand perhaps no im not i dont know well solve this mystery maybe who maybe i thinking of somebody else i dont know like well im going to do some di baff well find well figure this out so but on forest you so you brought in chris wood ana who youve been like he i know i jokingly often say this but like he is your boy this season like youve been youve been big uping him all year and so he he gets the goal i think he ended up with three bonus points as well in the match so their defense looks strong midfield i dont know morgan gibs whites in battling some injuries and so its hard to recommend him but hudson adoy has sneakily been pretty good this season and let me see just let me pull him up real quick here as were as were talking hes now the top midfielder for forest hes got its just its just two goals and one assist so its not like mindblowing but i dont know i just feel like the way theyre clicking right now there might be some interesting options there maybe its it honestly might just be wood and anar the only two you want to consider although sells as a as the as a cheap keeper like if i could go back and do my wild card again and in fact when you wild card brandon i think ss would have to be someone youd consider right hes 46m ill take anyone like its the first goalkeeper to get in line like you play that game when youre a kid like last one to get your knee like that it right first goalkeeper the touch and knee is my goalkeeper hes got hes racked up an assist so far this season hes got four clean sheets lets see hes got six bonus points he honestly he probably been one of the one of the better cheap keepers that you could have this season so im up on forest im rooting for them i also like their red color brandon i maybe just like red squads but i think aesthetically theyre like a fun squad like theyre fun squad to watch in this year i think in general i like to watch most of the teams in the premier league this year like outside of southampton i feel like the thing about lester like in its like youre talking about like benching dap for that match and i do get it because theyre not exactly pushovers like they dont they concede goals but like every match they play is like so unpredictable its like you dont know its a little bit like what you that feel you get when youre in a fpl headtohead league and you have to play average that week i feel like when you play lester this season its like going against the fpl average youre like i should win this like but i dont know but i dont know and im going to lose more than i expect yep so so i think i dont know i think that like theyre theyre theyre an interesting team im just going to hold vardy by the way for a while like i dont i dont see any reason to like if could make an easy move to wood at some point ill do it but otherwise like how much does cost these days hes like 56 something like that nothing right so im not i wouldnt even necessarily recommend buying him like they play away to man united in game 11 but all right so like im just moving through my little my talking points for todays match brandon what did you think about gardial by the way hes 62m so hes very pricey in general we have not been getting a lot from keepers this season but bonus in the last match goal theres something about the left back spot for man city it does seem to be a spot where i think maybe especially with kyle walker when he plays right because hes so strong defensively that maybe that is a spot where you could get a little bit more like he to me hes probably the second and maybe honest the only the one other player you can have on man city right now outside of outside of holland right its its a mess otherwise it is hes a strange fantasy ass at guardio because you are relying on him getting attacking returns because i thought he had a poor defensive match and just city nothing needs to be said beyond theyve been horrible defensively all season but he but he has this pension for popping up and getting attacking returns and its like how much are you willing to spend cu he doesnt get attacking returns the way a lot of fullbacks do like the trent alexanders arnold of the world like hes never hes i dont think ive ever seen vardal cross the ball but hes certainly looking to get on the end of a onew or on the end of a cross so i like him for that right hes more of a goalscoring fullback than a like hes not hes not andy robertson right hes got like a very different hes a sheamus coleman we could say hes hes mores hes more a sheamus coleman than a leighton baines okay well if he was on pens maybe he could be a he could be a b why not why not why not so lets see hes got on the season safari hes got three goals in no assists those three goals have come in the last five matches so hes hes like i dont know i dont know like i statistically i dont know how to like talk about streakiness or whatever but he has been a very streaky asset in fantasy we saw this last season as well right where he put in a lot of good performan like he pass the eye test right like you when you watched him in these man city matches it was like wow this guy is like all over the ball hes getting hugely advanced positions like and but it but he also had this run of 10 plus matches like that like last season where he just got no attacking returns right just nothing and he was expensive and this season the same way the first five weeks of the season no goals and no assists and now hes got three goals in his last five with a u a clean sheet and three bonus thrown in as well right and the three bonus comes at least a little bit from the threat that he was providing right on the the like you said i dont i r like much like trent im rarely impressed with his defensive capab it was weird in the liverpool match there was some moment where trent like gave the ball away in a bad spot and the announcers were like unusual for tren i was like i dont think so thats what you pay for so i think with guial hes the fantasy asset that you stumble backwards into like in just in the right game we it feels right and you go for it i cant see any like grander plan involving guardal like why you would like he would be a part of a team you were you were constructing over the course of a month that a thing because i think where were at right now is like trying to get as much extract as much money out of our defense as possible because theres no real value there now you have and trent at this point whats the deal there its not going to last and but i think at the moment it is tricky because one of the other talking points this week was that we had these great performances from the popular cheap midfielders right rogers with a goal and two bonus sano a goal and three bonus even brennan johnson came through with a goal and its it feels like a little polarized in terms of like youre getting returns from the five million guys and the 12m guys and its like you dont want to have like a 9m midfielder right like or even like a nine million forward like i ive had watkins the last few weeks and hes been hugely disappointing right and it feels like hes foden hes my foden exactly hes my hes my rushmore brandon and so thats thats what thats whats happening with me right now i thought brennan johnson hes like talk about a player who passed the eye test he he does look good in these matches and probably overdue to get a goal and he plays he plays leaf davis next week who loves getting roasted on brennan johnsons side talk about lea davis the poor mans gardial right with the hes normally more of an assist guy than a goal scorer but like hes hes no ones hes no ones idea of a great defensive player but he just gets it was awesome i know i felt a little bad for them conceding because are they still without a win on the season too i believe so yes and southampton did pick up their first win too a a close one with that i that offside decision was tight i dont know if you saw the meleno just getting robbed of fpl points people always complain about so theres all this like esoteric fantasy crap like bonus point systems and and like where am i holding midfielder points what i hate i hate the fact that you get clean sheet points only to have them taken away and that just doesnt it makes everyone feel bad okay thats true they shouldnt award the clean sheet points till the game is over thats a good thats thats true because i hate i hate logging into my team when theres a clean sheet in there right i dont even like to cing yourself i thought you meant he had supplied the assist for the the bet no i just wanted some clean i just wanted some points was that so much to ask it was it was so much to it was too much to ask all right well lets okay one final thing here brandon which is man united assets we get the the bruno pen we also got a holand assist right he earned the pen some clowny goalkeeping from sanchez as i thought on that on that particular play you just cannot touch the player right like thats of course hes going to dive like every you and i would dive if like a goalkeeper touches your feet you have to fall over if youre in the box thats just what you do right and so but like defensively they were i thought they were okay like they like you said they were they were up for this match and it took a a screamer right a great goal from outside the box for them to even concede anything in this match so did you come away like slightly more interested in any man united assets or did you think it was all just a well the their defense was more impressive mazari was the player who i liked the most in the match and my main issue with man utd was i thought their attack was pretty blunt and not great like garnacho was i think easily the worst player on the pitch which like i its one match and you would want to be very optimistic as a man utd supporter that things are going in the right direction and garnacho is allowed to have a bad match would i would i bank on garnacho over marcus rashford at this point probably but still it was like holand rashford garnacho i was like well this is like i dont know how far you can go with these three guys up front it feels like bruno and mai were the guys who impressed me the most could you could you is onana going to beat cells to the punch in my goalkeeping wild card position its their next their next i wonder if you end up talking yourself into an early wild card here brandon honestly because the trio of matches coming up for man united are probably as good as it gets right they have lester at home in gw 11 ip switch away in gw 12 and everton at home in game league 13 so its its a trio of strong matches i think i dont know its like maybe its not your particular squad brandon but like just because im talking to you like but i think like someone out there if they want to be a little bit different this probably for the first time this season br ill say this but this might be the time to get bruno and just and just take a punt and see if he can deliver for you because the like the chance of a like extreme return from him is never going to be higher than it is in the next three weeks right like a high ceiling return like either lester at home it such a way again like theyre unpredictable like lester especially but but unpredictability can be good in fantasy 2 right like you could see a bunch of goals from both squads in this match so i dont know its like i do think that gar i dont know like garnacho maybe holand im still i feel like the still out i dont quite believe it yet but i dont know and then you have xery come on and im like im always like i forget hes there right im like like xery which is a i always want to say i always want to say xerxes by the way too like the old the old emperor ruler its like a anent babylon or whatever right well i dont think you have to spend too much time thinking about xery youll be fine fair enough all right well lets move on here brandon why dont you give a quick patreon promotion you promote our patreon i id love to and we dont want to sell it too hard every week

and take a look at gw 11 all right so game week 11 and i will share of course well talk through it but ill share it just so you and i can be on the same page we can so we can read from the same prayer book as you like to say yes love to say that and so this is the final game week before the next international break i know you are hoping it would come sooner brandon but dont worry youve got you got one coming were almost there its they jam them in and im im also sad to tell you this is the last international break i believe until march so its a nice i know exactly everybody so are your what is international champions cup head whatever they call this the nations league the nations league i cant keep up with any of these things anymore brandon they get rebranded all the time and its you can tell how i feel about them just from that expression there so i they do get i will say the international breaks get better when you have stuff like world cup qualifying thrown into the mix right i think that does raise the stakes a little bit but when its just like friendlies its hard for me to stay who cares who bloody cares exactly so all right so anyway game week 11 so we have matches just on saturday and sunday its your classic post champ chs league europa league split bunch of matches are on sunday so of course that is a reminder that on tuesday and wednesday we have champions league games all we games on thursday involving i think six premier league squads play at midweek so if you can hold off on your transfers unless youre tight on budget i would i would try to do so we saw just this last week with the with the league cup right which in theory should be less of a like lift but the league cup there were a bunch of people knocked out from that as a as a among them so i think that its its an interesting slate of fixtures though the one that as i talked about the beginning of the pod that stands out to me is that spurs ipss switch match and for me i just dont have anybody for that match right now and that feels like the one where i could its a little bit like the arsenal southampton match several weeks ago where i was like well maybe i can just maybe i can just skate by well i dont i have one defender of that ill just ill just skate by and itll be fine like how bad could it be not having saka or you anybody else in that game it was terrible it was like a it was a upended my season in some ways right i took a massive hit and so i that is the one where im like i feel like i want to get into that into that attack if i can and so i am looking at salanki for that one lets see southampton wolves saw south southampton the other squad where youre you want to target your fixtur if you can and i will say again st larson continues to put in some nice performances if they i i dont find wolves to be trustworthy at all i certainly wouldnt recommend bringing in any of their assets at the moment but theyre at least like back in the conversation of getting like theyre more fantasy relevant than west ham at this point brandon so thats thats something why west ham persisting with this la pegy its its funny like at least oneal at wolver hampton like theres some theres i dont know theres no point im talking about either these teams but like wolves is the bandwagon in fpl right now cia and larson are the main guys and as well so lots of fun cheap guys to choose from where west ham like the players you might want to pick up like bowen are just like too expensive for what youre getting for that team so i get it but i agree like wolves just dont like theyre just because the fixtures turned doesnt mean theyre suddenly a good outfit and i think they have so much still to prove and you dont have that one asset that like like quang chan last season like what they do is score goals i think may there may be they may be one of the teams thats like never theyve theyve scored in every match so far this season like lets lets see lets look at their matches scored scor sc scored they had scored in every match so like goals is what youre trying goals and assists is what youre trying to buy unfortunately they canc it roughly a 2 one ratio i was thinking and i know this isnt super fantasy relevant either but i just because its on my mind i was thinking watching that because that was the aral failed to score against them anyway sorry go ahead nine out of 10 then but it was the fe the featured match for some reason on saturday was this w wolves palace game and so i was watching it and i was thinking about whether because both the gos they were just like theyre so shaggy defensively and its like and i was wondering im like is that on oneal and if so if it if it is on him like you like you have to sack him right its like or its like or its like a talent thing but its like if you thought that he was at fault for it theyve been so bad defensively that he would have to go like i so i feel like its not like im saying that because i dont know that it is him but its like its feels weird that theyre so poor defensively yes you would think that yes the manager might be able to turn the screws there tighten it up a bit and its being sacrificed but maybe the club just says our only ambition this season given the circumstances of 17th place and right just given like how much it would cost us to sack oneal and we probably wouldnt get any like anybody remarkably better give him give him like a this good fixture run like i expect if wolves are still like firmly in the relegation zone after this run through like the end of the year then hell be sacked for sure i think so too and im not advocating for sacking him i think i think in general these squads probably move a little too quickly to sack these guys but so anyway well i think we have an we have an interesting slate on saturday and sunday a very late match on saturday i love when they do this theyve been doing these a little more often brandon and late game liverpool hosting aston villa i dont know what to think about aston ville anymore its its a real like i hate i hate this cliche but its like tale of two halves situation right like first half its they look scoring a set piece look pretty strong defensively second half they caned four and im like i dont know quite what to make of them right now i think theyve been bit by the same bug is newcastle when they got to the champions league that and also just like the learning curve to be fighting on those fronts and the onana coming into the midfield in place of douglas louise i think is like its a good signing but i just dont think its clicked fully and i think that does weaken their just like what theyre trying to do transitionally and he went off as well didnt he or maybe he just got hurt i cant remember if he went off in the match in the end hold on im pulling up the match tracks because i dont i dont recall as well i have rogers off injured no onana stayed on the pitch the entire time okay he did because i remember at one point he got like walloped by somebody but and so i think that should be a fun match though regardless im looking forward to liverpool villa its i have i dont know like do you think that youll captain salah this week again its between salah and alland theres theres no great science to it salah is my bus team captain but brighton there are there are reasons why we used salah to target brighton this week they have injuries and they do play very open so can holland just like pull the finger out can start finishing some chances if so because i dont know the big brain way of thinking of holland right now is wow maybe hes an edge to like be the last person who has faith enough to captain holland so i dont hate the brighten away fixture for holland and as youre saying like i also do not hate borderline i like the home fixture against villa fala i think that makes sense and like how different is this conversation of holland just converts that massive chance he has late in the bouth match id probably like c defin i id definitely be bus team holland all the way in that situation for sure it just it feels like its like reflective though of a little bit of its like its on the one hand sure its unlucky and the other hand its like reflective of him just not hes just not smashing the ball the way he does when hes like in good form right and fill confidence the chances just arent that good and theres theres just too many crosses that hes being asked to convert cuz hes terrible in the air unless like hes unless hes doing like a scissor kick like there is just not enough space for holland and i think that this is why another reason to just get rid of foden asap because de bruyne is seems crucial to help holland find that space theres something about i dont know if its something to do with rerie not being there like that but its like i feel like the holland thrives and i think kdb and rodri have both been good at finding him in these spaces where like hes like halfway in between the center circle and the opposition goal right and its like if you can get him in the ball with space like in that in that area he is so good i feel like driving forward and using his speed and i feel like but the way the matches have been going and i im maybe its just because the ball is getting more clogged up midfield and so the other team isnt comm committing as many players forward and so theyre able to get back and stop these stop these chances im not sure but well so you just have the ball all the time third doing nothing just they have the ball all the time and theyre scoring like a goal a game its like its its its so its just not and so he just hes in the box constantly right and just like its like he turns into like some tony pus forward right just like waiting for something to that he can put his head on right and like thats i dont i agree that hes hes not thriving in this current role so but with that said i think i agree i think its like its pretty close between holland and salah other salanki as a captain see feels a little like a little too like what have you done for me lately son i wouldnt mind if you had sun in your squad i think sun if a i just feel like i all these memories over the years of sun captain sun for these like easy fixtures and him like not because he is so good on the counterattack right and hes so good at like converting these low xg chances and soon as i feel like when theyre playing a team that theyre just like clearly better than its it doesnt suit his you just gave me a great idea like all these optimal stats and predictive models for fantasy i want a model thats just sh cheely based on your memory hey how about how about this for an idea by the way this is not related to what you just said but why dont you why dont you use this other transfer to bring in sun this week and then wild card in gw 12 why dont you have sun for this for the if switch fixture and then like like plan to dead end your team and wild card into the next game week i game week 12 is already good time to wild card anyway so thats thats an interesting idea not convinced that sun is a worthwhile fantasy asset i did just outline all the reasons not to necess but im just saying like its its an interesting strategy i think that there is some like it could work right because sure and gw 12 over the international break is a fantastic time to wild card because arsenal do have that huge fixture turn and cole palmer becomes like even more like his fixture are more enhanced as well so lots of different teams that you want to jump on so i dont hate treating game we 11 as like a wild punt a game w i get it especially because i dont i dont think that palmer is like super essential for game 11 anyway right because even with arsenal flailing a little bit i dont see chelsea scoring like three goals in this match right i think its going to be he they may score one and he scores that goal but i just dont see it as like a like a wideopen game maybe im wrong about that but i dont know what to make of it either i think its gna resemble a lot of what we saw in the chelsea man utd match today i think it might look pretty similar to that and then i thought chelsea just like didnt call upon their attacking prowess enough which it was odd like they just didnt show what they could do nicholas jackson was like incredibly anonymous until i realized he got a yellow card and im just like how does this guy always somehow find a way to get a yellow card even when you dont even see him on the pitch its very funny to me but i dont know but having foden going into gw 11 also feels like and these just like bitter tears of foden just being a complete dud the last couple of weeks does feel like like hes a waste of a spot in a fantasy squad for one week and that does feel way too passive for me like yes as you say like foden could doesnt have to become palmer he could become anyone playing these fixtures he could become brennan johnson for that matter right lets see who are the who would be like the other plum fixture like southampton who do i it would probably be lina whats that l bring in lamina mario jr as hes now called on the website its mario jr honestly like you could you could look at bruno as a again it just it just sort interesting brun like i think theres like a quite good chance he gets some attacking return in that lester match so again its its a luxury for you a little bit just because you have this wild card that you could maybe punt and maybe try to get one up on other managers right like thats the advantage of having that wild card still as you can you can always and also they play if switch in 12 so it doesnt you wouldnt you wouldnt be dead ending with him so i dont know its an interesting thought well then thats another reason for me to just like punt on the wild card bring in bruno and i dont play the wild card as we all know bruno fernandez solves all fantasy problems always has always will all right we got a couple questions here brandon sure lets get into them i think i have i have two questions that ive selected one is from fpl brooklyn arsenal have just not been clicking offensively or defensively should we stick for their gw 12 fixture swing so this is the this is a key question i think at this point its interesting i thought their lineup against newcastle was pretty solid bar acknowledging that odard is out right theyre defense was there were lots of injury concerns and i thought they had a pretty strong defense that they lined up with so its like its not a personnel issue there just seems to be a real mental block and thats the thing thats the root of the question is do good fixtures help even the most depressed team and arsenal seem depressed i think the answer is yes like for the record i do think that like defensiv ly thats the thing thats like giv me a little bit of pause they like theyre certainly like their numbers are still fine defensively but it does feel like i dont its just a weird time with them because you dont have that like one and thats what like if youre if youre like okay like just to look at the whole team saka yes like i think that saka is fine regardless of fixture we saw that last week too right game week game week nine and like he had one blank and newcastle away its always a tricky fixture especially whatever reason for arsenal right theres just like these certain i dont know why theres certain squads that just seem to struggle with certain teams right its like it feels like for a long time it was like man city and crystal palace had this like weird but when arsenal go to newcastle is just always a tough match and so it seems like newcastle are like especially up for it and so i think long term hes still a buy i think you could buy him as soon as soon as this chelsea match and itd be fine defensively though i think it is a little bit trickier because you its just its gabrielle right and thats it like at this point i wouldnt rebi celba i dont think thats i will long term like i think hes fine but like i would i would go gabriel first if i was going that way but again its just like they dont feel super solid at the moment and theyre conceeding a lot of goals and so youre like bringing him in the hopes that you get like they get a bunch of set pieces right and he can like get his head on one which is which is like a an argument for him like for sure like im not diminishing that but i dont know its like outside of saka theres no one id be excited to bring in right now theyre theyre the man city defense right now is they will they will make one or two huge mistakes this arsenal defense a match at this point and i theres theres something going on there and hs h saka i think are they will get their points a huge concern with the arsenal attack is just like how bad trer and martinelli have been just last couple weeks like trossard in particular this weekend was quite poor but theres just no magic anywhere else in the team right now in the midfield like r rice and god can moreno remember that gu name theres just not a huge amount of dynamism in that partnership yet i think there will be this is like this arsenal team is built for next season as far as im concerned well its just like i there was like at some moment when like it was like dean rice like does his best to try to create a goal by himself and im like is this like a problem is this like an actual problem that needs to get solved at this point which is that delan rice like doesnt want to be a defensive midfielder anymore and its like is this like is there a connection its a great player but its like setp delivery was complete was horrible against newcastle im just like are could they be creating better chances if he wasnt like soloing it where hes like im gonna run in im gonna be like vintage yaya tor and im just hes not doing thats just commentators loving like the the handsome pristine looking englishman irishman maybe so i feel like i feel like im like im seeing a little too much of it myself but i dont know i just i just i somethings going on with the defense and im not quite or maybe its just i dont know its only 10 weeks right its its still a cliche alert here brandon but its still a small sample right like i think i think by the second half of the season man city and arsenal will have figured it out and well be seeing a bunch of one nil and twonil matches right i think thats thats thats whats coming so for better or worse for worse that whats whats fun about that long as liverpool continue winning then youve got theres theres the drama absolutely theyll be drama like in terms of the table but i just mean like i do feel like weve seen the last couple years a bunch of these matches where its like they have you have two highly motivated teams playing a bunch of teams that like are locked into their spot right and so its just like one nil two n one n two n i gota all right last questions from neymar butland brandon he says this is more of an existential question at what point do you stop and ask yourself the question what is my team i feel as though ive been following so many pieces of advice and adding so many random players who im not sure about or not watch play with my own eyes yes i want to make fantasy fun again yes but i also want to make my own team my team again 100 how do i do that the answer is quite evident i think is you have to stop all non always cheating content seeking advice taking advice looking at other peoples team the whole the whole when fantasy content and discussion is at its best and its something we strive for we dont always achieve is what lets talk about fantasy in terms of how much did you have a good week a bad week did you watch any matches was it cool i dont want your excels okay i dont i dont this isnt not like a this is not meant to spirited rant baseball was better before moneyball like anyway this i know what you mean though this question resonates with me because i find myself in this position all the time like foden just to he is like my example for everything on this episode that was a decision that i made without necessarily look looking at for advice or consulting any tables or anything like that like i did it was all me and still when i look at my team right now theres something about the aura that it puts out that doesnt feel like something that i necessarily wanted or missing a six million goalkeeper is right come on you got to if thats your calling card you got to honor its like the who are the water bandits or who are the guys in home alone the wet bandits the wet bandits they had the argument like we cant turn the water on because thats how theyll catch us and hes like no but we got to have a calling card so even if its like is to your detri to be fair joe pesi who didnt want to do that was validated in the end right cuz they said we found all these we have all these other crimes where they did the thing so now we can retroactively its fine that character did get his come up in the hit movie cin which we talked about last week i think cra what they did to the wet bandits in that cornfield thats true daniel stern hes in the you cant see him but he goes into that he goes into that shallow grave first i think that would be incredible if it was part of cino was part of the home alone universe came out on the same time its very possible but like i think its i think youve got to make sure that there is your dna in your team otherwise youre 100 g to be not going to have fun unless youre like winning the fpl and thats thats hard thats how tight rope i think you just this was me a year or two ago and the answer is you just have to drastically reduce your amount of consumption i think of fantasy content again i hope you continue to listen to this podcast if youre an hour in then you then i think youre a youre a fan or a supporter or whatever but like theres a lot of like i just dont spend time on twitter anymore that was the way that i saw this right like i just i was just on there too much i was watching too many teams and i it just gets in your head and then its its honestly like theres a bit of like fear of missing out right youre just like ah man like everybodys going for this player if he if he delivers and and im on here all day on saturday or whatever im just going to be kicking myself and feeling like a the biggest idiot for not doing that but if youre not on these spaces all day then that stuff cant hurt you right and and so i think thats you can go the other way and be like like when they when they dont do well i get to have shoden for it or whatever but like thats not like the greatest emotion either right like its its its not like the healthiest way to be like im just like playing to root against people or whatever right so its like better to just like again this is like a the big themee for this year but its like focus on your mini leagues like like focus on that worry about that world and then its like what are the what are the people in your mini leagues what do their squads look like right like maybe youve got to be the one who sends the email every week or gets the the mini league mate dossier and distributes it right like the way you do brandon twice you do it for two different leagues i love i love my mini league mates exactly and its like so like invest in that stuff and then i think it doesnt matter so much like you wont worry so much about whether you have like the right players or the right template or whatever practically speaking though how do you make sure you have good players you like who are still good fantasy assets so its all well and good to say well just fill your team with guys you like and thats how you end up with like adam wharton in your team i think like youve got to use like well you have to like you have to be like a little bit of strategically smart about some of this stuff right and you got to have some common sense and i think i will say though that even though ive reduced my consumption im still i you i have two different like fpl review which we talked about in this podcast before and ml tum these like services where they just like produce numbers right and believe me like i am not just like picking the stuff thats thats thats generated from there nor are you right we certainly talk about them and theyre interesting but that at least always gives me a but like listen like theyve had bruno has been at the top of these charts for like 10 weeks right so like clearly like it is not for like months for so long as well right just has been doing nothing he got an assist last week and so but there that at least i think gives you like a little baseline right like the mel talk thing i think its like 199 right its like nothing and then you like and then you can at least like pull up a little data chart be like okay because its like a like okay i see like maybe i should look at these five players just because theyre all at the top of the chart and they werent necessarily on my radar and then you look and youre like ah right its like its like man united right where youre like i didnt realize they played lester if switch and everton the next three right and so maybe i should be considering them more seriously stuff like that for sure all right you can do this i think by christmas your team will have a little bit more flavor im sure of it neymar butland also change your change your fantasy team name to neymar butland fc i think that sound sounds a bit like leroy jenkins doesnt it leroy chickens si all right brandon lets wrap things up here thank you so much for listening i am feeling by the way that fall forward all of a sudden its hit me like a like a like a brick just one brick not a ton of bricks but one big bri like a huge brick and cant be a loadbearing

night Thursday Night Football interal break after this weekend ah boom that's bad yeah that's bad we got so many questions because all the questions I didn't want to read last week combined with new questions didn't get answered they didn't get answered no one stepped up didn't get addressed yeah no one stepped up for us right and then we have our teams but I I mean we'll do that a bit tomorrow too on the live stream so yeah but we need to do more than we need to do a bit on that tonight too because I'm I'm at se same someone dm' me who was it it was [ __ ] bear bear Creeks he said I'm couple days late listening to the P but you said you were lost at sea you know what helps if you're lost that se piece of wood [ __ ] [ __ ] he's right though um well let's just talk about wood we got some twoo Long Good Wood questions Vikings said regarding your discussion on wood on Monday it does feel like buying yesterday's points as a non-owner we've been in these situations with almeron gundo lingard Etc this level of output doesn't feel sustainable I can compare it a bit with your take on Lis Diaz earlier in the season red hot start you guys said it was it was going to cool off it did why would it not do the same with wood and then Belo said are you still undecided on wood you both talked for a long time about he's the best Striker then you say his fixures are terrible but if he's the best Striker than his fixtures don't matter which is it and why haven't you actually transferred him in yet and I feel all of those things exposed yeah I feel you're not supposed to actually listen to the words we say like I don't want to hear them back that's prob stop giving yeah they're supposed to just go float away and never return after every pod is over I take my Little Men In Black pen and I flash my eyes with it and I go go back two hours before I'm like oh I have no idea what just happened that's the way it should be um well we're a couple days removed from our wood conversation and you know I've been I've been tinkering like I'm on Wild Card the amount I've been playing with combinations the last few days many combinations just going in out snip snap in out snip snap I where are you at today Thursday I don't think that much has changed if I remember correctly where I'm just like he's so obvious that everything we say about not getting him is just an excuse because we're sad about the points we didn't have it also just there's some sort of bias where it never feels good to transfer in the guy that everyone else already owns and is getting points from you just feel like you're it's not a bias you you don't want to buy you want to buy love you don't want to buy High yeah like you're buying high and you feel like you're a transfer behind yeah like I'm just barely catching up I'm behind in points and I'm just getting the guy that you already own so it feels doubly bad that said he's [ __ ] cheap he's really [ __ ] good and he has awful fixtures as bad as it gets and he's way over performing as XG yeah I mean how do you see him because I was trying to look more at him compared to the other Strikers I mean to me it's really like strand Larson and wiissa still stand out to me in this you know sub eight million bracket um you know wiissa has homeor think about him homeborn myth at Everton home Lester and then it gets a bit tougher so it's really just a few game we run um strand lson though has all three promoted sides in the next seven game weeks with you know a couple of tricky away at FM's going to be a tough one home bournemouth's probably going to be a tough one and at Everton we don't know what kind of shape they'll look in December um but then it's West I mean they they have a really good run for for about seven games so they had the hard they had the worst fixtures to start the season so now they're getting the reward reaping the rewards of that right right right right and then somehow they have another Murderers Row again like I they just have like chunk yeah there's no which for us is kind of good I mean there's no smattering of tricky one in between a couple good ones but yeah um like I still like he still keeps coming to the front of the line to me just because I'm looking at my team and kind of where things have been going wrong and I feel like it is the like I'm not setting myself up to stockpile where I can just sit for four game week and just everything's in good shape yeah and then I can make a big swap like where which I tried to do and I you know to ill effect and getting strand Larsson to me looks like a pick that I can just set and forget for you know a good seven games and Wood versus wood where I'm going to feel like right we keep talking about the fixtures of chasing points or you know we're going to have the wrong side of the norm like normalizing back to the mean or whatever ever and also with like at Arsenal where you're going to probably want to B like he you know he has these fixtures that you're just like he's probably not going to do anything in these games and yeah it's just it's still it's is this just a a tsunami of events where wood is just GNA keep W could just score 20 goals this year I mean every season is a small sample size,1070,okay welcome to frid of me life milone this walsh whats up bud chilling dog thursday night thursday night football interal break after this

that comes to mind for me is LJ Larry Johnson easy easy two yeah okay probably the best two of all time I think he switched later to like 24 or something but when he was on on our team he was number two love that yeah don't love my score uh another huge red arrow I just one return Rogers Rogers only return except for seeno third on my bonus Point Palmer Bath and aumo clean were my other returns so the other players were two two two one two two two two lot of TW pretty bad it's just like how the [ __ ] am I really how can you pick 14 out of 15 [ __ ] idiot [ __ ] who can't get a single [ __ ] goddamn return like it actually seems when you think about it harder to pick 11 starters who get one or fewer returns oh yeah it's definitely it is to pick 11 started to get more than that yeah I mean if you just gave yourself the a pool of you know pick 11 players from these 45 players insane it would be difficult to get a grouping of them where you get one or less returns one or less it's it's insane yeah cannot rest Rico Rico you know Rico doesn't I mean it doesn't matter if he played he gets [ __ ] two points anyway they [ __ ] suck but Palmer we both Captain Palmer he he's flagged now because lassandro red carded him but didn't get a red card I mean everything's a [ __ ] disaster Leandro is problematic he's uh he's a [ __ ] pig I hate that Fu he's real yeah he's he's a real high level scummer the two like dirty arguably dirtiest players in the league Romero and Leandro both had their red card moments this week Romero managed to injure himself which made it feel a little bit better love to see that yeah because it's just like our ball don't lie moment it's like you deserve to be injured um nether got a red card yeah leandro's something I feel like Romero's been a little bit better um got there I think he hasn't thrown as many leg Breakers as he you know used to under the previous regimes but uh Leandro Martinez is just a is a really disgusting person yeah yeah but yeah so is my team all right but your team's a little bit better because I mean my team is the same as your team I just had salanki so I mean I got 45 pulling up trees yeah in a week where most people struggled to you know hit four yeah I mean I was a few points above the average but uh yeah I mean I was in all sorts go at like I was putting in minus I was putting in minus 16s and you were done Sunday happened and I get the points and uh and Rogers got points and I was like okay maybe I won't take a minus 16 this week I still might you know I mean I still might do something to feel something but uh yeah it just feels like it's sort of I'm feel like I'm walking in quicksand or something and I'm just not really moving and nothing's nothing's fun and it's just a real slog and drudgery you know yeah we both save yeah I got a massive red arrow you you basically got a gray Arrow but it does sort of feel like like what the [ __ ] are we doing like no I went down don't don't twist it you went down 20K I feel like that is a gray at this stage my FPL page is showing a red circle with a white Chevron on it it's a red nice Chevron name drop but um no big deal yeah well neither of us went for Mo neither of us did the like aggressive like Holland a mo move which you know a lot of people did I mean he's he's basically the same ownership in in our mug league as Holland right now and all everyone who owned him capped him as they should he was easily the best cap and he came through barely um barely but came through um I mean he had a one-on-one and and the world e but well that's not like Holland didn't miss any chances I mean [ __ ] hell we Captain Palmer anyway so yeah Palm jokes on us but his friends Miss chances to deny assist that's what we were up that's why got a bath though hey we take a bath hey we take a bath more points in Holland get [ __ ] yeah huge um let me update the leagues November mug leaders according to FF game we because the game's not updated yet Evert van Balon and Eddie tied of first cam Anderson and Ross Logan tied for second bent schen Bower in third place good J by all of you there's a another short month because there's an international break soon so maybe maybe a good mug month and then ski card leading the public league same as last [Music] week what's up where do where to begin I I feel like there's a lot of talking points today um I mean I need I have some selfish talking points that I want to go over with you but uh mean I think the first thing is probably just talking about defense is really seems important right now because yeah it's brutal a lot of us are sitting here with a lot of money in defense and it seems [ __ ] stupid yeah I know I mean Josh B said seriously are Trent and gab worth it and and barck my entire defense has four returns in five game weeks since I wild card it feels low even most defens is struggling asses from Arsenal Liverpool Chelsea where's the line between my picks are bad and I should change them and my picks are in a down period and will come good and that's really the big question right is like do we start using free transfers in a place where we didn't think we were GNA have to and didn't never wanted to use freeze right yeah um I mean I'm pretty out on Trent like he's just not attacking enough to Warrant the price tag honestly I mean to me he's just not right he's playing so much traditional right back he's not overlapping he's not really getting in the final third more than a couple times a game in threatening positions and you know he's seven and it's sort of like was looking at him with glass half full for a while and giving him the benefit of the doubt but I think we have a large enough sample size under slot to to look at him as being just he's just a right back you know he doesn't do the same things that we're used to seeing him do under Klo and at seven it's just an insane outlay I get that he's good on bonus because he you know takes corners and you know creates chances but it's just not wor I mean I just can't he has one assist it's game of 10 he started every game it's like that's just not and it feels like that's about right like maybe that's [ __ ] a joke listen our old pod okay so there were a couple in game weeks one two three six seven game weeks it was oh another two big chances that weren't scored but that's that wasn't scored you know's a center back but it's that's the noise associated with assist where it's like I know but he shouldn't be on one he should probably be on like four or five well I think that would be if he was coming in with every single chance he created was having a having a return but say he had three say he had two more assists you know okay he has six more points that would be six more points than he has right now but I still just don't feel like he getting enough opportunities and enough reps because in years past he would have it because he would have had the ones that he's missing and then more right he's just the volume isn't there I feel like you know what do you I mean are you seeing it similarly or you still him all I mean I'm just he's doing like here's the guys who are around him in in FBR ref's XA it's mat three assists McNeil three assist Saka seven assist Savio two assist bumo somehow zero T you know almost t with Trent foden one and Palmer five like those are like that's the cluster of the highest in the league and it's like yeah you know you should probably be on three even if you just look at like the XG of the chances created two and a half three and you know like two to three is fair a lot of guys are on [ __ ] seven you know and they're just over overperforming right like Saka and yeah but they also sometimes get the rebound assist and the FPL assist that Trent's not get I'm just real assist yeah yeah but yeah I don't know you think it'll just come good well for me the main thing is whether you believe in the clean or not which I do you know like obviously Brighton's tough Arsenal's tough Chelsea's tough those are the last three they didn't keep it clean in any they still have City and Newcastle coming soon but you know home Villa Southampton at Everton you know good run after the Newcastle game those are all very cleanable and if the cleans come and he's still creating big chances every game and you know in the easier games I think he'll get a lot more space too like in Villa where they don't press the backline at all then you know it's not just an assist that's plus three points and it's an assist that's plus six points because if they keep it clean and he gets an assist he's going to get Max bones and you know so possibly for me I'm just pretty comfortable chilling but I think that like probably for you and probably for a lot of people listening it's not really it's not as simple as being like do I believe in Trent or not it's more like do I want to take the money out of Trent to turn so and so into premium yeah and that's where the conversation becomes a lot more difficult and a lot more team specific right it's like if you can turn turn you know I don't know foden to Saka next week or something like that yeah is that worth taking a million you're like probably yeah probably yeah because I I think Trent's going to have the most points of all the Defenders at the end of the season provided he doesn't get injured and also I don't think it's going to be worth 7 million like I don't two different conversations right like but they all fact they're all points of you know points on the column whatever sheet to figure there's other people who just have Trent and you know Palmer and wood and Mo and what like they're not considering getting rid of Trent right because their just team is just good and they just get points every week because they have Dom and wood and DJ and already have Mo in place you know what I mean so I do think the team context matters a lot because like my team feels weird and bad because I've been doing badly you're you probably feel bad weird and bad about your team because you've been doing badly last few weeks and it's like yeah that's the obvious place to get the money then get the money yeah I mean it just also feels like you know there are no clean sheets are hot lava and I still believe that Liverpool are the best defense and it just still feels a little bit silly to be putting seven here for you know I I don't know you know I mean just looking around there're all these four five it's just like you're rolling Dice and you know I have issues elsewhere in my team and you know freeing two and a half million here goes a lot further than just keeping Trent like that's you have to make a decision right so like I think Forest is a great example their underlyings are incredible they're just a [ __ ] really really good team nuno's this is a perfect Nuno team doing a perfect Nuno job right they have two cleans in the last three you know the red card obviously helped but do you believe that nfo are going to keep cleaning you know at or better than Liverpool like I don't they played home Palace at Lester Home West Ham yeah and Liverpool played Home Chelsea at Arsenal Home Brighton so it's like I just don't know if we should be overreacting to like three really hard games where they didn't keep it clean and then they have three pretty tough games in the next four yeah yeah so I mean these are the kind of things yeah where they're not I mean they've conceded four goals in the last three games which is not a lot of goals and they have no cleans in those three games so it's like yeah you're looking at these things of you know well we need them to still get the random clean in the game we for to be hit theice that and it hasn't happened so far and you know no I mean I think you can you're we're not looking at this from a pace for pace of you know our nfo going to be keeping Li but for 2 and a half million you know they don't need to keep Pace you know they need they can lag behind a little bit and you know you're still in okay shape or you know that kind of thing and yeah it's hard I mean it's like we were just talking about assists I think like the other noisiest thing in FPL is [ __ ] yeah the [ __ ] you know one dumbass mistake or one dumbass deflection your team you're [ __ ] holding flecken as is on a [ __ ] 19p pointer and then Harry Wilson accidentally chips him with like his back heel on a volley and you're just you know [ __ ] you know whatever that's that's cleans baby um yep yep but yeah I mean I think that that is like a big talking point right now because mainly because of teams like nfo Brighton I mean Fulham are okay these teams were I think have been playing better yeah they've been playing better but play once a week also yep also that but like just raw non-penalty XG against I mean NFL's second best in the league right now yeah yeah bypo which tracks I mean watching them play that's what it it looks like you know I mean it looks like new it really is like vintage Nuno wolves like that year where they were great and they finished seven backto back years yeah yeah and Jim had you know 25 returns every year and they they scored at most two goals a game and they conceded at most one goal a game and that was just every game all year yeah and they look like a better version of that team because they have more Pace on the wings and they have higher quality of players and they hit on the counter a bit better so you know yeah they're obviously not going to fish in the top four but they you know I think some yeah they could finish seventh I mean there are a lot of bad teams this year yeah yeah it's like if you're wildcarding right now yeah it's hard to imagine a world where you're not at least doubling nfo defense right like you're definitely going like sells Ana right or something like that or cells M or sh sure yeah and you rotate the defender and you have the keber sure I mean so we're we're hyperfocusing on Trent just cuz he's 7 million and we both have him I think and I've been thinking about getting rid of him all weekend but I mean gardial is also just very difficult to make a to get a handle on because [ __ ] I mean this isn't also a team that's just you know they're cleaning at the same rate as like Lester basically and he just seems to score a goal every other game which is what he's been doing over the past five or six out of seemingly nowhere he just pops up on the back post and just saves his [ __ ] ass in get pointer biggest worldy of all of them like forget about scoring from outside the box that header was [ __ ] insane insane header yeah and I mean you know you've been and we've been talking about him as being just a certifiable donger it's still just he's taking point oh like there's not a one in the 10th place of the XG chances he's getting and he just keeps scoring and I don't know it's killing me dude it's killing both of us it's killing us in an immense way because he so highed my final decision on my Wild Card Rico combination of players or gard and I went with Rico who has what six eight 14 15 points since I wild carded and gard's probably on like let me just check right now to kill myself 7 9 10 n yeah 30 20 29 yeah 36 it's just like that's that could not have gone more badly and it feels completely unsustainable and insane cuz they've kept one [Music] clean yeah in these fixtur like that's the other aspect of this where it's you know they've kept one clean in you know Bournemouth Southampton wolves Fulham nuke like yeah their defense is [ __ ] terrible and Rico is an awful pick he's just an awful pick totally wrong on him and it's a hold him though I he start but like I expect him to start most of the games going forward I mean he hasn't started three games and we're on gameweek 10 Kyle's back he doesn't do anything they don't keep cleans but Kyle was the worst player on the pitch yeah so that's a fact for what a factor for what for Rinko getting minutes getting [ __ ] slapped by I'm just you know it's just Rico is just the most unreliable minutes play on a team that doesn't keep cleans who has three games a week yeah until February yeah I'm like what am I doing here like this is going to be pain and bad and it's just going to be bad so I want Even though yeah I mean even though he's really cheap it's almost like Munch's hostage situation with him because I feel like I have to start him every week never gets me points like and I just find other things to do where I'm like if I just get rid of him as fast as as soon as I can and put anybody else in I mean I think I I'm not going to not come ahead on that like I just I feel like I need to just God we're both free from right now this is a this is a dark episode well it's dark I mean the only person I don't hate is honestly he h his little hand but he he posts on his own personal Instagram I'm [ __ ] fine and I'm starting midweek fine his fine he's doing yeah he's doing fine reliable new only reliable injury news player in the [ __ ] league and then you know that doesn't even and I have I mean I don't know if you've see this differently but I have no hope for City defense to just become more solid I mean is there any case for that happening the case would be would have to be some guys get fit in the international break who R that's the case no not Roder but like gundo it looks like he's running a is supposedly wasn't fit aan hasn't been training Kyle's not training like they're all [ __ ] [ __ ] up like they're at Brighton this week like they should lose heavily they should just lose this game yeah yeah I expect them to lose the game yeah I don't know what the [ __ ] to do with r man I mean this is sort of more postmortem but I might as well let you know cuz I I wrote it down while I was getting ready for this pod you started on postmortem you've never even written postmortem I started on my notes yeah I I did the same thing last year I just paint copy paste stuff that I see or think about all right so I mean I start the season with Nico Williams right gameweek one team because I Y believe in for we both believe in piece of the wing back want a piece of the defense they're going to be a good defense you know he keep he kept me one clean and then he got dropped basically I don't goko or Nico Williams yeah no difference there yeah handshake the thing that I wrote down that's interesting to think about maybe for future fbl Seasons maybe it'll come back get repacement yeah I didn't get I still believed in the team but I went away from forest yeah probably because partially because of like a away Liverpool away Brighton in four and five sure but look now and they're [ __ ] cleaning every other week and randomly scoring [ __ ] goals like Ana and like whatever and good God you know I could have just gone over to any one of them felt completely fine gotten a lot of points didn't do that just something for you know the future yep yep yep yep but uh yeah long story short and we haven't even mentioned Arsenal Defense AR yeah so where are you at on Arsenal RS casting God I mean I don't want to make [ __ ] up and have Nate yell at me as I did [ __ ] mad yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I still am sitting here and I'm like if I say something I get in trouble I still think they're in the title race and a great [ __ ] team and I know it sounds absolutely insane after lost straw loss um they need the international break badly um odard supposedly back soon maybe he'll be back for tell us yeah he'll definitely tell us'll tell us um you know Gabrielle's half knocked they don't have a left back they're all [ __ ] up in in a lot of ways he also doesn't use any of the depth which is a ett a personal problem but I don't know what to do I I still believe in the team long term I'm sitting here with Gabrielle every week I'm sitting here being like Oh I kind of want Kai and Saka maybe soon as the fixtures turn who are just like not Kai's just doing a defense stick with defense cuz I want to talk about Arsenal more later but long story short I think still going to come through I mean the numbers are still great um gonna come good I think they'll come good I think the way they play yeah and asn't as bad is as it is on the eye and they're they're one of the worst watches in the league y I think they'll keep cleans because that's all they play for um what do you think are you also holding well I have Rya so it's it's less painful with Rya but I mean I have been diddling around with taking him out for a million I what about in in fantasy Champions League do you ever make keeper transfers every week I have made a goalkeeper transfer every sing are you doing well in fantasy Champions League a lot better than I am in FPL I just put it that way okay I'm just trying to draw parallels here I'm no I'm it's not it's not lost on me but no yeah I'm broadly with you on Arsenal I agree with you just the the pessimistic way they play and the players are still fit it's just the the overarching impact that odard out has had on the team is just cannot possibly be understated enough I mean what they look like without him and what they look like with him and it just touches every aspect of the team um so it's just the sooner he gets back the better I'll feel about them but in the meantime I mean they have been taking on water like very heavily right I mean the Newcastle performance was really startling to me because they were [ __ ] awful yeah they were awful and you know they let the goal up relatively early and then Newcastle stopped playing and arsenal were happy to not keep playing so the thing right that's the thing with clean sheets is it's so it's so fickle it's like that's the thing god tier cross and one really sick header and it's gone and they can see nothing else the rest of the game but I think that that's I don't even know if that's good for them because I don't know either they didn't try and win so bad for them in the title but maybe still good for Rya and Gabrielle like I don't know yeah yeah I I don't know but they're hard to put a finger on terrible yeah because they're they're also like their underlyings defensively and you know that's the same thing with with Liverpool like the underlying defensive stats have been really good throughout these games where they haven't been cleaning so it's so painful because both of them are on this really prolonged stretch of not doing it and we all have a lot of money tied up in that and um and it's going poorly but the other aspect too here though I mean we have our last International break coming up but the pile up is coming you know and they's just going to be playing more games than ever so you know we then it gets back into the ageold question we have every year of you know is this good for the defense because they attack less and they just kind of s stand around a lot more or is it just bad cuz they're all [ __ ] blowing and they're tired and you know most of the teams in the division aren't playing twice a week and all the bad teams have better players and blah blah blah blah blah so you know I'm I'm I'm still keeping half an eye on that and just thinking like how are they be usually in the pileup the better teams actually the Gap is actually wider usually because they're used to playing three games a week the other teams the bad teams are not and and they and they usually control the games or the bad teams don't right so I feel like that's actually a little bit of an advantage but sure I see that yeah but yeah I mean like I feel like I'm in a [ __ ] insane stylum where like every [ __ ] live stream robot team that we talk to on Friday has like poro Leaf Davis and cardiio and I'm sitting here with like well I have Trent and gab who are way better than all those guys so I'm going to do good and then they 20 points and my guys get two points every week so yeah somehow I don't know F I don't know I don't know mentioned there but yeah he's not contributing he's just in every team that's why I'm like bad bad bad and then they get points yeah well he's just as bad as Trent and he's a million and a half less so jokes on us I guess should go to B the the other aspect to the defense and all this [ __ ] that's really bizar is like the the Midfield is just suddenly like such a baron Wasteland where there's you know the four premiums and then bumo and then nothing and then sub six million picks basically you know you're leaving out foden and Bruno tactically I am not wellow I don't know if that was tactically but I mean they're there but I don't know foden has killed me's killing you yeah fod he's got the most point Dodge of any player in the [ __ ] league in this stretch only exclusively blanks except for his sub on and get a random assist on a corner against wolves blank every other [ __ ] game and he all he's doing is creating big chances and taking good shots that are like a whisker wide he is absolutely [ __ ] murdering me Bruno got a pen 10-pointer again all the robot teams Etc [ __ ] kill me I don't know what the [ __ ] pens are good but I just make that point to say like we have all this money tied up in these premium Defenders and typically the you know make a Mill and a half here gets us to the mid-priced Midfield bracket and there's you think people would go like e to some amazing pick's five five yeah and there just isn't one so yeah it's also like almost like you have to either gut your defense to get one of the premiums you don't have right or you just have your dick in your hands and you finger cross while your dick's in your hand and say I hope this comes good or you finger your [ __ ] when your dicks in your hands and just hold your bad pics and keep your now we're cooking now we're now we're feeling something yeah CU [ __ ] dude yeah because like you said I mean it's like we were talking about Trent as if that enables you single-handedly you know Trent to canate or Trent to 47 Ana or some [ __ ] but that doesn't do [ __ ] that takes you from [ __ ] five six midfielder to booma who you already [ __ ] own who doesn't play who doesn't even start or Diaz who doesn't start who's on the worst team in the [ __ ] league shoots once every three games so you need five million or six million to go up to you know Saka no like that doesn't even get you Mo it's all [ __ ] everything's [ __ ] everything's [ __ ] so another thing I wanted to touch on was just like who are we all going to want and if I feel like this is a who are we going to want in a few weeks kind of moment because I'm having a really hard time looking at the landscape and thinking about you know okay Arsenal are in a bad moment Liverpool are doing the things City like Villa Spurs like who are we going to want in a few weeks like how can we get ahead of the curve and I don't really know what the an is but I wanted to throw that at you to see if you I also don't know what the answer is I'm looking at fixture ticker in front of me right now I mean listen we're obviously going to talk about Ally because you own Olli and it's been sort of not that fun for you but after Liverpool he's home Palace at Chelsea home Brenham home Southampton wish I had him for those that's that's a name to add to the list and s menu we both already own that's good good job by us boo we own good job by Us Brighton are about to go on an insane run I mean they will probably take points off of city and then they have a really good run um have a really long good run after Arsenal it's hard to pull picks off of Brighton though yeah that's true um does sort of seem like no one's that nailed but wels I I've been shouting WBS for week weeks yeah K he just wasn't playing defense this game he played right wing against got like two yeah good prettyy good chances and scored one of them um I mean where are you at with ch like do you think endod is is someone who's going to be really important or I just think he's fantastic yeah I think you could do a lot worse than like you know 12 through 22 they're Lester Villa Southampton Spurs Brenham Everton Fulham ipswitch Palace Bournemouth Wolves yeah I think we want more than just Palmer um and uh I mean he's sort of like I mean he's better than Brennan Johnson but in a Brennan Johnson sort of way [ __ ] no I know but I'm saying in a Brennan Johnson sort of way he just gets like minimum one big chance every game yeah what about isok yeah esok big fan playing really well you were you were all about him where where are you with Bruno seriously I mean he's eight2 yeah he's been putting up good leg Yeah Lester ipswitch Everton coming up new guy's coming in who speaks Portuguese from Portugal I don't know if you know this but Bruno's Portuguese I know that yeah yeah yeah I mean he's he's obviously a pick I mean as evidenced by hland taking a bad touch and Bob Sanchez doing something [ __ ] dumb ending in Bruno getting a free 10-pointer that guy's the pick right like if he doesn't even have to do anything but someone make a really [ __ ] dumb mistake after a bad touch and he gets 10 free points that's pretty [ __ ] good my whole team didn't get 10 points yeah but he also hadn't gotten 10 free points all year I mean before that he had [ __ ] 23 points in nine game weeks so he's averaging he was averaging like not even three points a game so but he's been putting up big numbers very consistently I mean I do think that like we both have knowledge at some points during the season like wof got away with that one again yeah like there were those Striker games where he was just like hitting the post yeah but yeah putting up big numbers um he will continue to be the best player on the team old manager new manager interim manager doesn't matter um he's a steady hold yeah that's for sure I think the question is better suited to be like how do you compare him to any of the five premiums because I'm including foden in the mix and I mean it's just what what team it's a big two mil it's a big two mil difference yeah yeah it is so I don't know if that's a fair comparison and the only reason I'm comparing is because of what you said earlier right like a remove bumo from the situation I think he's 97% owned in the mug right so we all have him yeah so you're going from from someone probably pretty cheap and you're going to want to turn that into Bruno maybe but if you're if you're getting like three million you're already making multiple transfers right like you're either like getting out Holland or doing Trend and gab down or something like that so that's the reason why I'm comparing them to a premium because it's like okay well should you just find another 2 million and get Saka or is it worth it to like keep one of the aention guys and get Bruno up I'm trying to speak to like macro terms and talk about every team but long story short good hold he'll get pens and random points and he's fine and good right yeah feel like it's you know he he makes up the middle class with bumo yeah okay so let's go over to Villa cuz it's like what's the wild card team right now like what do you mean like like if you're wild carding right now and you're just like I want the best team like do you think Bruno makes that team I don't know does Holland even [ __ ] make that team I think I mean I still am standing on Holland like I think that it's gonna he's going to be fine and it's going to be okay I mean this sitters every week is good you mean yeah it's I think it's okay I mean to us like we are doing the edge thing that we wanted to do which was Point case in point not Captain him like at Bournemouth where he blanked yeah and we just didn't hit you know so like that is to me the the the way forward but I'm not willing to compromise by not having Holland and you know I like jamming Mo I'm like I don't think Mo's better like he gets worse chances every game than Holland and you know we talk about five points to four points for the goal blah blah blah but yeah no it's just that's not the the thing to me but um yeah I mean I think it's Holland wood some [ __ ] anybody else and then you have I think Palmer's in there Saka May it's either Saka or Bruno like bumo seeno and then defenses you know pick your poison like how much I think that's the biggest question is how much do you want to spend in defense because you could skimp on defense and you can have Holland Palmer Mo easily that's easy you easily make that team with wood and another budget forward TR Larson I think that's team basically off top my head no no I I think he just has that team off the top of my head yeah and that yeah it all comes back to defense in a weird way um Mo who's you know well on his way to another 200 Point Season the usual will he slow down in the second half he usually does they don't press as much as under clop so maybe he won't but yeah I mean he's he's [ __ ] phenomenal he's just unbelievable [Music] so where do you where do you see Saka in all of this like just looking cuz when I'm looking at my team like that's a pretty big question is if like I could easily get Saka like it would make me maybe I would have to sacrifice a little bit of a you know from getting a mid-price player to a budget play or something but like getting like him versus Bruno for example where maybe I could have a bit a little a little bit better of a like a you know spreading the money a bit better but yeah like is Saka just he's going to be in every team by game week like 14 because they're going to or something doing all the things again and he's just going to be [ __ ] it or is he someone that you can also kind of wait and see or like how priority byy is he knowing that you're kind of in the byow phase sir yeah I mean he's still pretty high for me I feel like a [ __ ] broken record right it's like all these picks that were good three weeks ago I'm sitting here being like no he's still a good pick and everyone else who's soaring past me in the overall overall rank doesn't have any of them right I'm like oh yeah Holland's still good and Saka is still good and Trent and gab and whatever but what I think I think Saka is still a great [ __ ] pick I would not buy him this week aru don't buy him in 12 either International break nfo is good you know that could just be a nothing weird game yeah then it starts um you know West Ham man united Fulham Everton Palace IPS brenford Brighton like yeah I just think you know odard will definitely be back by then other guys who probably won't go on International because they're all kind of dinged up right now that'll be good for them um and I think they'll just start winning game so yeah I think Palmer's still better and Palmer has that really really long long good run and that's why we both have him and then I think Saka is the probably next premium that you want long term sure okay what do you think I don't I I'm I'm a little bit more scatter brand about him honestly than you are just because you know it's he you know we we look look at him and talk about you know the Avenues that he has and [ __ ] and it's just like he's still not he just like trickles in these points that are just like he doesn't shoot that much no I know but like he doesn't shoot that much he just gets fouled 10 times a game plays out wide he doesn't come inside a lot like it's still a lot of the stuff from last year which I mean I know I probably sound like I'm in denial or something but yeah I mean he has three goals this year like it's like not that good and I don't think he should have more like you know so I mean look you know he finishes up the season with nine which would be like his lowest total ever and that would be assuming they don't get a few free pens they need some pens yeah yeah I mean he needs seven assists yeah but that's also is just like how many assists is he going to get on [ __ ] like Corner kicks like I don't know [ __ ] break the record maybe but yeah I don't know I just think he's so great and they build around him he's the best player on the team he's one of the best players in the country and the team the team what is it what is the [ __ ] thing people say rising tide whatever the fck ship yeah that for him yeah Arsenal get better pictures get easier I think he'll get better yeah like odard will let him come inside more more control in the final third will let him take more shots CU I guess it's you know I mean to me it is really like I don't think sun is at the races right now like I don't think he should be I know they have the I switch game but switch game um you know their fixtures are a little bit mixed coming up I know he usually you know scores against City and they're not a good team but um you know at 10 million with him playing wider than I've ever seen him play before a [ __ ] Winger like yeah the ca the only like it's hard to even make a case for Son of Brenan at this point to me if they do the same [ __ ] thing except Brennan gets big chances and sun doesn't yeah cuz pass and Sun can yeah basically yeah yeah no I'm with you on that so I mean it really does I think it it does kind of narrow down to Saka versus Bruno honestly of like if you're going to get another expensive midfielder assuming you're not getting rid of Holland to fun Mo and you have Palmer like that kind of is the question isn't it I guess so it's Sala on the way expensive end where you have to sacrifice something else Saka in the middle there who's just great and then Bruno if you don't want to sacrifice someone like if you want to keep salanki or Ali or like someone else in that kind of range and have kind of like two upper guys for me for me it would be like I could do like if I could if I wanted to get Bruno then I could get someone like ESO but if I wanted to get Saka I would have to get someone in the wood range m i I see what you mean yeah so that's like the difference yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I think Saka is way better than Bruno I mean if that's actually the question I think you know the pens obviously cancel each other out I'm not going to try and predict who gets more pens but Arsenal are way better and are going to score way more goals I mean I think that like I guess like my overarching take is Arsenal just had three hard fixtures Liverpool just had three hard fixtures them and City are still the three best teams in the league I think they'll come good long term but yeah it feels [ __ ] stinky and bad right now that's 100% for sure yeah because the I mean the other thing I wonder too is it's like you know Bruno plays ler EP switch and Everton the next three and you know it gets bad after that they play Arsenal NFL and City and we know how [ __ ] invisible he is in in big games I mean there's no no more bankable blank than him in a big game game so um like then I'm almost also they have a new manager like we don't even know what the [ __ ] yeah which you know to me with that middle I mean they can't be worse than they've been but you know either yes you know it's an unknown but is it you know throw him for a few and they have these good fixtures but whenever I've been doing that instead of like I wanted ESO before and they had tough fixtures and all he does is score so I'm like whenever I've been doing that instead of just get the player that I I prefer or then it just doesn't go as well you know for me I feel like it's that's that's where my regret for the mo thing comes in because all I've been saying all season is like yeah I just want to flip around the premiums for fixtures and so far that also hasn't really worked for me yeah I mean Mo's got 10 against Arsenal and 12 against Chelsea it's like well right right so yeah first of all getting rid of him he gets 12 and 10 but then also I didn't get him back for Home Brighton when I know he's the best Captain that's like exactly what I said we should be doing and he gets nine you know I'd still be on a [ __ ] red probably but it' be not 300K it' be 30k so yeah the big [ __ ] difference and then vill I mean I I need more you know I mean I'm so biased with Watkins it's out of control but buas which way I good or bad I don't know I don't know it depends on if he got points this weekend but yeah where like what do you like do you see Villa as different this year than last year the year before like what do you what's going on with you and Olli like you you know you I think I've seen almost every Villa game which is my they're always oness yeah yeah they play Sunday yeah not always Sunday but yeah a lot yeah a lot and they deserve it they finished fourth last year and they're a good team um they just got dismantled by Spurs but I think anyone who watched that game realizes that that was like basically an even game until you know the very end kind of meltdown moment yeah there was nothing happening Villa were isue for me with them yeah it's a big part of the issue um but it's also kind of what I expected I feel like when the thing that I expect happens I feel more comfortable with the assets if that makes sense like I expected them to just be [ __ ] annoying and all mcin does is put his ass in everybody's face and he goes down for he basically is Jordan IOU he's [ __ ] that's all he is yeah he's white Scottish Jordan IOU yes with a bigger ass and he just tries all he does is back that ass up and try and draw fouls his whole that's the whole [ __ ] thing was time waste and draw fouls and give the ball to Jacob Ramsey and let him try and like beat three people on the dribble that was the entire [ __ ] game surprised he doesn't do it it didn't work um I thought Rogers played well I mean Oly had a couple chances but it's just they're not an elite team so you know when you H they have fixtures where they're unfavored it usually doesn't go well owning their assets and that's the problem with you know at Liverpool this week at Chelsea and 13 you don't really expect them to score like more than one on the other end when they open things up and attack and let the guys run around they have been scoring pretty good goals and Duran might score yeah Duran scores Rogers is he going to score his big chance or not or is he going to assist the chance so I look at them and I see home again I mentioned this earlier home Palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home Southampton 15 I mean yeah I want Rogers and oi in all of those I want to start them both in all of those games yeah but you also have to look at them for at Liverpool and at Chelsea which is like it should balance out to put a lot of stress on these games where if they don't return you're [ __ ] yeah but largely they've been good and the good games and they and then they have nfo City Newcastle it's like well it's easier with Rogers cuz he's so [ __ ] cheap you just rotate him in out it doesn't really matter I mean he's kind of returned in every single game you've expected him to return I mean his returns are Lester Everton woles I switch Fulham and he BL bled yeah well okay first game games of the Season he was carrying a knock and and getting subbed early every game so he blanked Western blanked Arsenal fine blanked man united cuz no one played that game blank Bournemouth blank Spurs like he's good man like I I don't know what to say it just you kind of have to hold your nose when they have they have a bad fixure because it's going to be ugly but he still got a couple chances he easily could have scored in that game yeah and then like I feel like if he scored in that game we wouldn't even be talking about it we would just be like yeah he's just great ass that he just hold he just keeps getting like he's on like life support all the time I feel like though the the main thing that gets me with them is they just don't attack you know they they don't attack and he he doesn't have the free like Bruno right Manchester United They Don't Really attack I mean they they try and counter but they [ __ ] [ __ ] attack they're just bad they're bad but they send six guys forward all the [ __ ] ially they they'll throw the the guys forward but like Ali doesn't have the free goals in his back lock like in the back pocket which we don't think he might well I I mean it would just stun me if he took the ne I mean they might but that's the other thing is they don't get pens no [ __ ] they don't get pens they don't attack like no one's in the Box ever so how could they win a pen um also just way way less pens this year it feels like way less pens this year but just like I I'm with with you on the you know he gets a couple good chances of game and he will because he's that good of a player and I don't know if that's enough this year like looking you compare him to Bruno who we keep bringing up again right I mean he just can't keep up with them right like but even comparing him to like esok like how is he better than esok he's just not like they're playing too many games I don't think he is I don't think he subs and changes they don't attack they play all these games there's squads [ __ ] he Subs Duran on at 60 and then when they play together it's like I don't know what's going on and the they just they don't attack you know they just don't attack and so like you I just feel like there I every time I look at Watkins I'm just like again it feels like hostage taking it's if I had him I'd be feeling exactly the you got rid you ripped the bandaid off a few weeks ago part of wild card right isn't that when I got rid of him I don't know why you got rid of him but you you did a good thing I think whenever I got of it was part of a wild card part of like a triple move or some [ __ ] but I would better than wood he's not better than wood they attack basically but no one's better than wood they basically attack similar amount of times and he doesn't even have pens and he's three million more it's like probably not he might have pens yeah like how many forwards are better than Watkins it's many forwards like it's not two or three it's probably like seven yeah for the price of course of course to factor the price in yeah I think that's right I think that's right and yet I'd be sitting here as you are sitting here agonizing over home Palace home brenford home Southampton and not having him in those pictures is pointer in there yeah there's a 23p pointer quad return in there which he's [ __ ] done before and we do again and that's the [ __ ] brutal part of this game that feeling of if I do this the worst possible thing is going to happen to me which is this guy getting a [ __ ] haul is like FPL in a goddamn nut Chell I don't know how to get around that feeling and I don't know if that feeling is just us getting hurt a couple times and that's all we remember because usually that probably doesn't happen right no it doesn't happen and then our sins get washed away and then we move on to the next shiny it could not happen 10 times in a row and then the 11th time you get rid of fod he has hatrick and I'm like oh [ __ ] of course he has a hattrick God damn it I just got rid of him yeah so let's we haven't we haven't really mentioned the we haven't talked about anything well we're we're just talking we're just talking in circles I don't know what the [ __ ] no we're not talking in circles we're talking about stuff but let's let's talk about wood because we haven't mentioned he's 65 now scored again um he's the best Pi in the game he's the best striker in the league and the best pick in the game so their fixtures coming up home Newcastle at what their fixtures are soad so home Newcastle at rcast home ipswitch at City at United Home Villa at Brenham home Spurs at Everton at wolves you know we're we're in 2025 yeah it's all happening not getting them [ __ ] it I'm too [ __ ] depressed to get this guy now what what's the opposite of sun cost I've Sun my [ __ ] depression and I'm not going to solve it by getting the best player in the league so what am I doing if I'm if I believe everything I said earlier about [ __ ] Gabrielle and Newcastle have been playing better and Rico's fine I'm not gonna Panic then why the [ __ ] would I get Chris Wood well you know I mean one thing about chriswood that's an interesting one is like we might have just been really sarily Mis assessing and Mis categorizing him from the beginning because you know he's been with Nuno for two years and he's basically just been the best Striker not named Holland in the league since he's the best Striker including Holland [ __ ] Holland yeah fine whatever but so you know I you know we take it that you know we take it that we look at their opening 10 and it's been a lot of you know bottom half teams in there you know they played Liverpool they played Chelsea other than that you know you might sneak an eighth or a Ninth Place team but you know we're looking at bottom 10 teams and scored against Chelsea anyway sure scored against Chelsea and you know look fixtures breed form blah blah blah that just means that they're about to play tougher fixtures coming up which I just read the run out to 2025 and it's certainly more difficult than the first 10 games of the Season yes but like he's 65 they're playing in a way that maximizes his strength we make fun of how old he is but he's not that old I mean he doesn't have a ton of tread on his tires yeah you he misses a few games every year and he's he's you know he's really just played a handful of years so you know it's not like this is a player that's like broke in when he was 17 and he's been playing Top Flight football with 3,000 minutes like he's going to fall off a cliff and you know he doesn't he can't run anyway I mean the pace is in his game but you know he shifts his movement's good and headers like finding the poachers goals they get good they're good setpiece team like are the bad fixtures enough to just say you know we missed the points and he's it's going to dry up or is this just us finding more reasons to shoot ourselves in the foot that's what it feels like it's obviously that I mean me saying even me saying I'm not getting him made you laugh like why does that let's analyze that why is that funny it's funny because it's so [ __ ] stupid because he's better than Holland he's better than Salan he's better than [ __ ] everyone and we don't own him because and he's cheap but why like why wouldn't we both get him now yeah we should we should should be part of our transfers to should just be to get them we should get him in this week we should get him in every week every week that passes get him in once this week next week whenever doesn't [ __ ] matter I don't know what to say dude okay Aral at City you're start everyone's just going to start him like I I don't know I guess that's when you rotate in Rogers I mean is Rogers is home Palace home brenford and those two is that the five is that the five head where we should have him with the Rogers rotation for these couple yeah because I mean Rogers has the good ones that Oli has that I just named right home Palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home Southampton and 15 and would in those same weeks say at Arsenal at City at man united right that's just [ __ ] free right that's free real estate yeah I mean allegedly it's just like so stupid should obviously have him makes me want to [ __ ] die even thinking about that like you getting Dom obviously it worked out this week and me getting Darwin that same week that we both made our forward transfers and both had more money in the bank than we [Music] deserve and we both so obviously should have gotten wood that it was [ __ ] even on the Pod I was [ __ ] banging your head with a shovel being like no it's wood Wood's the best pick obviously get wood blah blah blah fast forward to Friday we're both getting in D and dar when you don't even like Dom and I hate him you hate Dom and Spurs and we're like obviously Dom and just like [ __ ] so much regret so much pain oh it's just [ __ ] the worst dude this is the worst of it I don't know what to do three freeze team sucks Holland sucks foden sucks I don't know [ __ ] to do dude wood it's it's still back to just like the fixtures for me I just look at the fixture I'm like insane they're not good so you know do I I know you you talking about so and so team doesn't attack right we were just talking about Villa and [ __ ] blah you know who really doesn't [ __ ] attack no no goddamn team yeah yeah but like then but also if you look at the fixtures and you take away at Arsenal at city they're pretty good so yeah I mean newcastle's fine it's not great at home you know they'll score they're not getting blanked in that game they'll score home is phenomenal yeah Atman United's probably fine although like you know nfo would this is you know here I am making more [ __ ] excuses like an absolute [ __ ] [ __ ] but I'm going to do it anyway my goddamn pod but like would and nfo should in theory be the type of team that doesn't like a goddamn pile up right yeah I mean like playing every three days for this fcking small Squad yeah like how much can a longa and Cho and Ana and Moreno and would run in a week like let's put that to the test I don't know dude I feel like a complete [ __ ] idiot and I'm lost at se right now would so I don't know what to do I should just bow down to the robot it'll tell me to just get wood and e that's probably the recommended M get an injured e get as a wood and Bruno that's what it'll say to me if I punch in my team right now I'm sure but um yeah so you going to get wood or what I don't know I mean it's the The Players I Want to remove the most are Watkins dipod and Trent and I was going to bring up dibling actually because the theory of rotating in Rogers works really well if you have an eighth ATT if Rogers your eighth attacker yeah but for me I have Archer and you have dibling so it doesn't work one of them plays and one of them doesn't but like I don't I don't want to start Archer anymore than I H already have right right and that's where like want to looking at the you know next month or two I want to move Rogers to be my eighth attacker I don't want to rely on him on a week on WE basis and so that's something that I'm really putting a high emphasis and value on of of getting rid of dibling because he's not you know he isn't isn't he is the false hope he's not what I was hoping he would become yeah and uh I'm ready to cash in there so I mean I can afford everything I can punch in in those three spots is phenomenal but I just don't know which combination of phenoms I want you know luckily they're all phenomenal though CU then that means feel it feels like I can't go wrong with The Replacements combination of phen so goddamn good it feels like I can't go wrong but I know I'm gonna pick the wrong ones and go it's gonna go wrong you know if I had to describe a f to someone who's never heard of the game I would say it's a game you just can't go wrong yeah you just get just get good guys and nothing bad ever happens you can't go wrong until you just want to die yeah well that's where I am I mean there's a lot of questions here but I just don't want to read them okay um so I think we'll just push them to Thursday maybe okay except for these two lifestyle questions we could do those before before we do that so I mean you don't really have too strong Vibes about anything you're just a mess I'm definitely a mess but I think everyone should get wood and I think Saka is better than Bruno those are the questions you as me right what I can I'll just do that like I can just do that take a hit get them in I mean Saka is at Chelsea this week I I'm very happy if you waited a week for it maybe but yeah but if I wait a like me waiting a week means that I start Walkins at Liverpool like give me Saka yeah I don't like that yeah like it's so the the waiting is less Advantage but the the other thing I can which might just be also a thing I could do is just get Bruno now inste of Saka and wait on Saka and Bruno's just placehold until I feel like making that switch I'm very fine with that too I mean at Chelsea is bad home NFL's bad you know like bad every week so far this season the big teams have kind of struggled after the international break I mean I could be wrong someone's going to [ __ ] comment oh Spurs beat [ __ ] well they're not a bigley 8 n whatever the [ __ ] I don't care but I'm pretty sure that that's basically how it's gone is like after the international break Liverpool lost one nil to Forest man city barely beat brenford Arsenal barely beat Spurs Chelsea got dominated by bourou that was the first International break next International break let me see Arsenal lost two nil to Bournemouth city barely beat wolves Liverpool barely beat Chelsea and now we're here and the next International break you know it's probably more of the same there's no reason for me to believe it won't be they come back slow all their best players are [ __ ] away 8,000 miles away in South America whatever um yeah wait on them F I'm fine with you waiting on Saka Bruno wood or something yeah yeah I mean I could also just get not hit keep Trent get Bruno and strand Larson you can't do Bruno and wood no I can't afford it and then get uh get wood for salanki after IP switch or something coia by the way we talked about COA on the live stream everyone's going COA everyone in Discord absolutely [ __ ] wanking to him getting an assist in one bones me and you sitting here saying I'd rather have the striker guess what he got a goal and two bones not one bone yeah yeah I mean yeah I don't know but that's that's another thing that's interesting to like I like Str Larson just being so slept on because everyone [ __ ] world has K you cuz I mean strand Larson is also kind of like lowkey a younger version of wood he's really good he's been really good I've all season I've been saying damn he looks [ __ ] great like I'm Psy he poaches and he's good work grade and you know he he's so I might I could do that I could do that not not hit I like him a lot not hit not hit do that you know but what do you think about Solani just long term like is this did this triple return he like oh yeah he's just definitely keep him through the tough fixtures and or is it like he's still too expensive compared to the wood and the I mean the triple return was like everything I feel like I was saying last week about Spurs is like all they are is inconsistent and that's yeah fine because every team outside of Liverpool City and Arsenal I expect to be inconsistent and Southampton they're very consistent too consistently [ __ ] [ __ ] but we got it we got it Spurs like that game was on such a knife's edge like I implore people who just watched highlights or something and are like oh my God Spurs were [ __ ] amazing to go back and actually watch that game cuz Villa could could have won that game 4-1 also like oi big chance goes in Rogers had another chance that goes in you know like that game could have fallen apart because of the way they play they play if so and so makes the one big Challenge and we like Davies wins that huge tackle that immediately led to a goal like literally two seconds later Spurs were scoring a tap in and that's just how they play and other times the Center back misses the challenge or whatever and then the other in un clean in clean 2V1 3v one and that's just how they are so they're going to have these games like the palace game especially I mean that's the worst I've seen them play in the [ __ ] a year where they just all their buildup [ __ ] doesn't work and everything's broken up and the Press isn't working they're just terrible but they're just going to have these games whether it's Villa West Ham whoever where they just blow the [ __ ] doors down and it feels silly to me not owning at least one of their attackers like what even if it's not Dom it's BJ whatever because you want a piece of the four ones yeah and I think the four ones will keep happening as will the losing three Nils you know that also happen that's fair I mean I could hold Dom and bench him bench him in the city game yeah sure could do I mean Brennan Johnson is just an all-time hilarious player I can't get over this guy yeah it's hard to cuz I mean watching that game too is he's just not playing like he just wasn't playing he doesn't ever play didn't do anything just over there I don't know what the [ __ ] he's do I don't know what he's doing what he's involved what he's where he's running like what his role is or what he's supposed to be doing and then he just pops up he's just like hey I'm here I did a goal he's like okay by I'm done that's what's up [ __ ] you I did a go he and then he vacates the premises again and he just and he had one shot and it was a tap in that's it he's ad him done he's three true outcomes he's either going to D walk strike out all right that's who he is it's great but so Salan yeah I mean it's good pick and PJ good pick yeah salanki could be a could be a longer yeah salanki could be a longer term and a little bip and Bop yeah I kept saying to people not just you is like I know you know his last two games or whatever it was three games in a row he had three bad games in a row but like the reason his season stats were still so good is because the two games before that were absolutely monster insane games yeah that balances out to good pick right so like he's GNA have these games where oh he didn't get a shot this [ __ ] didn't work the Press didn't work whatever and then he's going to have games like this where five minutes he feels like he got a triple rout well I think the other interesting thing too just to to note on him is I mean he did just get there so he just got there and he was injured for a game one yeah and an just can't stop you know wanking to how much Salan does for the team with his yeah link up play and just all his movement and blah blah blah all that stuff so you know you do also expect just maybe the teammates kind of learn how to find him better cuz it's it's it is very interesting watching like him play is like they just never find him you know and it's we know his movement's good we've been seeing his movement be good for thousands of minutes so he's mov on Bournemouth and it's like you know they're just he's playing with better players for the first time in his life since he was a child on Liverpool and he played like 20 minutes for them so you know you'd expect that that should get better with time and you know that that could happen too which is you know yeah and he has that thing that we always used to complain about with Kane where he would like Kane would drop deep build and then not have the athleticism to make it in the box but he gets to the [ __ ] box that's how he gets that got the goals right like he comes deep he does a little wall pass whatever gets to the box and then it's like either him or BJ are gonna get this tap in yeah he's not that slow yeah so yeah I don't know I think he's a long-term good pick but uh all right so yeah we move a lot of these things to next to Thursday maybe I'll sit tight with them all right so what do we got for lifestyle we had a couple ones lifestyle a couple questions fed said orange juice with or without pulp asking a couple diabetics about a sugar water yeah we can't do that but what about in your in your olden days pre-diabetic as much pulp as you could put in it couldn't agree more I love I don't like la Juice without pulp at all never have it's disgusting it tastes vile I'd rather drink act actual lemon juice [ __ ] the when you burp up throw up a little bit that's what orange juice tastes like without pulp and with pulp it tastes like [ __ ] Heaven you're on an island with like with like so you go to the store and you get the Tropicana with lots of Pulp that's the only kind of orange juice I will drink uh I just think about The Sopranos thing where he comes out and he's like he's like the [ __ ] is this and K's like you like the orange juice with my God she [ __ ] throws it at its head or something so good oh but fresh squee fresh squeezed orange juice can have nothing I don't care what's in that it could be pul no the greatest thing of all time it's one

there any last words do you think you guys are going to clean Villa this weekend yeah probably because they suck and they're stupid not because they suck and they're stupid because they're going to

great weather right now i love the weather right nows back sharons back between 50s 60s sunny just like nice fall weather enjoying that itll be cold soon that wont be as nice winters coming winters always coming winter may have came for my f team unfortunately winters the only thing that came i didnt come no well im still waiting for the game to update cuz my seeno 10 is and my dibling zero is somethings going on there i have a seu 10 of my own right here my you dont have any zeros to auto sub i have a zero it just hasnt registered yet theyll fix that ill have to write a letter 33 points for team milan patrick ying do you remember numbers via sports i know every number of every player like i have my current fpl id is ray lewis sha to thats just how i remember every number im just like two you gotta put someone on there well whos number two in sports i dont know singled digit numbers like across all sports or like whos a famous number two because i dont i only know sports where the numers very prominent like i dont know baseball numbers that much because you just see the players face you dont know the first name that comes to mind for me is lj larry johnson easy two okay probably the best two of all time i think he switched later to like 24 but when he was on our team he was number two love that dont love my score another huge red arrow i just one return rogers only return except for seeno third on my bonus point palmer bath and aumo clean were my other returns so the other players were two one two lot of tw pretty bad its just like how the am i how can you pick 14 out of 15 idiot who cant get a single goddamn return like it seems when you think about it harder to pick 11 starters who get one or fewer returns its definitely it is to pick 11 started to get more than that if you just gave yourself the a pool of pick 11 players from these 45 players insane it would be difficult to get a grouping of them where you get one or less returns one or less its its insane cannot rest rico rico doesnt it doesnt matter if he played he gets two points anyway they suck but palmer we both captain palmer hes flagged now because lassandro red carded him but didnt get a red card everythings a disaster leandro is problematic hes hes a pig i hate that fu hes real hes hes a real high level scummer the two like dirty arguably dirtiest players in the league romero and leandro both had their red card moments this week romero managed to injure himself which made it feel a little bit better love to see that because its just like our ball dont lie moment its like you deserve to be injured nether got a red card leandros something i feel like romeros been a little bit better got there i think he hasnt thrown as many leg breakers as he used to under the previous regimes but leandro martinez is just a is a disgusting person but so is my team all right but your teams a little bit better because my team is the same as your team i just had salanki so i got 45 pulling up trees in a week where most people struggled to hit four i was a few points above the average but i was in all sorts go at like i was putting in minus i was putting in minus 16s and you were done sunday happened and i get the points and and rogers got points and i was like okay maybe i wont take a minus 16 this week i still might i still might do something to feel something but it just feels like its im feel like im walking in quicksand and im just not moving and nothings nothings fun and its just a real slog and drudgery we both save i got a massive red arrow you got a gray arrow but it does feel like what the are we doing like no i went down dont dont twist it you went down 20k i feel like that is a gray at this stage my fpl page is showing a red circle with a white chevron on its a red nice chevron name drop but no big deal well neither of us went for mo neither of us did the like aggressive like holland a mo move which a lot of people did hes hes the same ownership in our mug league as holland right now and all everyone who owned him capped him as they should he was easily the best cap and he came through barely barely but came through he had a oneonone and the world e but well thats not like holland didnt miss any chances hell we captain palmer anyway so palm jokes on us but his friends miss chances to deny assist thats what we were up thats why got a bath though hey we take a bath hey we take a bath more points in holland get huge let me update the leagues november mug leaders according to ff game we because the games not updated yet evert van balon and eddie tied of first cam anderson and ross logan tied for second bent schen bower in third place good j by all of you theres a another short month because theres an international break soon so maybe a good mug month and then ski card leading the public league same as last week whats up where do where to begin i feel like theres a lot of talking points today i need i have some selfish talking points that i want to go over with you but mean i think the first thing is probably just talking about defense is seems important right now because its brutal a lot of us are sitting here with a lot of money in defense and it seems stupid i know josh b said seriously are trent and gab worth it and barck my entire defense has four returns in five game weeks since i wild card it feels low even most defens is struggling asses from arsenal liverpool chelsea wheres the line between my picks are bad and i should change them and my picks are in a down period and will come good and thats the big question right is like do we start using free transfers in a place where we didnt think we were gna have to and didnt never wanted to use freeze right im pretty out on trent like hes just not attacking enough to warrant the price tag honestly to me hes just not right hes playing so much traditional right back hes not overlapping hes not getting in the final third more than a couple times a game in threatening positions and hes seven and its like was looking at him with glass half full for a while and giving him the benefit of the doubt but i think we have a large enough sample size under slot to look at him as being just hes just a right back he doesnt do the same things that were used to seeing him do under klo and at seven its just an insane outlay i get that hes good on bonus because he takes corners and creates chances but its just not wor i just cant he has one assist its game of 10 he started every game its like thats just not and it feels like thats about right like maybe thats a joke listen our old pod okay so there were a couple in game weeks one two three six seven game weeks it was another two big chances that werent scored but thats that wasnt scored s a center back but its thats the noise associated with assist where its like i know but he shouldnt be on one he should probably be on like four or five well i think that would be if he was coming in with every single chance he created was having a having a return but say he had three say he had two more assists okay he has six more points that would be six more points than he has right now but i still just dont feel like he getting enough opportunities and enough reps because in years past he would have it because he would have had the ones that hes missing and then more right hes just the volume isnt there i feel like what do you are you seeing it similarly or you still him all im just hes doing like heres the guys who are around him in fbr refs xa its mat three assists mcneil three assist saka seven assist savio two assist bumo somehow zero t almost t with trent foden one and palmer five like those are like thats the cluster of the highest in the league and its like you should probably be on three even if you just look at like the xg of the chances created two and a half three and like two to three is fair a lot of guys are on seven and theyre just over overperforming right like saka and but they also sometimes get the rebound assist and the fpl assist that trents not get im just real assist but i dont know you think itll just come good well for me the main thing is whether you believe in the clean or not which i do like brightons tough arsenals tough chelseas tough those are the last three they didnt keep it clean in any they still have city and newcastle coming soon home villa southampton at everton good run after the newcastle game those are all very cleanable and if the cleans come and hes still creating big chances every game and in the easier games i think hell get a lot more space too like in villa where they dont press the backline at all then its not just an assist thats plus three points and its an assist thats plus six points because if they keep it clean and he gets an assist hes going to get max bones and so possibly for me im just pretty comfortable chilling but i think that like probably for you and probably for a lot of people listening its not its not as simple as being like do i believe in trent or not its more like do i want to take the money out of trent to turn so and so into premium and thats where the conversation becomes a lot more difficult and a lot more team specific right its like if you can turn i dont know foden to saka next week like that is that worth taking a million youre like probably probably because i think trents going to have the most points of all the defenders at the end of the season provided he doesnt get injured and also i dont think its going to be worth 7m like i dont two different conversations right like but they all fact theyre all points of points on the column whatever sheet to figure theres other people who just have trent and palmer and wood and mo and what like theyre not considering getting rid of trent right because their just team is just good and they just get points every week because they have dom and wood and dj and already have mo in place what so i do think the team context matters a lot because like my team feels weird and bad because ive been doing badly youre you probably feel bad weird and bad about your team because youve been doing badly last few weeks and its like thats the obvious place to get the money then get the money it just also feels like there are no clean sheets are hot lava and i still believe that liverpool are the best defense and it just still feels a little bit silly to be putting seven here for i dont know just looking around therere all these four five its just like youre rolling dice and i have issues elsewhere in my team and freeing two and a half million here goes a lot further than just keeping trent like thats you have to make a decision right so like i think forest is a great example their underlyings are incredible theyre just a good team nunos this is a perfect nuno team doing a perfect nuno job right they have two cleans in the last three the red card helped but do you believe that nfo are going to keep cleaning at or better than liverpool like i dont they played home palace at lester home west ham and liverpool played home chelsea at arsenal home brighton so its like i just dont know if we should be overreacting to like three hard games where they didnt keep it clean and then they have three pretty tough games in the next four so these are the things where theyre not theyve conceded four goals in the last three games which is not a lot of goals and they have no cleans in those three games so its like youre looking at these things of well we need them to still get the random clean in the game we for to be hit theice that and it hasnt happened so far and no i think you can youre were not looking at this from a pace for pace of our nfo going to be keeping li but for 2 and a half million they dont need to keep pace they need they can lag behind a little bit and youre still in okay shape or that thing and its hard its like we were just talking about assists i think like the other noisiest thing in fpl is the one dumbass mistake or one dumbass deflection your team youre holding flecken as is on a 19p pointer and then harry wilson accidentally chips him with like his back heel on a volley and youre just whatever thats thats cleans baby yep but i think that is like a big talking point right now because mainly because of teams like nfo brighton fulham are okay these teams were i think have been playing better theyve been playing better but play once a week also yep also that but like just raw nonpenalty xg against nfls second best in the league right now bypo which tracks watching them play thats what it looks like it looks like new it is like vintage nuno wolves like that year where they were great and they finished seven backto back years and jim had 25 returns every year and they scored at most two goals a game and they conceded at most one goal a game and that was just every game all year and they look like a better version of that team because they have more pace on the wings and they have higher quality of players and they hit on the counter a bit better so theyre not going to fish in the top four but they i think some they could finish seventh there are a lot of bad teams this year its like if youre wildcarding right now its hard to imagine a world where youre not at least doubling nfo defense right like youre definitely going like sells ana right like that or cells m or sh sure and you rotate the defender and you have the keber sure so were were hyperfocusing on trent just cuz hes 7m and we both have him i think and ive been thinking about getting rid of him all weekend but gardial is also just very difficult to make a to get a handle on because this isnt also a team thats just theyre cleaning at the same rate as like lester and he just seems to score a goal every other game which is what hes been doing over the past five or six out of seemingly nowhere he just pops up on the back post and just saves his ass in get pointer biggest worldy of all of them like forget about scoring from outside the box that header was insane header and youve been and weve been talking about him as being just a certifiable donger its still just hes taking point like theres not a one in the 10th place of the xg chances hes getting and he just keeps scoring and i dont know its killing me dude its killing both of us its killing us in an immense way because he so highed my final decision on my wild card rico combination of players or gard and i went with rico who has what six eight 14 15 points since i wild carded and gards probably on like let me just check right now to kill myself 7 9 10 n 30 20 29 36 its just like thats that could not have gone more badly and it feels completely unsustainable and insane cuz theyve kept one clean in these fixtur like thats the other aspect of this where its theyve kept one clean in bournemouth southampton wolves fulham nuke like their defense is terrible and rico is an awful pick hes just an awful pick totally wrong on him and its a hold him though i he start but like i expect him to start most of the games going forward he hasnt started three games and were on gw 10 kyles back he doesnt do anything they dont keep cleans but kyle was the worst player on the pitch so thats a fact for what a factor for what for rinko getting minutes getting slapped by im just its just rico is just the most unreliable minutes play on a team that doesnt keep cleans who has three games a week until february im like what am i doing here like this is going to be pain and bad and its just going to be bad so i want even though even though hes cheap its almost like munchs hostage situation with him because i feel like i have to start him every week never gets me points like and i just find other things to do where im like if i just get rid of him as fast as soon as i can and put anybody else in i think im not going to not come ahead on that like i just i feel like i need to just god were both free from right now this is a this is a dark episode well its dark the only person i dont hate is honestly he h his little hand but he posts on his own personal instagram im fine and im starting midweek fine his fine hes doing hes doing fine reliable new only reliable injury news player in the league and then that doesnt even and i have i dont know if youve see this differently but i have no hope for city defense to just become more solid is there any case for that happening the case would be would have to be some guys get fit in the international break who r thats the case no not roder but like gundo it looks like hes running a is supposedly wasnt fit aan hasnt been training kyles not training like theyre all up like theyre at brighton this week like they should lose heavily they should just lose this game i expect them to lose the game i dont know what the to do with r man this is more postmortem but i might as well let cuz i wrote it down while i was getting ready for this pod you started on postmortem youve never even written postmortem i started on my notes i did the same thing last year i just paint copy paste stuff that i see or think about all right so i start the season with nico williams right gw one team because i y believe in for we both believe in piece of the wing back want a piece of the defense theyre going to be a good defense he keep he kept me one clean and then he got dropped i dont goko or nico williams no difference there handshake the thing that i wrote down thats interesting to think about maybe for future fbl seasons maybe itll come back get repacement i didnt get i still believed in the team but i went away from forest probably because partially because of like a away liverpool away brighton in four and five sure but look now and theyre cleaning every other week and randomly scoring goals like ana and like whatever and good god i could have just gone over to any one of them felt completely fine gotten a lot of points didnt do that just something for the future yep but long story short and we havent even mentioned arsenal defense ar so where are you at on arsenal rs casting god i dont want to make up and have nate yell at me as i did mad i still am sitting here and im like if i say something i get in trouble i still think theyre in the title race and a great team and i know it sounds absolutely insane after lost straw loss they need the international break badly odard supposedly back soon maybe hell be back for tell us hell definitely tell usll tell us gabrielles half knocked they dont have a left back theyre all up in a lot of ways he also doesnt use any of the depth which is a ett a personal problem but i dont know what to do i still believe in the team long term im sitting here with gabrielle every week im sitting here being like i want kai and saka maybe soon as the fixtures turn who are just like not kais just doing a defense stick with defense cuz i want to talk about arsenal more later but long story short i think still going to come through the numbers are still great gonna come good i think theyll come good i think the way they play and asnt as bad is as it is on the eye and theyre theyre one of the worst watches in the league y i think theyll keep cleans because thats all they play for what do you think are you also holding well i have rya so its its less painful with rya but i have been diddling around with taking him out for a million i what about in fantasy champions league do you ever make keeper transfers every week i have made a goalkeeper transfer every sing are you doing well in fantasy champions league a lot better than i am in fpl i just put it that way okay im just trying to draw parallels here im no im its not its not lost on me but no im broadly with you on arsenal i agree with you just the pessimistic way they play and the players are still fit its just the overarching impact that odard out has had on the team is just cannot possibly be understated enough what they look like without him and what they look like with him and it just touches every aspect of the team so its just the sooner he gets back the better ill feel about them but in the meantime they have been taking on water like very heavily right the newcastle performance was startling to me because they were awful they were awful and they let the goal up relatively early and then newcastle stopped playing and arsenal were happy to not keep playing so the thing right thats the thing with clean sheets is its so its so fickle its like thats the thing god tier cross and one sick header and its gone and they can see nothing else the rest of the game but i think thats i dont even know if thats good for them because i dont know either they didnt try and win so bad for them in the title but maybe still good for rya and gabrielle like i dont know i dont know but theyre hard to put a finger on terrible because theyre theyre also like their underlyings defensively and thats the same thing with liverpool like the underlying defensive stats have been good throughout these games where they havent been cleaning so its so painful because both of them are on this prolonged stretch of not doing it and we all have a lot of money tied up in that and and its going poorly but the other aspect too here though we have our last international break coming up but the pile up is coming and theys just going to be playing more games than ever so we then it gets back into the ageold question we have every year of is this good for the defense because they attack less and they just s stand around a lot more or is it just bad cuz theyre all blowing and theyre tired and most of the teams in the division arent playing twice a week and all the bad teams have better players and blah so im im im still keeping half an eye on that and just thinking like how are they be usually in the pileup the better teams the gap is wider usually because theyre used to playing three games a week the other teams the bad teams are not and they and they usually control the games or the bad teams dont right so i feel like thats a little bit of an advantage but sure i see that but like i feel like im in a insane stylum where like every live stream robot team that we talk to on friday has like poro leaf davis and cardiio and im sitting here with like well i have trent and gab who are way better than all those guys so im going to do good and then they 20 points and my guys get two points every week so somehow i dont know f i dont know i dont know mentioned there but hes not contributing hes just in every team thats why im like bad and then they get points well hes just as bad as trent and hes a million and a half less so jokes on us should go to b the other aspect to the defense and all this thats bizar is like the midfield is just suddenly like such a baron wasteland where theres the four premiums and then bumo and then nothing and then sub six million picks youre leaving out foden and bruno tactically i am not wellow i dont know if that was tactically but theyre there but i dont know foden has killed mes killing you fod hes got the most point dodge of any player in the league in this stretch only exclusively blanks except for his sub on and get a random assist on a corner against wolves blank every other game and he all hes doing is creating big chances and taking good shots that are like a whisker wide he is absolutely murdering me bruno got a pen 10pointer again all the robot teams etc kill me i dont know what the pens are good but i just make that point to say like we have all this money tied up in these premium defenders and typically the make a mill and a half here gets us to the midpriced midfield bracket and theres you think people would go like e to some amazing picks five and there just isnt one so its also like almost like you have to either gut your defense to get one of the premiums you dont have right or you just have your dick in your hands and you finger cross while your dicks in your hand and say i hope this comes good or you finger your when your dicks in your hands and just hold your bad pics and keep your now were cooking now were now were feeling something cu dude because like you said its like we were talking about trent as if that enables you singlehandedly trent to canate or trent to 47 ana or some but that doesnt do that takes you from five six midfielder to booma who you already own who doesnt play who doesnt even start or diaz who doesnt start whos on the worst team in the league shoots once every three games so you need five million or six million to go up to saka no like that doesnt even get you mo its all everythings everythings so another thing i wanted to touch on was just like who are we all going to want and if i feel like this is a who are we going to want in a few weeks moment because im having a hard time looking at the landscape and thinking about okay arsenal are in a bad moment liverpool are doing the things city like villa spurs like who are we going to want in a few weeks like how can we get ahead of the curve and i dont know what the an is but i wanted to throw that at you to see if you i also dont know what the answer is im looking at fixture ticker in front of me right now listen were going to talk about ally because you own olli and its been not that fun for you but after liverpool hes home palace at chelsea home brenham home southampton wish i had him for those thats thats a name to add to the list and s menu we both already own thats good job by us boo we own good job by us brighton are about to go on an insane run they will probably take points off of city and then they have a good run have a long good run after arsenal its hard to pull picks off of brighton though thats true does seem like no ones that nailed but wels ive been shouting wbs for week weeks k he just wasnt playing defense this game he played right wing against got like two good prettyy good chances and scored one of them where are you at with ch like do you think endod is someone whos going to be important or i just think hes fantastic i think you could do a lot worse than like 12 through 22 theyre lester villa southampton spurs brenham everton fulham ipswitch palace bournemouth wolves i think we want more than just palmer and hes like hes better than brennan johnson but in a brennan johnson way no i know but im saying in a brennan johnson way he just gets like minimum one big chance every game what about isok esok big fan playing well you were you were all about him where are you with bruno seriously hes eight2 hes been putting up good leg lester ipswitch everton coming up new guys coming in who speaks portuguese from portugal i dont know if this but brunos portuguese i know that hes hes a pick as evidenced by hland taking a bad touch and bob sanchez doing something dumb ending in bruno getting a free 10pointer that guys the pick right like if he doesnt even have to do anything but someone make a dumb mistake after a bad touch and he gets 10 free points thats pretty good my whole team didnt get 10 points but he also hadnt gotten 10 free points all year before that he had 23 points in nine game weeks so hes averaging he was averaging like not even three points a game so but hes been putting up big numbers very consistently i do think that like we both have knowledge at some points during the season like wof got away with that one again like there were those striker games where he was just like hitting the post but putting up big numbers he will continue to be the best player on the team old manager new manager interim manager doesnt matter hes a steady hold thats for sure i think the question is better suited to be like how do you compare him to any of the five premiums because im including foden in the mix and its just what team its a big two mil its a big two mil difference it is so i dont know if thats a fair comparison and the only reason im comparing is because of what you said earlier right like a remove bumo from the situation i think hes 97 owned in the mug right so we all have him so youre going from someone probably pretty cheap and youre going to want to turn that into bruno maybe but if youre if youre getting like three million youre already making multiple transfers right like youre either like getting out holland or doing trend and gab down like that so thats the reason why im comparing them to a premium because its like okay well should you just find another 2m and get saka or is it worth it to like keep one of the aention guys and get bruno up im trying to speak to like macro terms and talk about every team but long story short good hold hell get pens and random points and hes fine and good right feel like its he makes up the middle class with bumo okay so lets go over to villa cuz its like whats the wild card team right now like what do you mean like if youre wild carding right now and youre just like i want the best team like do you think bruno makes that team i dont know does holland even make that team i think i still am standing on holland like i think that its gonna hes going to be fine and its going to be okay this sitters every week is good you mean its i think its okay to us like we are doing the edge thing that we wanted to do which was point case in point not captain him like at bournemouth where he blanked and we just didnt hit so like that is to me the way forward but im not willing to compromise by not having holland and i like jamming mo im like i dont think mos better like he gets worse chances every game than holland and we talk about five points to four points for the goal blah but no its just thats not the thing to me but i think its holland wood some anybody else and then you have i think palmers in there saka may its either saka or bruno like bumo seeno and then defenses pick your poison like how much i think thats the biggest question is how much do you want to spend in defense because you could skimp on defense and you can have holland palmer mo easily thats easy you easily make that team with wood and another budget forward tr larson i think thats team off top my head no i think he just has that team off the top of my head and that it all comes back to defense in a weird way mo whos well on his way to another 200 point season the usual will he slow down in the second half he usually does they dont press as much as under clop so maybe he wont but hes hes phenomenal hes just unbelievable so where do you where do you see saka in all of this like just looking cuz when im looking at my team like thats a pretty big question is if like i could easily get saka like it would make me maybe i would have to sacrifice a little bit of a from getting a midprice player to a budget play but like getting like him versus bruno for example where maybe i could have a bit a little a little bit better of a like a spreading the money a bit better but like is saka just hes going to be in every team by game week like 14 because theyre going to doing all the things again and hes just going to be it or is he someone that you can also wait and see or like how priority byy is he knowing that youre in the byow phase sir hes still pretty high for me i feel like a broken record right its like all these picks that were good three weeks ago im sitting here being like no hes still a good pick and everyone else whos soaring past me in the overall rank doesnt have any of them right im like hollands still good and saka is still good and trent and gab and whatever but what i think i think saka is still a great pick i would not buy him this week aru dont buy him in 12 either international break nfo is good that could just be a nothing weird game then it starts west ham man united fulham everton palace ips brenford brighton like i just think odard will definitely be back by then other guys who probably wont go on international because theyre all dinged up right now thatll be good for them and i think theyll just start winning game so i think palmers still better and palmer has that long good run and thats why we both have him and then i think saka is the probably next premium that you want long term sure okay what do you think i dont im im a little bit more scatter brand about him honestly than you are just because its he we look at him and talk about the avenues that he has and and its just like hes still not he just like trickles in these points that are just like he doesnt shoot that much no i know but like he doesnt shoot that much he just gets fouled 10 times a game plays out wide he doesnt come inside a lot like its still a lot of the stuff from last year which i know i probably sound like im in denial but he has three goals this year like its like not that good and i dont think he should have more like so look he finishes up the season with nine which would be like his lowest total ever and that would be assuming they dont get a few free pens they need some pens he needs seven assists but thats also is just like how many assists is he going to get on like corner kicks like i dont know break the record maybe but i dont know i just think hes so great and they build around him hes the best player on the team hes one of the best players in the country and the team the team what is it what is the thing people say rising tide whatever the fck ship that for him arsenal get better pictures get easier i think hell get better like odard will let him come inside more control in the final third will let him take more shots cu its to me it is like i dont think sun is at the races right now like i dont think he should be i know they have the i switch game but switch game their fixtures are a little bit mixed coming up i know he usually scores against city and theyre not a good team but at 10m with him playing wider than ive ever seen him play before a winger like the ca the only like its hard to even make a case for son of brenan at this point to me if they do the same thing except brennan gets big chances and sun doesnt cuz pass and sun can no im with you on that so it does i think it does narrow down to saka versus bruno honestly of like if youre going to get another expensive midfielder assuming youre not getting rid of holland to fun mo and you have palmer like that is the question isnt it so its sala on the way expensive end where you have to sacrifice something else saka in the middle there whos just great and then bruno if you dont want to sacrifice someone like if you want to keep salanki or ali or like someone else in that range and have like two upper guys for me for me it would be like i could do like if i could if i wanted to get bruno then i could get someone like eso but if i wanted to get saka i would have to get someone in the wood range m i see what you mean so thats like the difference i think saka is way better than bruno if thats the question i think the pens cancel each other out im not going to try and predict who gets more pens but arsenal are way better and are going to score way more goals i think that like like my overarching take is arsenal just had three hard fixtures liverpool just had three hard fixtures them and city are still the three best teams in the league i think theyll come good long term but it feels stinky and bad right now thats 100 for sure because the the other thing i wonder too is its like bruno plays ler ep switch and everton the next three and it gets bad after that they play arsenal nfl and city and we know how invisible he is in big games theres no more bankable blank than him in a big game so like then im almost also they have a new manager like we dont even know what the which to me with that middle they cant be worse than theyve been either yes its an unknown but is it throw him for a few and they have these good fixtures but whenever ive been doing that instead of like i wanted eso before and they had tough fixtures and all he does is score so im like whenever ive been doing that instead of just get the player that i prefer or then it just doesnt go as well for me i feel like its thats thats where my regret for the mo thing comes in because all ive been saying all season is like i just want to flip around the premiums for fixtures and so far that also hasnt worked for me mos got 10 against arsenal and 12 against chelsea its like well right so first of all getting rid of him he gets 12 and 10 but then also i didnt get him back for home brighton when i know hes the best captain thats like exactly what i said we should be doing and he gets nine id still be on a red probably but it be not 300k it be 30k so the big difference and then vill i need more im so biased with watkins its out of control but buas which way i good or bad i dont know i dont know it depends on if he got points this weekend but where like what do you like do you see villa as different this year than last year the year before like what do you whats going on with you and olli like you you i think ive seen almost every villa game which is my theyre always oness they play sunday not always sunday but a lot a lot and they deserve it they finished fourth last year and theyre a good team they just got dismantled by spurs but i think anyone who watched that game realizes that was like an even game until the very end meltdown moment there was nothing happening villa were isue for me with them its a big part of the issue but its also what i expected i feel like when the thing that i expect happens i feel more comfortable with the assets if that makes sense like i expected them to just be annoying and all mcin does is put his ass in everybodys face and he goes down for he is jordan iou hes thats all he is hes white scottish jordan iou yes with a bigger ass and he just tries all he does is back that ass up and try and draw fouls his whole thats the whole thing was time waste and draw fouls and give the ball to jacob ramsey and let him try and like beat three people on the dribble that was the entire game surprised he doesnt do it didnt work i thought rogers played well oly had a couple chances but its just theyre not an elite team so when you h they have fixtures where theyre unfavored it usually doesnt go well owning their assets and thats the problem with at liverpool this week at chelsea and 13 you dont expect them to score like more than one on the other end when they open things up and attack and let the guys run around they have been scoring pretty good goals and duran might score duran scores rogers is he going to score his big chance or not or is he going to assist the chance so i look at them and i see home again i mentioned this earlier home palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home southampton 15 i want rogers and oi in all of those i want to start them both in all of those games but you also have to look at them for at liverpool and at chelsea which is like it should balance out to put a lot of stress on these games where if they dont return youre but largely theyve been good and the good games and they and then they have nfo city newcastle its like well its easier with rogers cuz hes so cheap you just rotate him in out it doesnt matter hes returned in every single game youve expected him to return his returns are lester everton woles i switch fulham and he bl bled well okay first game games of the season he was carrying a knock and getting subbed early every game so he blanked western blanked arsenal fine blanked man united cuz no one played that game blank bournemouth blank spurs like hes good man like i dont know what to say it just you have to hold your nose when they have they have a bad fixure because its going to be ugly but he still got a couple chances he easily could have scored in that game and then like i feel like if he scored in that game we wouldnt even be talking about it we would just be like hes just great ass that he just hold he just keeps getting like hes on like life support all the time i feel like though the main thing that gets me with them is they just dont attack they dont attack and he doesnt have the free like bruno right man utd they dont attack they try and counter but they attack theyre just bad theyre bad but they send six guys forward all the ially theyll throw the guys forward but like ali doesnt have the free goals in his back lock like in the back pocket which we dont think he might well i it would just stun me if he took the ne they might but thats the other thing is they dont get pens no they dont get pens they dont attack like no ones in the box ever so how could they win a pen also just way less pens this year it feels like way less pens this year but just like im with you on the he gets a couple good chances of game and he will because hes that good of a player and i dont know if thats enough this year like looking you compare him to bruno who we keep bringing up again right he just cant keep up with them right like but even comparing him to like esok like how is he better than esok hes just not like theyre playing too many games i dont think he is i dont think he subs and changes they dont attack they play all these games theres squads he subs duran on at 60 and then when they play together its like i dont know whats going on and the they just they dont attack they just dont attack and so like you i just feel like there i every time i look at watkins im just like again it feels like hostage taking its if i had him id be feeling exactly the you got rid you ripped the bandaid off a few weeks ago part of wild card right isnt that when i got rid of him i dont know why you got rid of him but you did a good thing i think whenever i got of it was part of a wild card part of like a triple move or some but i would better than wood hes not better than wood they attack but no ones better than wood they attack similar amount of times and he doesnt even have pens and hes three million more its like probably not he might have pens like how many forwards are better than watkins its many forwards like its not two or three its probably like seven for the price of course of course to factor the price in i think thats right i think thats right and yet id be sitting here as you are sitting here agonizing over home palace home brenford home southampton and not having him in those pictures is pointer in there theres a 23p pointer quad return in there which hes done before and we do again and thats the brutal part of this game that feeling of if i do this the worst possible thing is going to happen to me which is this guy getting a haul is like fpl in a goddamn nut chell i dont know how to get around that feeling and i dont know if that feeling is just us getting hurt a couple times and thats all we remember because usually that probably doesnt happen right no it doesnt happen and then our sins get washed away and then we move on to the next shiny it could not happen 10 times in a row and then the 11th time you get rid of fod he has hatrick and im like of course he has a hattrick god damn it i just got rid of him so lets we havent we havent mentioned the we havent talked about anything well were were just talking were just talking in circles i dont know what the no were not talking in circles were talking about stuff but lets lets talk about wood because we havent mentioned hes 65 now scored again hes the best pi in the game hes the best striker in the league and the best pick in the game so their fixtures coming up home newcastle at what their fixtures are soad so home newcastle at rcast home ipswitch at city at united home villa at brenham home spurs at everton at wolves were were in 2025 its all happening not getting them it im too depressed to get this guy now whats the opposite of sun cost ive sun my depression and im not going to solve it by getting the best player in the league so what am i doing if im if i believe everything i said earlier about gabrielle and newcastle have been playing better and ricos fine im not gonna panic then why the would i get chris wood well one thing about chriswood thats an interesting one is like we might have just been sarily mis assessing and mis categorizing him from the beginning because hes been with nuno for two years and hes just been the best striker not named holland in the league since hes the best striker including holland holland fine whatever but so i we take it that we take it that we look at their opening 10 and its been a lot of bottom half teams in there they played liverpool they played chelsea other than that you might sneak an eighth or a ninth place team were looking at bottom 10 teams and scored against chelsea anyway sure scored against chelsea and look fixtures breed form blah that just means that theyre about to play tougher fixtures coming up which i just read the run out to 2025 and its certainly more difficult than the first 10 games of the season yes but like hes 65 theyre playing in a way that maximizes his strength we make fun of how old he is but hes not that old he doesnt have a ton of tread on his tires you he misses a few games every year and hes hes hes just played a handful of years so its not like this is a player thats like broke in when he was 17 and hes been playing top flight football with 3000 minutes like hes going to fall off a cliff and he doesnt he cant run anyway the pace is in his game he shifts his movements good and headers like finding the poachers goals they get good theyre good setpiece team like are the bad fixtures enough to just say we missed the points and hes its going to dry up or is this just us finding more reasons to shoot ourselves in the foot thats what it feels like its that me saying even me saying im not getting him made you laugh like why does that lets analyze that why is that funny its funny because its so stupid because hes better than holland hes better than salan hes better than everyone and we dont own him because and hes cheap but why like why wouldnt we both get him now we should we should be part of our transfers to should just be to get them we should get him in this week we should get him in every week every week that passes get him in once this week next week whenever doesnt matter i dont know what to say dude okay aral at city youre start everyones just going to start him like i dont know thats when you rotate in rogers is rogers is home palace home brenford and those two is that the five is that the five head where we should have him with the rogers rotation for these couple because rogers has the good ones that oli has that i just named right home palace and 12 home brenford and 14 home southampton and 15 and would in those same weeks say at arsenal at city at man united right thats just free right thats free real estate allegedly its just like so stupid should have him makes me want to die even thinking about that like you getting dom it worked out this week and me getting darwin that same week that we both made our forward transfers and both had more money in the bank than we deserve and we both so should have gotten wood that it was even on the pod i was banging your head with a shovel being like no its woods the best pick get wood blah fast forward to friday were both getting in d and dar when you dont even like dom and i hate him you hate dom and spurs and were like dom and just like so much regret so much pain its just the worst dude this is the worst of it i dont know what to do three freeze team sucks holland sucks foden sucks i dont know to do dude wood its its still back to just like the fixtures for me i just look at the fixture im like insane theyre not good so do i know you talking about so and so team doesnt attack right we were just talking about villa and blah who doesnt attack no goddamn team but like then but also if you look at the fixtures and you take away at arsenal at city theyre pretty good so newcastles fine its not great at home theyll score theyre not getting blanked in that game theyll score home is phenomenal atman uniteds probably fine although like nfo would this is here i am making more excuses like an absolute but im going to do it anyway my goddamn pod but like would and nfo should in theory be the type of team that doesnt like a goddamn pile up right like playing every three days for this fcking small squad like how much can a longa and cho and ana and moreno and would run in a week like lets put that to the test i dont know dude i feel like a complete idiot and im lost at se right now would so i dont know what to do i should just bow down to the robot itll tell me to just get wood and e thats probably the recommended m get an injured e get as a wood and bruno thats what itll say to me if i punch in my team right now im sure but so you going to get wood or what i dont know its the players i want to remove the most are watkins dipod and trent and i was going to bring up dibling because the theory of rotating in rogers works well if you have an eighth att if rogers your eighth attacker but for me i have archer and you have dibling so it doesnt work one of them plays and one of them doesnt but like i dont i dont want to start archer anymore than i h already have right and thats where like want to looking at the next month or two i want to move rogers to be my eighth attacker i dont want to rely on him on a week on we basis and so thats something that im putting a high emphasis and value on of getting rid of dibling because hes not he isnt isnt he is the false hope hes not what i was hoping he would become and im ready to cash in there so i can afford everything i can punch in those three spots is phenomenal but i just dont know which combination of phenoms i want luckily theyre all phenomenal though cu then that means feel it feels like i cant go wrong with the replacements combination of phen so goddamn good it feels like i cant go wrong but i know im gonna pick the wrong ones and go its gonna go wrong if i had to describe a f to someone whos never heard of the game i would say its a game you just cant go wrong you just get just get good guys and nothing bad ever happens you cant go wrong until you just want to die well thats where i am theres a lot of questions here but i just dont want to read them okay so i think well just push them to thursday maybe okay except for these two lifestyle questions we could do those before we do that so you dont have too strong vibes about anything youre just a mess im definitely a mess but i think everyone should get wood and i think saka is better than bruno those are the questions you as me right what i can ill just do that like i can just do that take a hit get them in saka is at chelsea this week im very happy if you waited a week for it maybe but but if i wait a like me waiting a week means that i start walkins at liverpool like give me saka i dont like that like its so the waiting is less advantage but the other thing i can which might just be also a thing i could do is just get bruno now inste of saka and wait on saka and brunos just placehold until i feel like making that switch im very fine with that too at chelsea is bad home nfls bad like bad every week so far this season the big teams have struggled after the international break i could be wrong someones going to comment spurs beat well theyre not a bigley 8 n whatever the i dont care but im pretty sure thats how its gone is like after the international break liverpool lost one nil to forest man city barely beat brenford arsenal barely beat spurs chelsea got dominated by bourou that was the first international break next international break let me see arsenal lost two nil to bournemouth city barely beat wolves liverpool barely beat chelsea and now were here and the next international break its probably more of the same theres no reason for me to believe it wont be they come back slow all their best players are away 8000 miles away in south america whatever wait on them f im fine with you waiting on saka bruno wood i could also just get not hit keep trent get bruno and strand larson you cant do bruno and wood no i cant afford it and then get get wood for salanki after ip switch coia by the way we talked about coa on the live stream everyones going coa everyone in discord absolutely wanking to him getting an assist in one bones me and you sitting here saying id rather have the striker guess what he got a goal and two bones not one bone i dont know but thats thats another thing thats interesting to like i like str larson just being so slept on because everyone world has k you cuz strand larson is also like lowkey a younger version of wood hes good hes been good ive all season ive been saying damn he looks great like im psy he poaches and hes good work grade and hes so i might i could do that i could do that not hit i like him a lot not hit not hit do that but what do you think about solani just long term like is this did this triple return he like hes just definitely keep him through the tough fixtures and or is it like hes still too expensive compared to the wood and the the triple return was like everything i feel like i was saying last week about spurs is like all they are is inconsistent and thats fine because every team outside of liverpool city and arsenal i expect to be inconsistent and southampton theyre very consistent too consistently but we got it we got it spurs like that game was on such a knifes edge like i implore people who just watched highlights and are like my god spurs were amazing to go back and watch that game cuz villa could have won that game 41 also like oi big chance goes in rogers had another chance that goes in like that game could have fallen apart because of the way they play they play if so and so makes the one big challenge and we like davies wins that huge tackle that immediately led to a goal like two seconds later spurs were scoring a tap in and thats just how they play and other times the center back misses the challenge or whatever and then the other in un clean in clean 2v1 3v one and thats just how they are so theyre going to have these games like the palace game especially thats the worst ive seen them play in the a year where they just all their buildup doesnt work and everythings broken up and the press isnt working theyre just terrible but theyre just going to have these games whether its villa west ham whoever where they just blow the doors down and it feels silly to me not owning at least one of their attackers like what even if its not dom its bj whatever because you want a piece of the four ones and i think the four ones will keep happening as will the losing three nils that also happen thats fair i could hold dom and bench him bench him in the city game sure could do brennan johnson is just an alltime hilarious player i cant get over this guy its hard to cuz watching that game too is hes just not playing like he just wasnt playing he doesnt ever play didnt do anything just over there i dont know what the hes do i dont know what hes doing what hes involved what hes where hes running like what his role is or what hes supposed to be doing and then he just pops up hes just like hey im here i did a goal hes like okay by im done thats whats up you i did a go he and then he vacates the premises again and he just and he had one shot and it was a tap in thats it hes ad him done hes three true outcomes hes either going to d walk strike out all right thats who he is its great but so salan its good pick and pj good pick salanki could be a could be a longer salanki could be a longer term and a little bip and bop i kept saying to people not just you is like i know his last two games or whatever it was three games in a row he had three bad games in a row but like the reason his season stats were still so good is because the two games before that were absolutely monster insane games that balances out to good pick right so like hes gna have these games where he didnt get a shot this didnt work the press didnt work whatever and then hes going to have games like this where five minutes he feels like he got a triple rout well i think the other interesting thing too just to note on him is he did just get there so he just got there and he was injured for a game one and an just cant stop wanking to how much salan does for the team with his link up play and just all his movement and blah all that stuff so you do also expect just maybe the teammates learn how to find him better cuz its its it is very interesting watching like him play is like they just never find him and its we know his movements good weve been seeing his movement be good for thousands of minutes so hes mov on bournemouth and its like theyre just hes playing with better players for the first time in his life since he was a child on liverpool and he played like 20 minutes for them so youd expect that should get better with time and that could happen too which is and he has that thing that we always used to complain about with kane where he would like kane would drop deep build and then not have the athleticism to make it in the box but he gets to the box thats how he gets that got the goals right like he comes deep he does a little wall pass whatever gets to the box and then its like either him or bj are gonna get this tap in hes not that slow so i dont know i think hes a longterm good pick but all right so we move a lot of these things to next to thursday maybe ill sit tight with them all right so what do we got for lifestyle we had a couple ones lifestyle a couple questions fed said orange juice with or without pulp asking a couple diabetics about a sugar water we cant do that but what about in your in your olden days prediabetic as much pulp as you could put in it couldnt agree more i love i dont like la juice without pulp at all never have its disgusting it tastes vile id rather drink act actual lemon juice the when you burp up throw up a little bit thats what orange juice tastes like without pulp and with pulp it tastes like heaven youre on an island with like with like so you go to the store and you get the tropicana with lots of pulp thats the only orange juice i will drink i just think about the sopranos thing where he comes out and hes like hes like the is this and ks like you like the orange juice with my god she throws it at its head so good but fresh squee fresh squeezed orange juice can have nothing i dont care whats in that it could be pul no the greatest thing of all time its one of the ne of the gods were talking about store bot were talking but i just want to clarify that doesnt cross pollinate with that fresh squeeze is a different beverage entirely fing and this is just for you said who are you sticking the armband on tomorrow fantasy champions league fuckle i dont know i havent made my moves yet i was i was looking at garasi the dort dortman lad okay i was also looking at theyre playing sturm grates the stms grads wherever they from i dont know and then i was also looking at getting vinnie in i havent had vin vinnies milans been bad but i dont know i still feel like milans maybe not like that dog so i dont know who stm grates are so maybe i would go cheeky gassi has a lot of goals maybe go with him so hes going to have the fire under his ass not winning the balon door theyre seemingly very who do you like there for the cap dude i dont know between the two gasi or well i have to im gna bring someone in the cap so if i sounds good to me gassi i like everything ive heard about him looks good all right ill probably do that then okay should i do a goalkeeper transfer on money mic or should just let it right you have to keep it going keep it going okay you have to keep the good time i dont know whatever i dont know who to get though let me see here whos playing tomorrow i cant get too many dortman players thats just ridiculous theyre not that good no theyre not i already have chan who like didnt play last game which was a disaster that keller her easy no hes hes i cant get a cant go with que come on i know dont get an english player a pr player but all right well sorry for not answering questions to everyone but im having a bad time so thats not going to happen let me slap asses here new signups willie naylor dixon world piece steven kaplan david sher ass baby get in there any last words do you think you guys are going to clean villa this weekend probably because they suck and theyre stupid not because they suck and theyre stupid because theyre going to play the exact same way i think and theyre just going to time waste and try and draw fouls and just not attack much at all no game will break out yes so i think itll be a lot of that which is pretty good for a clean i think all right all right dude any last words all right bab see you tomorrow see you tomorrow check us out fieldcom fieldcom subscribe,12442
21,FPLBlackBox,sjX983THlNM,FPL BlackBox | Devil May Fly | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25 | Gameweek 11,2024-11-07T23:54:16Z,[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good evening everyone welcome to FBO blackbox ahead of gameweek 11 my name is asz and look at that Mark we are bang on time for the first time I don't know God knows BL is so surprised I look at pangy in there oh my God that's on time it's it's the new it's a new software we're using which is a lot Slicker means I'm a bit calmer I didn't throw any headphones this week I had to get a new webcam though because my webcam broke last night you so nearly did a whole week of like no stress and then last night it's as my webcam is broken I need to get an order on I don't if it's going to arrive in time it's so oh here we go it was it was so tranquil nothing straightforward It Anyway thecam minutes before 10 minutes before we start we're in we're on time beautiful green arrows as well come on go you've closed the Gap though haven't you massive week for you massive we'll talk about that in a bit what else are we going to talk about tonight we got we we got some stuff on Amar we talk about his new tactics what we can expect three amazing fixures for them uh coming up so we'll talk a bit about those I've already got one in my side I might be getting another one so we'll see see uh what what tonight brings uh on that we got to talk about big Dom big Dom sanki getting his 16o return making a lot of people very happy Near making me very sad cuz I do you know how close I was to selling him have I told you I know oh I can't believe it you were going to do what you were going to do Dom to Ry gimenez right yeah I was going to do Dom to gimenez and I had it on confirmed transfers and I did a poll uh I did a poll on Twitter which which said something like who scores more than X2 salanki or gimenez and I think it it was like 65% him Anders people said seriously yeah and uh I looked it and I thought there's lots I could do with that money I want to be moving to Palmer in the future you know salah's obviously a player that I want I can take some money out and and go for him and is I I would be sick to my stomach if I had done that move so glad I didn't I'd be I'd be I'd be beating you if you'd have done that you would be yeah my godar me imagine that I can't believe you were that close to doing it as well I I we did talk about it didn't we because we talked about salanki last week and you said you on the verge of giving up on him and I said I said we got to hold him for the h switch game surely and and aren't we glad we did because now he goes into that game as what I looked at the betting odds that Rob T put up and he's like the third favorite scorer this game week and yeah our teams look pretty good with salanki in there um so yeah commiserations to anyone who mov this week is he you going to cat on him right spoiler early spoiler know I know come from uh G from selling him to Captain it's a funny old game and if you look at the fixures he's had you know Brighton West Ham you know I switch to come the game that I didn't hold out much H for was this was this Villa game and it seemed like The Logical one to sell him on but you called it last time you said Villa have looked a bit a bit ropey um you know struggling a bit with with the Champions League uh you know the underlying stats in defense were good but starting to Tire a bit and I thought Spurs were were brilliant in that match and and rightfully blew them away so oh it should be a big I mean you've got three Spurs assets going into whips Swit I know I me it's funny isn't it because last week when I got porro and Johnson in it looked like I've made a fa Parkers obviously they went to Paris and they were miserable I didn't expect the returns I didn't expect big returns in the Paris game but I thought I might get something but it was always with the vi the home games in mind um the three home games that they got in four and but I wasn't expecting the big returns in the Villa game so it'd be just like it would be spursy wouldn't it if they like Drew one and yeah lip swis s got the goal or something yeah yeah surely not uh we have got over 400 joining us already and there's European football going on and Chelsea what they what six seven8 nil up by now I don't know they were 6 n up after 42 minutes against the uh Armenian minnows that they were playing six nil at halim yeah exactly no Cole Palmer in that game of course we will all touch on Cole palmer but just to give a shout out to those uh in the chat tonight thank you for joining us that's Paul signs that's Henn fbl Forest you sexy beast Nicholas kill Tristan Cox Tony G Mr Lucian emu show Connor Richardson I am 1974 at a boy FBO yellow Army good evening um Davis Family First Tony G J keeg they're all in tanky no sign of Nigel yet I'm sure he's there in the background just hasn't commented yet thank you for joining us uh on a Thursday night 9:00 we'll be going up to probably 11: knowing us maybe a little bit more if there's any super chats in there we will get to them of course of course let's get on with this by hitting your game week Mr as your first 53 points talk us through it God you're really getting into this like streamer hosting lck you reading reading names hitting my team I can't wait till the smash and like yeah actually I I'll do a bit of that in a minute off to go uh yeah t is all right week 53 points uh ryer and Trent the two premium Defenders who a lot of people have got obviously disappointing kind of each and every week uh with with three and two uh with the one Moreno finally actually making past the halfway line was was was was nice to see and Ana on the on the other side it's nice to see the fullbacks finally doing a bit of bit of attacking it was Moreno's best display from an attacking point of view obviously had an amazing display against Salah anfield but going forward uh last weekend he was just yeah very confident taking players on it was great to see it looks like he's like really enjoying being in the side isn't he like you see his celebrations after the games and he's like acting for the players and there obviously real quality like there and I think with Ana as well on the other side they're there's no reason why they should be Shackled because they can offer a lot going forward so I think Moreno at 44 um is is a good purchase I think if you offer me the the switch to to Ana I'd probably take it he's a little bit more but um I'm pretty happy with Mor how minkovich didn't score though oh no we'll talk about him later right he had one past the post and then the brilliant sa by fabianski for the one that Anderson play back to him I mean it's coming for him for sure yeah uh the the issue with my defense though was was I I bought in leaf Davis to play him uh in in in two games what you thinking here tell talk me through the logic of that you B you have leave Davis surely you have to play him in the home games yeah well the logic was I'm not I'm going to play Trent on I Trent's obviously going to play I'm G to play Moreno at home to West Ham so there was one spot and it was between LS Gabrielle and and Davis but did you really think that City would keep a clean sheet at Bournemouth I two clean sheets at all season I didn't think any three of them would and the the the the issue was I mean I just thought it was I just thought it was a loss it was probably which one has probably the best chance of the clean sheet in these three and I thought it' probably see but when you're talking about Leaf Davis it's got to be who's the best one for attacking returns is it if you didn't think take clean sheets out of it who's more likely to get you an attack in return Leaf Davis or or L okay if you if you if you if you can tell me that you were expecting Leaf Davis to score a left footed volley from the corner of theen area into into the into the corner I mean basically it happened what I mean they all concede it that's kind of what I thought would would happen and I think it was it's just a lottery isn't it I mean Lewis could have scored a goal if he'd started from from outside the penalty era Gabrielle could have headed one in from a set piece I don't know it was it was a mistake is top for chances created of all Defenders yeah but they haven't got any Strikers that can score yeah I'll give you that I don't know it was it was probably it was probably the wrong move I it was the wrong move give the points um and I I wish I had played him because I you know I I bought I literally had him for the these two games I had him for everon at home and Lester they were the two games I was going to play him in and I went went against that uh thing but so yeah that's nine points lost which which does hurt but anyway uh played Rogers though played Rogers yeah played Rogers I was I was happy with that with his with his nine uh foden I mean again I don't know how he blanked in in that match he's he's now the second highest for XG um involvement over over the last two game weeks just behind Harland who also planked again uh inuma garach I mean how did Garo not get a return against against Chelsea because he's very wasteful that's why yeah I know but oh my God he had two great chances in that game uh harand blanked I don't know how he blanked in that Watkins had a great one-onone opportunity against Spurs and put it wide and luckily I was bailed out by by sanki cuz without him with Salah scoring and kind of other things going on it wouldn't have been a very good week so yeah it was it was a funny week it was a week where I think it could have been better if i' played Davis foden got something gach got something yeah ifs woods and buts but Green Arrow Fen had that chance second half that he put wide it was a good shot that yeah and and he's you know he scored in midweek of course so it's coming for foden there's no doubt um it's just how long you hold him really against the options out he's got one more week one more week for me uh heroic doses says as if it makes you feel better I did play Davis but I bench salanki oh bench salanki I don't think that makes me feel better makes me feel a bit makes me feel a bit sick Mr or Mrs doses what did you have up front that meant you bench salanki I want to know we all want to know put that in chat I'll look out for it let's bring my team up Shelby because it's a green arrow it's a big one 75 do we have to fleen oh fleen we're talk we talk about him shall we I mean that was absolutely painful some some fbl gold between us though wasn't it because um when he when the clean sheet went in you said to me you know when when do you think he'll break your heart and it was inevitable I was like well it always what always happens is you wait until they got maximum bonus and that's when they concede you wait until they hit Peak points and he got maximum bonus and then he started getting more saves and he was on for 12 conceded one only fell to eight and I was like you know what I'll take the eight three bonus with the 10 say perfect and I thought to myself the only way he's going to lose the free bonus now is if he lets another one in and this is with what 30 seconds to go yeah and they played another minute of stoppage time and he let the second one in it was funny watching because because obiously you've got him I haven't and I went for Ray I'm paying more and it's been painful owning owning Ry over the last few and I was I kind of joked you I sent you the message and said oh how long till fleen loses it and as the game started going on I started getting more and more nervous that it wasn't going to happen and he was just going to go on and get this absolutely Mammoth Hall and I don't know when when when they scored it was funny cuz because you you'd said to me when's he going to [ __ ] the pet and then you were watching the stream but you're a little bit ahead of me and so then I just got the message from you saying yep he's absolutely sh and then literally as I read it I saw him concede and I was like oh oh believable yeah it was I I was kind of prepared for it so it wasn't as devastating as perhaps it would be for others and obviously I'd had a good game we so I could take it if I had a bad way game week I think I'd have had to say to pip uh i' just go out we need some more milk or something then just gone for a walk for two hours at like 10:00 at night you know just invented a reason to get out the house and be alone I mean there there must be people out there who you know if you didn't have slanking if you didn't have Salah um maybe even have Johnson bench I'm sure there's going to be people out there who had you know Rogers on the bench sorry not Johnson Rogers on the bench no salanki no Salah and had fleen and saw that Hall and saw the Green Arrow and was like thank God I got a player bringing something home and then yeah oh sorry if that's you dear me anyway fleen four Trent two Gabrielle 2 porro one miserable in defense Ino 3 and here it comes Rogers nine Johnson 8 Salo 18 seeno Chow was the captain of course seeno 10 Harland two salanki 16 obviously the fact that I played seeno over Lewis raised a few eyebrows and of course raised suspicions of oh we got a leak I I I knew people think that the thing is I was on the train to notam I had no signal and I was like try to get a signal to message in WhatsApp and say oh people are going to think this aren't they when when uh basically I just like all the team news was coming in and so on and I was like I was surprised that more people didn't play so many I was surprised how many teams did bench de bench him um yeah I was pretty shocked that I was he was such a differential because I always thought City would concede and then like who's most likely get the goal but what was funny one of the reasons I played him and this is I shouldn't be affected by this but I was on you know on Friday night I was waiting for the Embargo team news to come through and it came through from Pep about oh I've got a few injuries so that spooked me a bit and I thought well we don't know who those injuries are and he he said to like you'll find out or something I was like brilliant thank you very much so I I didn't think Lewis would be injured but I thought that perhaps there'd be more injuries and then City more likely to concede so I thought yeah I'll play some meno if they're going to be weakened but the other thing that made me play him was um there was a interview with him on BBC on the BBC website which I presume was on Football Focus and on it he talked about setting a goal Target and and you know when it's just recency biased I watched it and thought yeah actually he's a good player and he yeah he could get fit and I was I was talking myself into playing him and that's that was played into it as well and it's just weird out those little things like if you read an article or someone you know there someone just brings a player to mind you could be on Twitter could you just bre through Twitter and that could be the thing that just makes you go when it's so close and it was I mean like the difference between seeno Rogers Lewis when I looked and Gabrielle when I looked at review because I was looking at review and they were all about between 3 four 37 expected points but when it's like that it's like well you know it's down to me really there's not there's not enough in it where the algor the model going to help so yeah I just went on my biases which was well I don't trust pep and I think City will City will let one in at least and they let two in so two two things on that uh firstly you could have you know given me the tip off that Lewis was benched that would have been I didn't know he was Bench did I oh yeah yeah of course you didn't yeah yeah you think I'm that I'm glad City wasn't the first kickoff because it would have been even worse wouldn't it imagine if we both bench Lewis imagine if I had bench Lewis for uh for Davis would have got absolutely slated for for for being in the the the old cartel um I wanted to ask say say for example you had to play Lewis this week because obviously you've got no GED to um say Gabrielle was a was a d okay actually doesn't really work with this example but say you were playing Lewis this week would that make you less likely to want to play seeno oh what if I was playing Lewis and seeno in the same yeah it would because I hate that I hate so do I so that was the other Factor it was like I was always going to play Gabrielle over Lewis because I felt the goal threat from Gabrielle is far greater and I thought that E I thought well maybe Arsenal will concede City will concede so it's then go threat so it's always Gabrielle and I I was pretty certain he was going to play Gabrielle I don't think there was I don't think there was much doubt going into the game week that Gabriel was going to start based on what we'd heard and what arteta had said not that you can trust arteta but so it was never a choice between Gabriel and Lou it was always do I go three at the back or four at the back and bench seeno so it's or leou that's the nine points that I lost out on on my leaf days yeah I just don't don't get why you we've Le I guess it was it which not likely to score is what were your think because I played him at home to Everton and they lost 3-0 that that was that was honestly that was the fixture right yeah I should have I I I yeah it's not okay we're on your team now we don't need to do the whole thing on on Lea Davis but yeah that is going to sting I think for a while that that move but when I I can't I can't so I just I can't believe pep said uh one player we can't rest is Ric yeah it's funny everyone said didn't they in the week oh that means he's benched for sure I didn't really think that I I didn't think for one minute Lewis wouldn't start it was just most likely get me some points but I was surprised how many played Lewis and how many owned some meno I sold a lot of people sold seeno as well he was a mwe for Palmer and yeah yeah so I was surprised he was such a differential when when I got a signal and I finally flick in through teams I was like oh blame me actually s meno could work out and he did which was great so yeah last a bit of luck yeah I mean he is the dominant player for them and it's a good time to look at the ticker I mean Balmer fixtures Now brenford Brighton wolves those three in particular very very strong from an attacking standpoint they'll probably concede but having seeno for those for that Run's pretty good and it doesn't you know they're fifth on the ticker here over the next 12 I say who really impressed me that was kirz with a two yeah he was yeah cuz I I had him I had him last season do you remember when everyone went for zabani and I was like oh I'll take the punt on on kirz that'll be fun misses out in the first double game week zabani scores and then they then they concede that was yeah so you talk you talk about there's little things like kirkus I look at him think you you let me down that time it wasn't even it's not his fault he didn't get picked you know but I still look at him think that was that was your fault but yeah I think kirk' stats are really good we we going to talk about a bit later but he's another one four 43 is there's some decent options emerging around like the four the four fiveish bracket and and the thing is it's like no clean sheets but I think you've got to just consider the attack and return potential now there's no clean sheets anywhere no no I mean not even Arsenal now as we're we're going to touch on um it's it's now about you know which which Defenders are most likely to get you something in the in the attacking third um because finding Defenders who can actually get you clean sheet I mean like in fact you know vardia was now described as the better option over Lewis which is crazy because it's like it's leis is cheaper and so he's the cheaper route into the city defense but because all we care about really is attacking returns because we've given up on clean sheets you go bario and it's it's weird it if like people saying now which city Defender they'd say AIO even though he cost more because because Lewis is really only getting you clean sheets he might get assists you'll probably get one goal maybe two over the season but V is unquestionably the more attacking of those two and now that's all we really care about because was it two clean sheets for City and I don't think they're coming anytime soon Brighton Spurs Liverpool they're not going to keep a clean sheet in any of them games I don't think no and is a problem with Lewis because you know he's he's 4.7 4.8 um he's his place is at risk each week I mean I expect him to play most games but he he will get the odd he he will he will miss the OD game when when Walker comes in um he hasn't got as good attacking threat as some of the Defenders around his priz and he's not keeping clean sheets as well so it's the thing I'm kind of playing him each week because he's a man city Defender I'm trying to I'm thinking okay this is statistically one of the best defenders in the league and obviously one of the best teams in the league and it's I'm I'm losing out to players like Leaf Davis and eight Nory and kirz and Lewis Hall and stuff who also aren't getting clean sheets but have a bit more going forward he's becoming a troll he is like I I look at him I mean I probably will have to play him this week because I don't really want to play Rogers and field but maybe I should because you know City at Brighton again I feel like they're going to concede Lewis probably isn't going to get an attack in return so what am I looking at a one or two point I might as well play Rogers and roll the dice maybe but I don't know I'll make up my mind later in the week maybe I'll read an article about Rogers and be convinced by that again but that's what it takes when it's so close you just it is I guess in a way you can when you're in my position well go against the EO and go well if if the player with lower ownership go with that person but I guess out of Lewis and Rogers there's not much in it is there so the one cave I would say on the strategy of of going with what players are saying about themselves is don't forget Nicholas bner who was the most arrogant you know if you went by purely by that he'd be your captain every week because of how well he spoke about himself but the thing is seeno had a sausage dog as well and he was really nice in the video and it's stupid isn't it because you start thinking what a nice guy and he's got he's got a dog like mine and yeah and then 10 minutes later the pep stuff comes out and then lo and behold I'm going now I'm going to start some menu and of course that must have fed into it it's so weird I don't know but it is it is you've got to be careful what you expose yourself to when you're looking at your fbl lineup because if you're on Twitter too much or you read too much or you watch a video or something obviously the biases come through don't they and you know you got to be aware of that and it could often go completely wrong the antithesis of Harland for you who you uh don't feel don't speak so highly of yeah I should have just stuck with my guns not gone on Twitter and made up my own mind but the fomo was made worse by all the ferar about the hat tricks and everything you you read about when I didn't have Harland there was all this talk of him getting what 40 goals this year suddenly that's all evaporated no one's got him anymore I'm looking at everyone's team everyone him and everyone's talking about Chris Wood like all the pundits and everything Chris Wood's getting all the attention about like oh isn't it marvelous how the oldfashioned number nine and suddenly the talk of Harland has completely I'm keeping the fave yeah Wai in the good let look at this um shows your am and he had Sal oh God my I just realized look at my formatting on that disgraceful the OCD is kicking in I've jsky salers aligned to the right as is mine and your Holland I'm should have corrected that never mind ignore that past can't see it um lots of Salah captains which surprises me I didn't realize that most of that way and obviously three hars yeah and and I because obviously it was Harland who make W guess for most of these teams when I checked through teams as I do when deadline passes I look and see what other people have done a lot of people made the Harland out to sell a move which paid off in the short term um but um yeah it's a big it's a big commitment how how do you feel about that now because you're looking at this you're probably one of the few managers along with myself who probably still got him yeah I mean I thought about it I thought about doing um Harland out for sou Harland I think it was Harland and as well as the salanki to himz move it was going to be Harland and uh because I've got dibling to Salah and himz I think it was I was determined to get himz kind of one way or the other and glad I didn't but I think it I would have I would have about broken even on it because although Salah would have come in and got the the goals I would have benched Rogers who scored so and then obviously with the hit I don't think there was a huge amount in in kind of in not doing it um I thought about doing it this week again not for himz this time but for for kuna um but as a spoiler I'm I'm not doing that so I'm going to be going another another week without Salah um in my team but yeah I I I kind of I expected it to be more split I expected there to be more I know obviously this isn't just all the people that have sold Sal I'm sure there's people here who have got Salah and Harland as well but when I was doing my my check of you know all the managers around us did you do that as well believe oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah I couldn't I couldn't quite believe how many how many people had sold him do do you have an order who do you have an order of whose teams you look at first oh yeah yeah of course because you do judge like I don't think it's a good thing I don't think it's very healthy but you do judge yourself by what other people have done how they're doing I know I'm I'm pretty sure people like Ben krin and general don't do this at all because they're stronger mentally and think that that probably affects them and it and they're probably right they're definitely right but I always do that when deadline passes I look at what you've done what Andy's done what late RIS has done what slippers has done yeah you know what I mean Raptor I look at his team there's probably about a dozen managers I look at and you like compare your players to their who go oh he's got him but I've got him and then he's got him and I've got him that can a little bit a little bit I'm more interested in what transfers they've made um because I don't watch the deadline streams so um it's it's I don't know what is done and things like that so I always like to have a look um but yeah it's I don't know how healthy that is to compare yourself confirmation bias of B the kid yeah I think I think a lot of it is if if if people are making similar moves to you it it feels quite good it was interesting though because because I looked at all the Sellar outs and all the Harland outs are in and the sell's in and I still just feel that there's not enough in it between seller and harand for me to to to really think that he's 100% the way to go I know s's been like unreal and unbelievable but I still find it crazy the the the points harland's got over the last two weeks you know and all we can do is forward tell me about it and I I don't know I look I look at I look at Brighton I look at Spurs and I look at Salah with um Villa and uh and Southampton and I think I don't know I don't know who's going to win out in that you know a people will say it's obviously going to be Salah but I I don't think it's that it's that clear cut to me I wouldn't I wouldn't be at allall surprised if if har came back race against follow no question there's not a massive gap between them but there is a gap in the money that's fact right so it's like what can you do with that that difference in funds I think also what is facted is City aren't in a as good a place as Liverpool so that's fact as well right so that's I think you know on a Level Playing Field Salo and Harland is not a lot in it and arguably harand sealing is higher I think it is but at the moment poor in this groove of winning matches and salah's just doing what he always does like CU i' I've had periods where I haven't owned him and you watch him you think when he's not playing well I'm going to get away with this and then he goes and gets a penalty or goes and gets a couple of assists at the end or gets a late goal and you think he's come out with a nine 10 point return out of what was a poor performance um and harland's capable of doing that as well but normally with Harland it's like it's kind of signposted he doesn't normally sneak of a turn it's like within the first 20 minutes and you're like oh God this is going to go really bad yeah exactly where Salah could just turn it like that that's the difference and um I guess that's the player he is it's true I mean it feels to me though that once Holland's gone I feel like that's him gone I don't really see how you can we've all used the wild cards or most of have used the wild cards so if you're selling him for Salah and okay there's midfields with Salah sacker and Palmer which look like unbelievable and I'm seeing some amazing teams out there without Harland but what do what are you going to do if you want Harlem back and I guess the answer to that is nothing right because you're not going to move you're not if if you're if you're taking the Harlem money and you're putting it around your team and you're putting into those three Assets in Midfield I don't see how there's ever going to be a point in which you say okay I don't want Salah anymore I don't want Palmer anymore I'm going to move back to Harland so you're you're done with him right that's that's how I see it until the wild card I agree yeah I don't think you're getting him back with three transfers no no because you have to spread the funds the only point in getting hland out of your team is to spread the funds and hope that that makes the difference and in a world in a landscape where we have got Palmer saaka son Salah and as we said last week a cast of forwards who are doing their job and getting maximum bonus from one goal spreading the funds should compensate should I would say but it's the recency bias again isn't it of we've just come off harland's most miserable run in his Premier League career for City one goal in in five he's I don't think he's done that before if the under if the underlyings were like the same as they had been against Newcastle and wolves I'd be in a very different place and again maybe this is where stats we we focus too much on on stats so maybe he just isn't a really poor era of confidence and he's not going to score but he's getting he's getting so many chances still um I'm H I'm happy I'm happy to keep him and and see him battle out against the the seller the seller owners but obviously they're both both great picks those of good comments coming in um that isn't one of them L because he's agreeing with you thanks um I I love this later on though uh this is uh this is from uh flimy Joy Bassel Bank Great Name this is like go back to the Scout cast he's put a rough with the smoth in look rough B in Salah but after too much drinking I forgot to confirm my squad so he sat my oh my God no sat on the bench oh the move for fimy was Rogers started in place that is a smoth same points same point yeah exactly it is did yeah did he Captain well he probably Captain somebody else but yeah some lovely stuff coming in and um yeah SWAT saying don't forget to like a lot of people agreeing with you I mean triggers in the chat saying he thinks it's S easy to buy harand back I mean it is it's two transfers I think it's a mental thing though is it it's that yeah it's that mental block in terms of you've done the effort to get Harland out you've spread the funds and then to almost go back to him feels like you're turning a sea tanker isn't it it's like I I don't I don't agree I I don't think back because I think if you if the easiest way to buying back would be to sell Salah and I don't see when you're going to sell Salah even if he blanked in the next three games which he won't but even if he did it still be like it's still seller you know playing for for Liverpool he'd have to go completely off the rails in the next five or six so to get harand you have to sell one of sacka or Palmer you're not going to sell one of sakur or Palmer with the Run they've got cuz the fixures are unbelievable you're not going to sell Palmer before you know like home game against wolves or you know whoever they're playing are you look sacker before West Ham it's this is the going to happen I mean we're going back to the ticker and the two teams top now this is the blackbox ratings by the way not the default ratings on Scout Scouts ratings are great but I like to tweak it a bit make Forest a bit more difficult you know let's face it that is a harder game than Scout right they're not bright red they're a bit bit less blue um but Chelsea and Arsenal are top of the ticket over the next 12 you know Chelsea got AR they got each other this week but after that they both got a fantastic run of fixtures and City AR far down the ticker but it's the next three for City plus if you look at this run for City we've said it before Brighton away Spurs Liverpool Forest Palace United Villa out of that run of eight fixtures seven fixtures right the only game that I would say is straightforward unless I don't think United will be now because Amarin the new manager first derby it's got to be more difficult for City you'd think the only fixure there I would say that City will win maybe easily is Palace away but cellers parks's a difficult place to go and by the time by the time they get there in game week 15 glasa might have sorted them out and made them hard to beat at home so I look at that and just I don't think there's an easy game there Forest at home would be in a couple of Seasons go but I don't think it will be for I look at I watched City last night against sportting I thought if we played for city tomorrow I re and Forest have a good chance because we we are incredibly hard to break down and Incredibly good on the Counterattack and I watched City and thought they haven't got many ideas at the moment they needed de Bry are on the pitch because they just quite predictable they are predict and and they're light in Midfield like the team you you can play it you can play out against them pretty easily and cut through the defense that's like kovic in that holding role um just just doesn't really work for me and and Lewis or Walker at right back I mean they're all good players obviously they're all good players and they're all capable of a bit of Magic on the but I would think looking at this Brighton are going to fancy it Spurs are going to fancy it Liverpool are definitely going to fancy it and unless de Bru is fully fit and harland's firing again I think Forest will go to the EAD with the best chance of getting something they've had since they've come up no question no question at all so I don't think an easy game there for them yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm giving Haren the next two Brighton and Spurs I I I think I probably will sell him ahead of Liverpool away because I could move him down to Salah who's who's he's got the home game um or over to sacka who's got West Ham which I like AR Arsenal hav't exactly been great I mean Arsenal last night were were pretty dire I mean they had a lot of the ball but again it was predictable there a lot of crosses to a center forward who doesn't exist yeah yeah J jezus came on and really couldn't generate much from that sacka was double teamed all the time and was frustrated and couldn't really Martin n is not offering enough down that side and obviously OD guard's not there odard cominging back we'll talk about it late is huge absolutely huge and so you know we've got odard and de coming back into these two teams it could make the world a difference let's look at some data though let's start because we're probably going to run on to three hours otherwise but good chat good chat so far lovely comments as well coming in so it's good um defense for the season a few things I want to mention here and it's not Forest um Villa I mean what did you make of the 4-1 at Spurs when defensive dat they're four feir 0.99 XG conceded non penalty per 90 and they were second I think on this table going into the Spurs game obviously they've slipped down now it's crazy isn't it I don't know what's going on with Villa they they seem both frustrating as a defensive unit even though the data is good and a little bit Limited in attack I mean I look at Watkins and he's only had more than two shots in one game all season wow that's a hell of a stat that is yeah I had a look in most games he's getting one or two shots but he's only had three in one fixture so far and he needs the Watkins of old needs volume like he's a better player now and he's better at taking his chances but my preconception of Watkins before last season was where he's going to need five or six chances to score I don't know if he's a striker who with if he only had two shots in the game could get the numbers he got last season what do you think about that yeah I mean when I watch Villa I think when they're on song and it's and it's clicking between you know biley Rogers Duran Watkins obviously they've got like Ramsey coming on T they've got players who when they link up and play really well it looks really vibrant and it's really attacking football and really quick like transitions across the pitch looks really good but there's been quite there been a couple of games now where you watch them and it just looks a bit laborious it looks a bit slow and that was happening against Spurs and then when when Villa scored from the set piece I kind of thought well that's that's it now like this is happened to Spurs so many times they' been in complete control conceded the goal and now they're going to kind of fall apart and they didn't they just they just carried on doing what they were doing before and once they got one it was just a matter of time before Villa kind of crumbled because they weren't offering no anything when wers went off they were like just limp I don't know what he's so key he's so key to them Morgan Rogers it's unbelievable um didn't didn't see that I thought he'd be a good pick for us at 5 million but I didn't think he'd be like the the Talis almost the Talisman of the team after 10 weeks don't know what's missing I don't know what it I mean maybe it's you know obviously Lewis has left and he was a big figure last season um anal has come in and he's perhaps not as mobile he's not as Dynamic with the ball and they've missed Lewis's set pieces because that was a big factor he was he was a master of those wasn't he mcin seems less of influence biley definitely is the fullbacks definitely are as well Rogers and Watkins have looked okay but they've kind of looked like their partnership is absolutely key if that's not on song yeah they're really struggling it's it's weird there's a lot of teams in that kind of bracket I would say is is when when they sold dougas Louise I thought this might be the kind of problem they'd have because he was that kind of yeah eight role who who box the Box just linked everything so well they signed Anana and I thought okay Ana's more defensive at least he has been a Everton and then when he signed he started getting them the goals in the first couple of weeks I was kind of thinking oh they want something here they they've literally made a like for like placement with a player that I I didn't expect but I do wonder if now they just they just seem to be missing that energy like in the Midfield between between the defense and the attack which which Louise gave him so well and that ability with him to pass the ball you know he his passing was was Unreal last season he could pick a ball out from you know from right across the haven't really got anyone that's looking up and and trying to put a ball over the top so much like Watkins isn't getting as many I I thought Villa against Spurs Watkins would be thr on goal like over and over and over again without there yeah yeah but it just didn't seem to to happen and Spurs played well I thought drasin played played really well in that game but I didn't feel like they tested them that often by trying to put those balls over the top and trying to get Watkins involved and I was surprised at that CU I thought that was probably their best their best weapon Matt saying it's all about fixtures yeah it is but let's have a look at their fixtures if you look at the short term they're they're pretty bad um you know Liverpool away Palace at home Chelsea away I mean it's all about the home games Palace brenford sampton you'd think that they would I'm certainly brenford and sampton and you're GNA you're going to hold Rogers probably for those two but the away games are tough for them so it's kind of they're one of those teams that have got fixtures that are on off on off on off there's no sustained spell other than those two Bren that brenford santon over a longer period yeah they're right down there like over the 12 they're third from bottom so it I also think as well Lo losing to club bruge was I mean that Tyro Mings picking the ball up and giving a penalty that that's a bad result for them because they were flying through that and coasting and now that Palace game looks good the one sandwiched in between Chelsea and um Liverpool but then they've got Juventus after that Palace game so you've got to think you know Watkins isn't going to see 90 minutes in in that game they might even take Rogers off early in that they play brenford and Southampton back to back but after Southampton which is arguably the best game you can have this season they then go away to Red Bull leig and Juventus will be an interesting game because if they lose that game to Juventus and then they've got to go away to Red Bull Li there's suddenly going to be a lot of pressure on them to get a result in that match so again um we talked about Jackson before and how he's starting every game and you know Watkins and the Duran threat but there could be more rotation coming I think particularly over over this period because of though the the import if they'd beaten Club brouge I think that it might have eased it a little bit but losing one nil was wasn't really a game I don't think they could afford to to lose it's 8 nil Chelsea at the moment 8 n oh my God first team out I know the other thing I want to say about Villa is Jan right and when Rogers went off it was interesting I mean never talk of an injury but he didn't want to go off and Emory said interestingly yeah I don't think the injury is too bad because he didn't want to come off but I wanted to get I wanted to get two forwards on I've got thoughts on on on it does make me wonder that because Jan is there and he's like on a leash and he's proving himself and he wants to get starts as soon as there's an opportunity to get him on the pitch Emory's is like yeah I'll take that because in the back of his mind he's thinking if as soon as there's a window where I should consider putting Jan on I'm going to take it so as soon as Roger's got a knock but he's off get Emory get Jan on and it'll be the same for Watkins as well like so that is a thing when you're take when if you're owning Watkins and Rogers if they get with 20 minutes to go there is no question they're coming off because he he's looking for a chance to get Duran in on the pitch to keep him appeased now maybe that's speculative but that's how it seemed to me in that game because I don't think I think Rogers could have stayed on and they might have done better my my thoughts on on on Morgan roggers in that game and I'm a big Morgan Rogers fan don't get me wrong because I takes of a pinch of salt but don't complain about getting subbed off if you're going to spend 5 minutes rolling around on the floor okay crying in pain and then your manager Subs you off and you go what are you doing I'm fine don't roll around then just get up get on with it if you're fine get up you think he'd know you think you think Watkins and Rogers go on thinking Duran's gonna come on with 15 20 minutes to go so let me let me make sure I don't give em a chance I've never I've never I've never seen like it cuz like so when son got subbed he was he looked good he was running around and he was like what are you doing R just got subbed and did the same reaction you've been rolling on the floor for 5 minutes man um let's move on um City uh slipped down here but you know chances per 97.6 which is extraordinary clean sheet slow as we said you know we talked about Lewis andard already um United the big chances is the highest though so when they are getting a chance it's 2.3 big chances conceded per 90 Palace have got three I mean they're City are certainly the biggest in the top 10 aren't they other than Bournemouth so yeah they are conceding uh The Wider big open chances yes um and Arsenal have slipped down and suddenly Liverpool and Forest are the two best defenses .81 0.89 um don't laugh um United what you make United because obviously with um the new manager Amarin coming in the talk is all about Bruno and we'll talk about Bruno in a bit any anything making you think maybe we should reconsider the defense cuz it's it's 14th here so this would cons this would say no but but they've had the most clean sheets have they this season uh they've done second most one at one point they they'd had the most I don't that's that's continued but I think I think it might beings must must BEP four four clean sheets yeah Liverpool got five Liverpool got six I believe yeah for they were at one point they the most but now now it's um now now it's okay now they're third but still it's it's not bad I mean I am getting swept up in the amarim hype you are already are you I am yeah I can't help it I mean you watch that performance that they put in against City and you see the way he's got them playing and um if you watch Monday Night Football as well you saw some of the stats that he's bought into to sporting um this is the bias I was talking about with some if you watch too much of this you get you're going to end up buying gar oh you really got it oh yeah too late that was before as well you're so vulnerable yeah I know um but like you know top for Progressive carries top for BL shots top for XG top for goals all the things and okay it's what what Cara described actually as a a league um enough just a bit but and and you know Manchester United aren't aren't one of the top teams in in the league so it's going to be a a difference um obviously but yeah I think it is exciting I think um I've been watching a lot of like tactics videos about him we're going to do a bit on am him in in a bit uh but it's it's going to be really to see whether he comes in and tries to stamp the you know the three the back formation the wing backs the kind of three rotating sing side forwards uh all play or whether he he kind of keeps going with with what rud's rud then T been doing so yeah I don't I I think you if you're going to if you're going to buy into it you have to buy into it now because of the next three pictures it's got to be the attack lad rather than the defense I would have thought we'll look at we'll look at it in a bit it's interesting because you said about when you watch tactics thing I think it does affect you before the season started I did a lot of work on Moresco and slot and I looked into slots tactics if you remember I showed formations on here didn't I and I thought out of that I thought this is could have influenced me and it did cuz what I did well there was two things I could have done I could have gone Diaz cuz I was convinced that one of the Wingers was going to be more inverted than the other and I thought it would be Diaz with Salah staying wide and that is what we've seen so I could have gone Diaz that would have worked out well I didn't go DF did I I went bloody quono instead you got it right for 45 minutes I got it right for 4 cuz I went oh I'll go qu cuz he's going to play and he's a four million Defender and uh he's definitely going to prefer the ball playing Defender cuz that's how slot likes to play yeah so rather than take the the Diaz lesson which would have been marvelous cuz he got like five goals in the first three or four game weeks I went for bloody quono which last his 45 minutes I'm so gutted I know yeah you it does affect you doesn't it when you've when you think you're on to Summit I go oh I'm gonna go for that so you got to be careful gotta be careful but yeah I mean you were you were right to go for it you just went for the wrong one of the of the of the two options I mean you call Liverpool being a you know a good team but a more kind of functional team a less chaotic Al then again I mean coming from klopp it was always going to be a slightly less less chaotic team but yeah I don't think I can claim that saying Liverpool a good team is that much of a grand move I I yeah but I I I think I was expecting more of a more of a drop off from them than we've seen I thought it was a big job to replace such a legend in club and I thought there might be a bit of adjustment period or a bit of time to to take but they've been absolutely yeah unreal outstanding top of the defense uh not top of attack uh because Spurs at top of the attack and I don't think that that is surprising given what we saw against Villa and it is the basis on which I I've gone fre Spurs hoping that that would get returns I guess it's surprised that he Chelsea up there but then you know they banged in eight tonight and I guess that explains why Palmer from game rout 12 is is such a priority what is surprising is Arsenal I think you know they're not the best defense now that's been carrying them they're like four in the defensive data based on XG on penalty conceded they're down in six here 1.58 behind United Liverpool Chelsea City and Spurs but OD guard's back and and that that that could unlock them right I I hope that does I hope the handbreak comes off a bit and hav Herz and sacka become you know I'm not scared of havs and sacka at the moment for me though that's that the difference is odard I just I just think there there completely different team to judge when they've got him in the side and when they haven't cuz when you look at the front three when you look at the Midfield three of what Marino um rice and well part has been playing at right back for a bit hasn't he he played Midfield last night it's been hav havit have been dropping in isn't he to the eight and and and I mean it's just there's just no there's no creativity there is there there's nothing there's no one that can unlock defenses in that Midfield three they and Martinelli don't bring enough to the party do they yeah they and they've both been poor they've both been poor this season they they were last I mean jayus um if I was if I was playing against Arsenal and I saw Martinelli trossard and Gabriel jayus in the side I wouldn't be filled with fear like they're good they're good players but they're not League winning they're Squad players in in my opinion um and then you look at that Midfield fre and you think well who in that Midfield I mean rice is going to run around and and do a great job and obviously he's got a lot of talent don't get me wrong 80 million pound player he runs around a bit but he's not who's who's going to be the person to play that killer ball through you know and if they do play the killer ball through who who's who's getting on the end of it I don't they ring they're relying so much on sacka and and you can he's not easy to shut down let's face it he's getting harder by the season to shut down but you can I mean they did a good job on him last night and it showed how you could restrict them when you do do that and they they're desperate to get odard back there's no question and I think I would then expect them to climb this table and and we've said if you look at the long ticker they're right up there for the fixtures and from game 12 onwards or maybe 13 West Ham away that's where you got to get on them I think again there's a brilliant comment in the chat if you could if you could flag out from no weak foot uh just saying they need Smith row that you know what that is that is exactly who they need well he would have played wouldn't he he would have played I think he would have played I think I think he'd be starting I think he'd be starting the matches that odard was out if they had him in because they haven't got another player that can drive with the ball like he does and and and play a ball through to to some of these forwards and Wingers I think they're really it doesn't surprise me at all to see Arsenal sick on this list because I just I think they're quite I think they're quite ordinary at the moment yeah but we expect them to pick up and we expect them to climb his table again and and threaten United attack is up there we talked about the defense does the presence of them fing this table 1.60 before Amarin gets there does that make you even more tempted to go all in well the issue the issue the issue isn't so much the the stat this year is the lack of goal I think they're 18th for goals lack of goals this season or or something like that and again you look at the team and think where the goals going to come from because holand isn't I don't think Holland's a 20 25 goal a season Striker um rashford hasn't been on it for ages garnacho is really wasteful You could argue Amad deserves to to start but he's I think he's got a couple tonight but I'd be probably more surprised than not if he if he started the weekend um so so where the goals coming from are the goals going to come from Fernandez is he going to L step up well he hasn't scored more than 10 goals in his last three years is he maybe I'm completely wrong with that but definitely you know I'd be surprised if he's I can tell getting more than that you go go there you go you go that that's go bang on bang on 10 goals in bang on 10 goals that's his Premier League career um so obviously his best season 32 returns 2021 when when we were talking about him being the new king of fbl even over Salo at that point God it's not great is it and it's been it's been deed since um 19 goal returns last season though 34% of the uh goal involvement he's on 33% goal involvement this season because United have been so poor at scoring goals he's only had three returns but that three returns is enough to get him a third of the oh my God yeah it just shows you doesn't it how they've struggled because they've only scored they've only scored nine goals and which I think it's Southampton has scored fewer so Amarin has got a bit of a BL canvas but he's got a lot to do isn't he and and Bruno's got to be the player that I mean let's have a look at let's have a look at United's cast here zi we can we can count out on the grounds that he's put on some Timber apparently but you know ACC report apparently yeah he's he's a stone heavier than he should be according to V tenar when he left your man gun atos up there in terms of points per XG I non penalty per .52 just ahead of Bruno and gacher is the more palatable if you're going to go anywhere because it's 63 compared to 82 for me though it's about losing a Midfield slot to United player I'm not sure I'm ready for that I'm okay I'm okay with v next three this is the thing because there is no better fixtures than than Lester rip switch and Everton if you were to pick three fixtures yeah it would be those two maybe West Ham would would be one of them but definitely or obviously South Hampton if if you had all three PR teams in a row but you know in terms of in terms of a three I think that's that's excellent um the question is I mean if amam comes in doesn't matter what tactics he brings in doesn't matter what formation he changes what players he brings Off the Bench or whatever there isn't players in the team who can score goals yeah he's got to change that mentality and he's got to get them scoring and I look at that cast that you've got on there and who's going to fly in that who is who is going to be the one that steps up and starts banging in the goals there's a lot on Bruno Bruno Bruno's got to get 10 goals again I mean if you go back at these numbers he got 10 10 goals last season 10 in 2122 he's got to hit double figures again yeah hasn't he because I don't I think you're absolutely right you look at this and think I'm not sure gacho can holand might be able to if he trans to me H's the one though holand is the one that needs to step up because he's the only nine in that team xery xery isn't isn't good enough this season I don't think he's going to need time he's more of a link player isn't he he's not he's not an out out his reputation isn't that of a goal scorer necessarily they can't s rashford up front because that doesn't work they tried that they tried that every year and it it doesn't work so do try it every year it's only Highlands there that can do it so he needs to start scoring more regularly has to yeah I me I mean he's got it in him but I just think he's still one maybe even two seasons away from his Peak um well he is need to St need to stay fit need to have a prolong period without in injury but I think it's you you're right I think it's it's not just tactics and formation it's mentality if you look at we look at this amarin's going to turn up and we think he's going to favor a 3421 and these both these images are both courtesy of Sky's recent article by the way which you know I've in danger of being biased by reading that but I'm not I'm not going to go all in on United as might be open to persuasion but I don't know how quickly he's going to move to this whether he'll land and go right three at the back Wing backs will he will he do that do you think or will it take time cuz I I was looking at like predicted lineups for for manest United if they if they switch this formation and actually they they have three good center backs for this formation in yoro Martinez and delit well yoro isn't fit and he's 18 years old so yeah I don't see how he can play delict and Maguire in in a back three I mean the teams are going to eat that up for breakfast AR that's Martinez carrying a lot then in that so I I I don't think he can go to a back three if if if it's until Yo's Yo's back um they've got Ma do for the wing back slots and sure if he's if he's ever fit they could also play gono at at left wing back I was going to ask yeah whether you think he's going to end up at Wing back yeah he could do is interesting because he he tends to be the right wing back that's the more attacking um one and that's that's what the graphic that's what the graphic shows here sporting average positions under ammer in it's it's right hand side that's where is the more attacking side so that's Dow that's got to be that's got to be Dow I would have thought mazra is a good player but if you're and it could be Fernandez yeah if you're going to bring in the most attacking for Wing back is it's going to be Dow on that side um I don't know if gacho is is totally suited for a left wing back role is I mean unless you're literally just telling him to stay past the halfway line I mean his work rate isn't no isn't the best is it well I mean if he's going to end up there teams are going to Target that aren't they teams I would yeah I would no question oh my camera's gone off um no question at all that they would Target that um but um yeah I I I mean it's it's the right side Midfield behind the forward which will be holand which is interested um that's where we think Bruno is going to play right it has to be it has to it has to be Bruno because the the two Center mids have got to do so much running and you've got to think that's going to be mayo and agat right because that that is that's what they do that's like the roll in in the so they actually seem perfect for this system in in the Midfield um and Bruno seems perfect in one of those inside forward spots I think when when United have got like a fully fit team I think it kind of works because you've got Martinez deck and um and yoro you've got Shaw on the left you've got dallow on the right ugat and um I mean casir is just just out isn't he um ugat and uh and Mayu and then you've got Fernandez rashford and and hland that works but if you take a couple of those players out through injury or or whatever suddenly I don't think the system they haven't got the squad to I don't know to keep to keep the kind of momentum or to make changes I don't I just don't really see how he how he brings this in straight away and implements it he needs players basically I think he needs time and I don't think he goes to this straight away you have no sound Mark what have you done I was so well sorry I was interrupting you anyway I muted to get my camera back on um he needs a transfer window doesn't he yeah he does I think so yeah I I think that he's one or two key players from this formation I don't I don't think he's got enough Deb foot win back to play this week in week out he hasn't got that Center back like you say that's fit and I I don't know if rashford and Bruno are going to play behind the striker in those rols I mean Bruno definitely can rashford it could it could be Amad like a few like a few people are saying but that's a big step up yeah it just feels like to wear pegs to me it does a little bit a little bit Yeah considering the pressure he'll be under to get results I think he'll rethink it and stay with the four at the back initially and then do what he see what he can do in January basic that's way he'll go yeah all right let's look at the regular stats of players not too much to talk about as always other than the fact that you take Allison out the equation because he's injured on his way back SS is the best keeper now in terms of points per 90 4.8 which is crazy um you ruined him for everyone I Blame You entirely I not good enough just didn't see it at all but he's been outstanding four clean sheets but obviously been bring in some saves and bonus as well um wanted to talk about um Onana here cuz you know he done well with the four clean sheets of mention and that could be if you really want to go united I'm sure United fans are itching to get more players in and Nana could be a logical step because he he has done well even under tag so you'd think there could be an improvement under Amarin as well um fleen we've already talked about so there's there's not too much movement here other than I think that yeah reyya will come again I think with the fixtures we've seen um given where Arsenal are on the ticker and from game 13 onwards I don't think Forest at home is an easy game but I don't it could be a clean sheet I don't know about you but I do expect to want to move back to two Arsenal Defenders um from about you know from 12 13 ORS are you thinking I've got them I've got two I've still got Ry I've got I've got Gabrielle it's been a rough ride up until now but I look at that run you know Forest West Ham Manchester United Fulham Everton Palace ipswitch brenford you know 12 right till 19 that's what eight games it's easy to say isn't it I mean you'd expect three or four clean sheets yeah minimum from from those um if I was picking a goalkeeper from gameweek 12 it would be ryer yeah so I'm happy to I'm happy to have him yeah I I think that when I move Harland out some of the money that is cleared will be to try and move back to two two Arsenal Defenders you won't keep I I find it I mean he's done all right for me he's got a couple of Falls so he's got he's had a couple to be fair he has he has but I I don't want to take him Beyond I mean like this is with good fixtures as well I mean it was interesting though to watch brenford atam and they said that they spoke to Frank before the game and they said would you take a one- nil or 43 what you prefer he goes always a 4-3 and then his team put on the most flaccid performance I've seen for some time right well it was it was ridiculous wasn't it it was like oh we're we're won that up that's just it basically Cooper it was I couldn't believe I couldn't believe I was watching yeah of of all the teams of all the managers to put in performance like that I could not believe it was it was brenford it was ridiculous it was like 45 shots or something was it to like four it it was it I mean Ando was just nothing he was more fullback than a Winger wasn't he I mean he played down the middle yeah come I mean it was strange so I do wonder whether Frank is suddenly going you know what I'm tired of the four threes and let's go but because they were once a side that were built on a bit of discipline at the back set pieces when they first came up that's how they build that that's that's what you do when you get promoted it's what Forest did you you you have to grind out results they became a bit more of a flare team who scored goals this season and played a different style of football which just left them open I do wonder if he's like time to move the dial back but he doesn't want to admit that be interesting but yeah there's no doubt find the middle ground yeah you don't you don't need to be up there or you know bloody on the bottom find find a nice Middle Ground you got to attack Fulham a little bit I don't agree with sexy B saying is rough two world is an injury time I don't think it was rough at all I think it was completely deserved completely deserved that F and won that game I mean they didn't I mean brenford here 15th for the defensive weight data 1.71 they did have a a tough start but they've had good fixtures recently um remind me what their fixtures are like short long term they're pretty bad now so they've got these three ever leer then it falls off a cliff right there's no way I'm taking fle into that one I mean it will be saves Gore but Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest Brighton ARs they're not they're not getting anything from them's getting a 50 pointer in one of those games a one nil a one nil against Chelsea away where where's the clean sheet coming there Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest yeah but he'll do it to SP because that's what that's what these players love to do they love to spite us I mean I I'm even looking in buo and thinking I don't know if I want him over that run no I'll be selling he's he's too highly owned I think to to keep um and you know that's that's that's pure black box that is too highly owned to keep too highly owned to he's boring isn't he everyone's got him you don't even get you don't even celebrate his his points when they when they come in um I mean Villa Newcastle Chelsea Forest Brighton Arsenal nah we can do better in Midfield I think over that certainly be sing the analytics crew will be shouting skill issue at you now I saying that and me for saying it as well but you know he's on pens 90 minute man ever present perfect algorithms absolutely love him regardless of fixtures but yeah I think you're right I think that if you're trying to push up trying to push towards you know 100K which is what we've got to be aiming for you perhaps have to roll the dice against inmo for that run because it's dismal there's no question um y I guess I guess I guess I guess the question is where' you go but we can cross that bridge when we get to Midfield in a minute um I don't really want to talk too much about tread because we did that last week but Simas he is he is now the starter and he's third in this table 0.26 which there's a whole gaggle of Defenders around that 0.2 bracket Trent out on top 0.36 so above them but only just it's not a huge margin and with the it test as we've seen simic talk to me about him 4 six taking set pieces has that more quality than Robertson I would say in terms of delivery and actually in terms of xgi outperformed Trent in that game last weekend I think he came out 0.56 and Trent if I remember the walkout video was about 0.15 or something dismal like that so simcast definitely can offer us something how close now are you is it week by week we're getting closer to letting Trent go how close are you I mean Sim is is on my wall there on side after the after the bench boost uh last year so obviously a big fan I don't necessarily think he's a step up from from Robertson I think he is this season because Robertson has has obviously you know declined in in a lot of areas because he's getting on a bit and fair enough but you know I don't feel like Sim is like a new signing who's a great left back necessarily I think he's a squad player who has kind of been thrust into the role because Robertson has has you know gone down I wonder if they're going to move in January for a new left back and Manchester United are going to be moving for a new left back as well it's a very popular I mean England don't even have a left back so it's it's a it's a highly sought after position with not too many options available so yeah be see what they what they do Trent yeah I mean like you said I think we need to talk about Trent a little bit because again I don't think the Run of fixtures Liverpool have got lends themselves so well to clean sheets coming forward I think after that Southampton game uh it's what Everton it's Newcastle it's man city as well and it's going to be hard for him to justify 7 million unless he's getting more regular returns um attacking wise because there's so many Defenders who are getting good attacking returns would I move Trent to Simas not a chance you would not a chance you're just you're just I would go anywhere near Simas I I just don't think Robertson comes in every now and then and plays Gomez can play on the left as well can't he he could come in for a game I don't think Simas is is like too far ahead of either of them so avoid for me okay and and you I'm look at Liverpool's fixtures they're not great I don't believe they're okay I mean they've got that City Newcastle 134 which is tough way I'm looking at this thinking where's the clean sheets coming from here Villa I I I actually think they can keep a clean sheet against Villa they certainly can against sampton but after that I think the next three or four very tough because they've got City Newcastle Everton and Spurs I mean I guess they can go a good as some part plenty teams can but it's a bit different when it's a spicy Derby isn't it even calv Louis might score in that one but yeah I I think yeah I think I mean there's clean sheets there for sure but um in a world where those fixtures are tougher the problem with Trent is I just I want it to happen I want that game to happen where he just gets those couple of attacking returns and everyone goes ah yeah I do need him I do need him after all yeah well hopefully it's going to be one of the next two because it's filler and Southampton yeah and then it's the the the poor run I mean if we're selling Harland and we're selling Trent where the hell's all our money going yeah it's true kogo you think that um Min is going to come back in don't you you don't think that role on the right side in front of elman's going to be his you think he what moves back to left back at that point then do you I'm very surprised he's been he started so many on on the wing because obviously gruda is there as well who's very highly rated HZ said he was really excited to work with him but clearly hasn't uh hasn't done that I wonder if if maybe R could move over to the right now we got Pedro coming back and O'Reilly's back in the squad too so and and M's back in training so I I can't see any World in which kyogo carries on on a right wing there there's too many options that can come in look out for o Al by the way he's he's absolute quality I saw you tweet today about well there's a number of players who can play the 10 it won't take long before O'Reilly gets the 10 and it's and it's his in my book I think he's well then the question where do pro then where does Pedro play yeah it's it's a problem because I I think O'Reilly is going to be a starter very very quickly because I I just think he's exactly what you need um for me he's so technically good he's a scorer of goals and a Creator I think we need a pascal gr we need a pascal in in that 10 he's not as consistent as gross so and he has been in a weaker league so let's see how he adjusts there's no question but he's got all the tools so I would have thought that he will end up being your 10 by the end of the season just how quickly he goes in I don't think he's going to be a fantasy asset not yet he could be next season though so C GL said no not much going there well whoa well well well I don't I don't I don't think he is a no I just think if you're expecting him to start on the wing again you're probably unlikely I I actually still think with Brighton's fixtures after C I was gonna say yeah yeah even are strong right yeah even if he plays at left back I think he's a good option I think he's really starting to adjust to the league now I think he's first choice I think he plays every game I think he's he's the best defender we've got and the best one of the best players in the squad now he was signed of a massive reputation and we're really starting to see that coming through I would expect some clean sheets over the Run of Southampton Fulham Leicester Palace West Ham so you go you go over you go cadog over dunk or Barco would you basically very good I still think Barco could come good at some point but sorry I'm joking yeah I'd go I'd go kogu dunk was dunk was interesting at the start of the season because we thought the set piece threat would would be there but hasn't really materialized I think kloo is is the one he he's a bit riskier than dunk but he offers a bit more yeah okay uh okay I put some Chelsea Defenders at the end of the table here none of them kind of featur in the top 30 well they don't it's not kind of they don't um but Chelsea's fixtures are very strong and we're all about Parmer from the attack as well we haven't really touched on Sanchez as an option any Chelsea Defenders tempted you at all I mean I think it's interesting Reese James coming back what' you make of that not not going in for Reese no yeah I mean he's not he doesn't look the same kind of player at the moment is he obviously he's trying to build build Fitness up but yeah he he looks like it might take him a little while to to get going um I mean Gusto is the one that's maybe yeah more impressive because he's inverting a bit a bit more and getting forward but I wonder if that's going to carry on maybe when James is back to his best he go moves back to right back they got I don't see I think it's going to be inversion on the other side it's it's just whether karella takes Gusto's minutes away that's the thing and he could because karella is more natural perhaps in that role I just don't really there's just not a lot to like is there about the defense they they con see goals they there's there's like rotation around those kind of more attacking spots you're not going to go for CWI or for far cuz there's much more attacking options um for for the same price um yeah hard aoid and the thing is as well like we said it didn't we earlier in the show it's like there were four fives like Davis like eight Nori who offer you a bit more in attack and Gusto and karella can't really even though they're inverted they can't really compete with that they need the clean sheets if if Chelsea suddenly turn into like a defensive Juggernaut then then maybe we can consider them but maybe I just I just can't see it fair enough uh Midfield then let's look at that uh the Bo's top which for ages has not been worth a mention but he's coming back and it was interesting to see him I I I don't can't work out what pep was doing last night that night wasn't last night night before wasn't it 4-1 down they go 3-1 down and N Gallagher expert Co comor that he is was calling out for uh he was he was doing cooms did you see that no Gallagher no he was doing no he was doing he was doing Co coms with Dan Fletcher and um I can't remember who was on with Fletch but it was it was no G gone I know so they had they had a shamelessly saying we're going to have a fan of one of the teams as a co- commentator I've never seen that um and he was saying promoting the tour and stuff he probably gave him a lot of money about I've never cuz he kept saying we he kept saying oh we're this and we're that oh great it's great isn't it when a when a co- commentator is so so unbiased um but no Gallagher was saying oh this game's crying out for Kevin he was that's the other thing he was doing he's calling players by their first name because yeah oh who does that yes as if no Gallagher gets to wander into the city dressing room when he likes to have drink well he probably does so fair enough but um yes I know what you're getting out there but he was he was basically saying um Brennan he was basically saying this game's crying out for Kevin at 3-1 down and he was right I was like well they need a bit of invention maybe Kevin can come on see I'm doing it now he can come on and turn it no he doesn't bring it him on then so we were like thinking well he can't be fit then can he he can't you know if he's not coming on now he's not going to come on he can't be fit he's on the bench to make up the numbers they go 4-1 down with five minutes of stoppage time to go and pep goes come on Kev on you come what's that about he's just come back from injury the game's gone there's five minutes left game gone you're right yeah why would you put de boy on I just I mean I know that I'm not pep none of us are Pep and I know he's a genius but even Luke I think would struggle to work out what pep was thinking there with the game finished and with five minutes to go that's when you go oh yeah I'll tell you what kev's been out for months but they stick him on see how he does in the last five minutes very strange decision but it was it was also strange that he was on the bench for Bournemouth and they were 2-1 down desperate for a goal and they don't bring him on in that game is like what's the point of him even being on the bench in that point of him being on the bench in either of those games you've got to think that it's it is a numbers thing rather than name three Keepers they're putting de bruyer on and then if they're really really desperate they bring him on and I get it but why bring him on when you're 4-1 down in a game that you know they're not knocked out as a result of losing that game so why why try and he's not going to turn it around is he in five minutes the the only thing I can think of is is is he's trying to give de bruyne like a psychological lift that he's been out for a while and now he's gets to come back and feel the grass under his feet and hear the crowd and all that that's but that is clutching that's all I've got imagine someone gone through him and he's out for the season just because of that five surely you I mean I don't know I mean who am I to question pep but I thought it was really odd well he done it before with de Bry didn't he de Bry was out for the whole preseason and then he chucked him into that first game was it last last year or maybe the year before and then he was out for like four months and then pep was like I probably shouldn't have played him in that game he wasn't really ready why'd you do it then anyway yeah what' you make of that impact on thoden I mean we expect it to help Harland because deyne is Elite when it comes to creating chances there's no there's no one in the league like him um that's why he's top of his table do you I mean I can't see foden operating out wide and Bernardo Silva starts so surely de Brer back means fod and becomes more of a question mark right yeah is a strange one because I can't see a world where foden gets a prolonged period of time out of the team because of do you not his quality well no because he's he's just he's just one player of the season and he in the games I've seen even the last few he's he's he's he's he's you know he's been very influential in the last couple of games I know they haven't won but he scored the goal against sporting he he had a good game I thought against Bournemouth created loads of opportunities in that created like what four big chances in the game against Southampton um as well the issue is like you say is is where' you playing because they they've got Savio on the right who I think is excellent um foden we know from last year worked best with Walker bobbing past him so he could kind of Tuck into the middle not really going to get that so much with with Lewis um so does he play in you know I guess it's him and de bruyne in Midfield but then they haven't got the where's Berard going then but the trouble is they haven't got the um they haven't got the cover cuz it's all right to do that when you've got Rod doing the work all the Dirty Work behind you they have to play gundan gundan and cover have to play don't they I I I don't think I don't think gan's been good at all since he's come back from from Barcelona so I think they've got a real I mean it's obvious to say they're missing rodri but when The Replacements aren't really stepping up it's a big problem and you're right I mean I I guess Bernardo would move over to the left but then they've got um Nunes there as well haven't they yeah I don't know I think it is a problem for foden um I've got I've got one more week with him I think he he against Brighton he's got a good record against against us as well um but then I think he is an issue but I don't really see how he can not play him but then I don't really see how he can play consistently I think de bruy just doesn't play every game I know I think I think if you're GNA Play De Brer it's going to be in Europe and it's going to be the tougher tougher teams it's going to be the games that you won't fow them in the easier fixures I think we're still going to get that but it's going to be interesting Mojo saying I don't he's trying to give him some minutes and a done game what's weird about that cuz it was a stoppage time it was literally the injury time he brought him on for 5 minutes isn't going to benefit ala did it with oard last night as well didn't he he gave him like two or but the game wasn't Out Of Reach yeah it was 4-1 so it's like with odard coming on you think well he might do something to get them a point still late though I don't know why you they were one goal behind so I could sign of see the logic of it like he might 10 minutes though yeah but I still thought it was I mean even though I agree the de one the de one the de bruyne one is is weird I think it it it will when de bruyer is playing I think it will have an impact on ph I think it probably means he goes out to the right still but we think he's less effective there with with without walk cup so yeah indeed uh Diaz and Salah Diaz with a hattrick um yeah yeah I said in my walkout video that it was only Salah really and then Diaz goes and get the hatrick to shut me up um yeah what you think it's going to happen this is this is it's going to be like this all season jot comes back scores a brace Diaz gets a goal gakpo suddenly is the the best it's I'm just not going near it you're I can't be I I can't be dealing with it I I do think though di Diaz should be playing through the middle over Darwin do you I like that that's that gakpo Diaz Salah is that is a potent front could that be a thing I think so cuz so I think Darwin's been all right but I still don't think he's got a long-term future so in a world where Diaz starts looking like he could play centrally well then that then I think that change I mean when J's back though you've still got that question mark around Diaz and J but if J's out for a while and Diaz is playing through the middle then but yeah 100% you said tonight you were in a sleeper call and you said that Dan fbl mate offered us Bowden for Diaz yeah he obviously feels Diaz end up being down the middle that isn't quite that isn't quite what happened I I tried to pressure him into selling phone for Diaz what are you doing without my permission we assistant manager you we co-managers what you yeah well I thought once it once we got the offer then we could talk about it it was you know I had to I had to give it the big the big talk at the time to try and get the off from the table you're just trying to get your own back for the fact that I turned down himz for intia I kept intia now he's injured and I missed out on all that did did you turn it down yeah turned it down oh I thought we missed it I was saying today I thought we miss turn it down also threw an insult Sal as way and think oh do you think we're stupid you might be able to catch us back from the pub I was I was always oh after that yeah yeah anyway oh that would have been a great move yeah thanks Eddie will come good don't worry a couple of years be fine um Palmer injury just a load of nonsense injury if if if he if he doesn't play I'll eat this hoodie there you go yeah I I I can't help but think that mesa's gone okay alessa's playing nonsense with sacka and all this stuff about you not not pitched in the training picks and obviously they play Arsenal next and Palmer is like Palmer's a player that would if Arsenal thought he wasn't playing it could completely change their tactics so you got to think the mesa's like well yeah there could be you know he has he's not trained today and all this he hasn't trained because he's not playing in Europe and we know that and he wasn't in any of the picks and all this stuff and it's I don't know maybe I'm wrong for me the Martinez challenge the contact was minimal it wasn't a regular challenge I know moresa said that and you're right but to me it didn't look like there was enough contact to make Palmer injured out for the weekend but we'll see I guess I think I I I actually think it was quite a quite a nasty knock and it is the kind of thing that I could see being a bit of an impact injury that keeps you out of training for a couple of days but there's absolutely no way there's enough in that to keep you out of Chelsea versus Arsenal with the way Chelsea are playing and at a time when arsenal were beatable at the moment this isn't the Arsenal of like the end of last season when they're winning every game Chelsea look at that game and think we can do them over it there there's just no way Palmer doesn't play that game he just 100 I'm like 99.9 reoccurring percent sure he starts he'll get patched up and play I don't think Chelsea do it but we'll see when we get to predictions what I think there but I think that um Palmer plays yeah for sure absolutely it's not muscular it's a knock that's that's the key thing and he and he's with the England squad as well and he would have they would have pulled him out of that I mean moresa could have used this as an opportunity to pull him out of the England squad and said oh he's got got a bit of a I re it's Palmer saying don't pull me out of it because I'm you know I've got to make a St for Tel I'm fine yeah yeah see I buy that um son will be a Target if Bren if Palmer is out I mean the natural thing would be for those without Spurs players going into the IT switch game if Palmer is known as out obviously you move Salah if you can if you haven't got him but I would have thought son would be the natural step down if before the break and then obviously you have to go back to Palmer after that if you add Palmer and he is rolled out would you hold him through the break for 12 given that obviously that's when we need him for that fixture run or would you move him out and spend two transfers what would you do yeah and the other question I did the Q&A with Sam for scout earlier and she's um she's on a w so the moment she's got Palmer and no son and I kind of said to her why don't you well and she agreed like wouldn't you go for like son you know move to Palmer afterwards because she haven't got she hasn't got value tied up in him either she's buying Palmer for the first time on the wild card um obviously you're booking in a transfer and everything like that I can see why you might not do it but yeah I mean even take I mean taking a one if you're going to take a one week punt on a player son surely is the one that you take the punt on um got some minutes in Europe tonight home game against IP switch I mean's he's arguably the best Captain this this week isn't he if you were free hitting you'd be very tempted to give him the cabin yeah I mean you because he's got the pens right so that's the edge he's got over salanki and koseski and Brennan and that is is the pens um right no well and Johnson I could call him jonno if you like jonno um it's even worse yeah but I I I'm I'm I'm I think that's the that's the step down that people will do it is a step down in price and then you have to obviously get Palmer back once he year fit I don't think it's going to be I think it's a nonissue no question though if you're I think you're right on the wild card if you're wild card in this week like Sam is you go in you go all in on Spurs don't you and then exit out game week 12 surely you go porro salanki and Son don't you if you wild I I I think so unless you're taking Palmer out and losing like triggers put in the in the chat if you're losing like 3 yeah 2 .3 then then I don't think you do but if you haven't owned Palmer like some idiots you and I up until up until now yeah I think I think you definitely go for go for some go fair enough uh let's take on forwards then uh not too much to talk about that I want to talk about J Pedro though he's not high in his table because he hasn't been about he's 23rd .35 X on ped per 90 coming back though with those good fixtures and he then enters the conversation that has been dominated by the likes of himz wood um kuna recently I would say Cal Le but I don't want to keep mentioning him um where do you stand on Jia Pedro do you I mean like I know the algorithm is absolutely love him and they're throwing him at me going he's on pedal is he's gonna you know they love him the models love jaia Pedro um so he's he's going to find his way back into teams isn't he well he'll find his way back into teams but will he find his way back into the team that's the that's the big question that's what I'm asking you as the Brighton f as the expert very brave asking me to predict Brighton I feel like I've completely lost lost my I mean what you know I'm I'm not even going to try and predict what what the what the 11's going to be but what I will say is that we've got some really good strikers for the first time in quite a few seasons who were playing 90 minutes we've got chriswood we've got kuna um you know you could we' got salanki you got Nicholas Jackson with good fixtures you've got vissa you might be keeping Harland these are all you got Welbeck who's playing like every minute as well havs with great arsenal fix You' got so many good fix so many good players do you want to bring in a player who if he starts and he plays for Brighton will score points because he's a great player and he's got penalties but he has such an unbelievable amount of competition that none of those other players have in his position yeah I do think Herz Herz loves him though does he he's he's said things to give us indication that he's he sees him as the man the the player who can turn a game so absolutely but you've got Rutter playing in the 10 at the moment who's been exceptional for about five or six weeks now so I don't think I don't think Joe I think I think he's been I think he's been more than all right I think he's been brilliant I think he's been an excellent player and he's our record signing as well I think it's very harsh if Pedro's fit and comes straight back in and replaces russer I think P I still think Pedro's I've said this all season I'm probably gonna be completely wrong I still think Pedro's best chance of getting into the team is as a nine and and taking the place of Welbeck can taking the place of won't do it it won't happen it will it will not happen this side of Christmas there's no way so he's either taking mat's place on the left or he's taking the 10 we've got O'Reilly back like we've mentioned we've got R who I think has been playing really well you got three players for one position why would you go there when you've got other Strikers who are first choice I mean talking of other options I haven't mentioned either hazards or ISAC but they're they're edging I mean havit with the fixtures he's edging back into the picture isach with a little bit of form how close what would they have to do to get you looking their way esack is is is someone I really want yeah I he's yeah the fixtures are good look right the fixtures are really good and he's he's one of those one of those Strikers on penalties Talisman of the team and I just think Newcastle was just starting to turn a little bit of a corner with the way they're playing football now they they've got kind of a system that's working for they always look a bit more on it um great win against Arsenal to give him a bit of confidence as well and yeah I mean that West Ham game in 12 I know I mean that's the thing is it cuz 12 is the pivot that's where we all probably have two or three transfers and we go Harland out Palmer in and then it's like who comes in for Harland and obviously there's Jackson in the equation there's kuna maybe would but the fixtures are turning isak's got I mean havitz will be in that picture because all right Forest isn't easy but after that it's West Ham United Fulham Everton Palace hit which good run but isak's going to be in that in that you know in a week's time or after the international break when we're sitting here doing this this show then we're going to be talking about where we go and isach and havit are going to be on the menu aren't they well yeah look at the start of the Season we thought isap was going to be in our teams all year there wasn't there wasn't any well there was there was obviously a couple but use the the Cal expression there was very few managers who went without EA game week one and okay it was a great fixture against Southampton at home but the general consensus was he's going to kick on this year and and do really well and it's it's been a combination of newcast not playing well the injury he's had but I mean yeah I I love that kind of Talisman forward for a side and he plays West Ham Leicester and ipswitch in six games as well with brenford thrown in and Palace who he should get chances against too I really like it if you're selling Harland in 12 or 13 um I think eack is is is one one of the best Pi it's just a differential that it'll be and I can say West Ham are probably the worst Premier League side I've seen at the city ground in my time since we've been up I thought that was it was they were so bad I mean I know they were down to 10 men but it wasn't wasn't a lack of they've got good players don't get me wrong but just in terms of the way they were looking around the pitch completely lost no Direction no identity it was so archetype a team that didn't believe in what they were being being told to do or or anything they were doing it was so obvious from just watching the game and Forest were just like well this is Dick this is just we're playing around them and they're not there was just no teamwork no Spirit everything you don't associate with West Ham they are gone unless they get rid of ly and all the talk is I've watched a lot of Le I watched a lot of West Ham stuff after the match because I like to see what they say and they were obviously talking a lot about their own situation as you'd expect and they were saying that they don't think Sullivan will get opy out because of the nature of the how they got him was relationship with the agent and so on and if that's true if Sullivan does drag his feet getting ly out because I I have no doubt it's not going to work I don't see him turning it round West Ham have got to be put in the bracket that we've put the likes of itswitch and Southampton in terms of that's a fixture we need to Target no question could score two or three goals in that game well absolutely and and you look at you look at some of the other teams you look at Everton and they've had spells this season where they've looked all right they're still a team that you wouldn't fancy any given week but they they've got players in the team who can like Harrison like O'Neal like McNeil sorry like I'm not even GNA say Cal Lin but Betto up up top theyve got players in there who can who can under dice you always feel like they've got a system I think Southampton been better last few games they've been playing quite quite well um you know Big Win obviously against Everton and and played pretty decently against against Man City and spells too uh you look at IP switch I think they've got something about them good manager everyone's kind of fighting for the cause I look at all the teams and I think there's positives I look at West Ham and I really struggle to find the positives in that side I look right through the team and think where's the where's the quality there is quality there I mean Kudos is out for another two games that's a blow Bowen is is an exceptional player I mean it's and P Bowen and petta peta's gone though he's he's gone I mean honestly not he's offering nothing to that team but this is the problem right they've got qu if you if you look at West Ham's three best players it's Bowen petta and Kudos yeah Peta when when he's committed but he's not now he's not but same it's the same with Kudos kudus is the same kudus is an unbelievably like talented player but I I don't I wouldn't rely on him every week to put in a eight or nine out of 10 he's he's got an attitude he's got an attitude may be but I think L's got something to do with that lki took him off at halftime at brenford what was that I don't know what was going on so maybe there is off the pitch stuff I'm just saying West Ham is a far easier game at the moment than perhaps people think I mean based on I think W I think West Ham at home if I was picking a player in a game I would want West Ham at home yeah at the moment for my player Spirit wise there it's not it's gone they're gone they're gone they it's such a shame It's like because I want you know they've got good players who could be really useful to us but I yeah I mean that's why isak could be a real big differential game week 12 for sure no question at all um thought we do predictions let's talk about our sponsors as yes so it is sleeper of course we mentioned them already uh the sleeper draft we're playing FPL mate who's top of the league uh in that uh in our in our next game obviously if you're watching or listening to this you can't get involved in that but what you can get involved in uh is the blackbox pick them game which You' probably heard us talk about already essentially if you zap the QR code that's on your screen if you watch this on desktop or there's a link in the description it will take you to sleep app download it completely free enter into the blackbox pickham league and all you've got to do is pick the outcomes of all the games in the Premier League and the person at the end of the month who has predicted the most correct outcomes wins a prize up to the value of £500 so we've given away an Apple Watch a PS5 and a Google pixel I believe phone not yeah yeah we're just taking them for ourselves I've got well uh but yes get involved I know yeah we're just we're SLE bags but yeah get involved and like I said completely free to play you're supporting the stream if you get involved and hopefully you can win a great prize uh too so zap the QR code or use the link in the description uh OE sack I don't know if you're a West Ham fan no quality have great players play yeah absolutely I agree I mean I think I think petta is not the player he was he's unquestionably an absolute quality player kud also I think amazing player Bowen an amazing player they have got I mean obviously Antonio is not what he was so they're struggling up front and I don't think Bowman can play there I totally agree they're just not playing for the manager I I don't I don't think I don't think they've got a great team they got fabianski in goal with Emerson starting Juan basaka I don't think's good enough for a for a the decent side he's not good enough if you're playing three at the back he's good enough if you're playing four at the back but he's playing three at the back and he's asking him to contribute up the field which he can't do as we know so wouldn't take any of them a Brion all right maybe bow I mean was I was shocked by how poor they were cuz I know they're much better than that when I saw them um anyway uh it's getting harder to get this screenshot as this is the lead of order predictions but every week I seem to have to scroll down to find you I don't know what's going on so the table's getting small it's getting smaller font every week as I try and make it long fing yeah 54% I'm on now I'm see I've almost caught hot iron in terms of correct outcome percentage now he's on he's come down to 55 so yeah yeah yeah I mean fair enough you're fresh me on outcomes and score you you're doing really well uh this I think this is this has got to be the first time I've been below 50 because 50% is always our Target isn't it if you're doing if you're at 50% you're doing all right uh and yeah I've dropped below the the magic 50% Mark so I need to I need to get back on it um you do indeed hard season to predict it is uh over 1100 watching we've only got 200 likes what would you say that was you say that was ridiculous as or what would you say that was I would say it's ridiculous this and I'm saying if you're watching this and you haven't and you haven't liked the stream uh you're a ridiculous person so please please do especially if you're a West H fan cuz I love you really I just just think it's a shame um I'm going to see um West H Brighton with fella over Christmas I think it's like the 20th of December or something like that yeah and we got a 50 Quid bet on um on Brighton finishing above West Ham this season I think I mean at the start of season I wouldn't have said it but yeah I think I think you're going to get that now um but I think West H will turn it around but not unless Sullivan gets L out sadly right uh let's go for our our predictions there's no there's no early kickoff Saturday I don't like that I don't like no really kickoff yeah hate that oh it means the leaks could be more prominent couldn't it as well which I don't like oh God Ian there's not exactly many there not I just yeah I don't want all that don't want all that again uh brenford Bournemouth defense straight away interesting you've got 2-1 brenford I've I think brenford are a good team at home and I think bourma for a poor team away from home so I thought this was I thought this was quite a sensible one yeah buar struggling away from home uh I just don't think brenford defensively are good enough to keep them out and I do wonder whether Frank has kind of like I say mve the d a little bit in terms of what he's going to allow them to do in I hope he's learning his lesson and he's going to go back to the fun chaotic brunford of old yeah uh so you've gone one two one one way I've gone two one the other fair enough Palace Fulham difference of opinion here as well you've gone on the way win one nil Fulham I've gone one all want to B yeah yeah I think it's quite an even game um I just think fmer are a better side than than Palace at the moment Palace have got a lot of injuries with wton and and E both outs again not sure when they're when they're back or if they're coming back if they're both out again then they got big problems so I'll back for them winding their sales after their comeback and look at this difference again you've backed West Ham you're going 2-1 West Ham over ever I've gone 21 Everton I just couldn't back Everton yeah I don't know I think I think at home um you know I I think this this was just this was just done by the Home fixture I think if Everton had been at home I'd have gone for an Everton win um I don't think there's much in it between them but West Ham maybe just to just to Nick it and buy him a bit of time before the inevitable sacking in a month no question West Ham and a better side and they have more quality on the pitch but I just I don't know I just think the fight's not there and I think if Everton get one up they'll go two up I think West H might pull one back so that's the narrative I'm going with um set pieces I think as well Everton will cause them problems because we certainly did they didn't look that secure and set pieces defending them um so yeah I think ever will win it probably have a couple of Corners Michael Keane and tarkovski probably or something like that uh w s Anon we both agree on the outcome you've gone 2-1 I've gone 3-1 kuna returns here yeah we haven't talked about kuna um I just did an article about him on on a sports casting where I mean his his stats are are crazy I didn't realize well I didn't hey how many attacking returns he got last season he got 17 um which is incredibly impressive he was averaging 4.7 points which is the same as Bruno Fernandez was last year uh you know I know I know we kind of sag off Bruno a bit but you know still that's an elite player playing for a topish side compared to one playing for a struggling uh wolf side the chances created most chances created of all forwards um I think it's like the third most shots of all forwards as well or something ridiculous like that he's just doing everything everything you you want you forward to be doing he's he's involved with um yeah I think he's going to get something out this game yeah I mean we talked about him didn't we last week in terms of his relationship with the bonus is good because of the chance he's created and plus wolves don't keep it clean sheets so score a goal or or get any kind of a turn and he's straight in the bonus plus he's on penalties they know he's going to be in that discussion when we do the next episode when we're looking at forwards to replace Harland which I'm sure we will be uh fixtures are still good so yeah but this is the fixture to own him for isn't it I mean I I think he comes out of this with potentially double figure return um and maybe Ain Norway gets that clean sheet but we'll see um in Man City you've gone 31 Man City I've got I've given you a point you just don't fancy it what does Chris say what does your dad reckon do you know what I I I don't even I don't even think I I will stick with this when because obviously we still got time to to kind of edit these um I I I think it's 3-1 either way do you how's that for for sitting on the fence I I worry a little bit that we we go for blood against them and we just get like annihilated yeah and caught and foden turns up and Harland I mean they score I'm sure they score no no doubt about that yeah yeah um it's you know it could it's going to be a really good game and it's talk about garden center game this is not the game you want to miss uh this this weekend um but then part of me thinks if we do go out and go for them and and we could actually play them off the park and then if we score a goal early and we get in their heads maybe we do go on and win it fairly comfortably I don't know tricky one I've I'm going to B the pessimism it's the easiest one to do is it it's your own team so I'll back City but yeah I wouldn't be surprised Bri W this uh we got consensus on the 8:00 kickoff Saturday it's Liverpool Villa we've both gone 2 nil routine I think that looks it done it for Me Villa are just something it wrong yeah obviously the traveling is going to I mean this is their third away game in a row having gone to Spurs Bru and now anfield that does take it out of you and they just seem flat don't they and I think obviously Liverpool had the European game as well but I just don't see them slipping up they're not slipping up are they Liverpool no I can't really see anything other than than a routine I mean that I think Villa will they've got the potential to cause problems because they have you know good players but who's going to benefit I think they I think they can kind of put a shackle on on roders and I don't think they'll got caught up with balls over the top like maybe they used to do under under klopp so Watkins might struggle a little bit um yeah I think fairly routin United Leicester you you really are all in on United here aren't here 3-0 well they've scored nine goals All Season they're going to get 30% of that in one game here against a Koopa low block seriously and it it's the first time that um that Leicester won't score All Season against Manchester United uh I'm bought into the amaron hype you really are I think I think the players do you know what there was a lot of criticism about Manchester United against Chelsea I thought they were all right I thought they did all right I think they did enough to to win that game um you know with some of the chances they I think Chelsea were the better side overall but I think United created more opportunities in that match they've won again tonight they should be beating Leicester comfortably with the players they've got so I'm going to back them to do it give rude his his send off I enough and this is interesting Forest Newcastle it's the the only Garden Center game I could pick out of this lot because I'm not going to go Chelsea Arsenal although actually I do think in terms of spectacle Chelsea Arsenal will probably be pretty dull um and the predictions we've gone we've kind of backed that up you've gone three2 to Forest I've gone one all three2 do you know what five goals in this you think Chris Wood hatrick he did it last year at St James he did he did and there's some players with some beef with Newcastle we've got we've got Chris Wood obviously got the hatrick at St James's part last year we got alango who they were after and we didn't let go to Newcastle they came in with 50 million right at the death and we said no so alanga would want to play up and see if he can tempt them again in January and we've got aliot Anderson who obviously was let go and they didn't want to let him go yeah good he's a fantastic player so we've got we've got three of our most important and influential players with something to play for here but Newcastle will turn up with a bit of form yeah I I I I think it'll be a very good game in terms of it being a tactical battle I don't know if there'd be a lot of goals but you think is I'm very very surprised very surprised you've gone 3 to um I think one all is a much more realistic outcome and I think if you do need to get down that Garden Center this is probably the only game I would I would recommend I am going to this um oh yeah nice I'm probably going to have the worst Journey ever because it's ra Replacement Service those dreaded free words no so I don't know how I'm going to get home um bigger fan than I am I can't I can't not go even if it's on telly because of obviously Forest are just riding a crest of a wave aren't they so I've got to go um look at this agreement Spurs it which I mean this is not very often we go the same on a score line like this we both gone 4-0 which makes me think I need to be taking salanki Captain more seriously than I am is if you trip triple up on the Spurs and the salanki captain tempting isn't it but you you just think there's no way here that they don't just fres it which right well realistically they shouldn't they they're a great team at home and we've shown the stats today Spurs are the top attacking side in the league it switch to the bottom defensive team in the league so there's absolutely there's nothing to suggest that Spurs won't won't win this they are when you watch them and when they're in full song and sanki has been an unbelievable signing if you take FPL out of the equation what he gives to that team and the way he brings others into the in terms of pressing yeah yeah it's no wonder that they're so H because he presses high he links up the play really well brings in the Wingers who are really effective especially with sbach now they've got even more of a weapon obviously on on the left and I I can't see any way up switch have any have anything to be able to deal with them so indeed Daniel how the turns have tabled exactly it's like only a couple of weeks ago we were like oh kalanki got to go is he but now you know I was saying this to Sam earlier when when Johnson scored I sent a really like pissy message to to yell was like I'm so stupid I should have gone for Johnson over sank I'm so annoyed with myself and all this and then how quickly things turn around and now we predicting 4-0 and I'm going to Captain him so FPL is a funny game Chelsea Arsenal you've gone nil nil I've gone one nil I think Arsenal will just grind this out I think this will be a set piece goal and then they just frustrate Chelsea I I I do think clean sheets are coming back into the Arsenal Armory again and I think this will be the first one obviously as a non-pma owner we're probably both biased and this could be a three all draw with Palmer all in but I just don't see it being that kind of match nor do you by a look of it no I think Arsenal can can contain Palmer when when he starts and I'm sure he will uh it's the kind of game isn't it where like he just it's the kind of game which the Chelsea Arsenal and I think I think it said Manchester United Chelsea was like the most nil Nils in premier league history or something like that these kind of bigger games I always go into it with a bit of an expectation that it's going to be a bit of a ball Fest and Arsenal Liverpool was the exception because that was two and there was lots of goals in that but I think this is going to be a a nil nil or a one nil eitherway thought you say so yeah Matt and FY fimy joyd are both doubting the Spurs clean sheet but I I refer The Honorable gentleman to the attacking data which you know it switch a 0.86 XG non penalty per 90 that is incredibly poor so yes they've got the lap but I think what's the what's the lap in terms of goal involvement have we got that on here we haven't but I think his goaling go is something like 70% so you stop dap it which don't score and obviously dap could could score for them and that could be a factor but I think the the logic behind the Spurs clean sheet isn't the the robustness of the Spurs defense it's the powder puffiness of the it switch attack right well the one weapon it switch do have is leaf Davis from corner and you're benching I'm benching him but if they're going to score if if if ifs swi score I bet it's from a corner from a leaf Davis Corner well yeah I mean Vicario and the Spurs defense are all over the shop aren't they for those God they're so bad set pieces they so they saw it from against Villa just viaro just doesn't know how to how to claim him he's he's a great keeper otherwise but he really struggles in that area okay that's our predictions let's have a look briefly at the captaincy um it's a tough one isn't it really because there's a there's a real spread because we're going to have the Harland owners we're going to have the the Salah owners and then we're going to have those who are going to go off the wall and go maybe a salanki or even an mumo maybe um and it's lovely to see I I I sit here now and think yeah there's going to be a real when I when I check people's teams like I do 11:00 or whatever uh on Saturday I will see a spread of captains across all those that I look at I think it's this is exactly what we wanted what we're going to have we perhaps further on I think so I think I think we'll see Harland I think we'll see Salah do you think it'll be majority Salah do you I think you'll see all Salas I think it's going to be Salah Salah Salah sal sal it does make me wonder I mean Bruno yeah of course mentioned in chat there on Matt does make me wonder whether I should go against that and go Harland or even salanki because there's no question that those three players could let's have a look at Rob's graphic because I think that could tell us a bit more Rob T at robt fbl do follow because he does some excellent stuff and this is just a sample um this is basically showing the um spread betting expected goals and expected clean sheets odds expected goals top of this is Spurs to 2.90 then it's United 2.45 Liverpool 2.35 City are out at 2.05 so not in the top three in terms of surprised it's that way around for Liverpool City I thought you know given it's Villa and there are you know top sixish side and the fact that we going to conc H of a lot of chances more than likely I thought that would be the other way around but interesting does that make you think that I mean that that cements Salah but it also says Salan is the Tilt right I just I sometimes I just feel that you know we do these podcasts we look at all these data we look at all these stats we spend however many hours a week looking at Stats and drilling down and we have evidence to say that we've got the best attacking team in the league versus the worst defensive team in the league with a player who's just scored 16 points scored again in the Europa League tonight clearly okay I don't know clearly now got something about him wind in his sales we've got Salah with a fairly trick which could be a fairly tricky I think he still returns but it could be a fairly tricky game for him we got har bang off form I'm going for sanki I am very very tempted because I think you're right it's like how often do we have the worst attack against the worst defense with the with the confidence that way the only thing that makes me concerned is you look at the Spurs attack and it could come from anywhere it could come from Brennan it could come from son it could be kesi um it could be Madison I mean Madison will surely play this game so so what I do know is that Spurs won't let up it won't it you know you look at city and Liverpool if they go 2N up you wouldn't say they're going to run up 45 nil if Spurs go two-nil up it could easily be 4 five because an won't stop he'll keep coming yeah raton's injured y so did salanki start tonight I was be very no no it came off lank started and got sent off oh okay so charlton's injury for me that made me more interested in sank because I don't see sank getting subbed because who comes on and plays that Central role and if anything think son's going to get subbed because he's back from injury uh Johnson might get subbed you know Mickey Moore might come on on the right he's as well is he right so so Johnson's probably 90 minutes as well then yeah okay I mean Johnson's a fun one he's on this list as at list as well um we know ipswitch are weaker down that that side isn't the leaf Davis side it's Ben Johnson isn't it I think he's been playing for for IP switch I wouldn't trust Johnson then again I wouldn't trust it's a funny one isn't it it is Brennan against Leaf Davis is um because Brennan's right side up against the left side oh okay then I yeah I fav that less then yeah so it's well it's son up against Ben Johnson then yeah if I if I if I had son I'd be very tempted or if I even if I didn't have son I had a route to to get him um I'd be very tempted by that I mean the flip side his Leaf davus does get forward and so Brennan could get behind him um I think he beats him for Pace Brennan yeah I mean I we've both predicted 4-0 so you've got to think that even if sanki doesn't come out as a top scorer here he's going to get a return um son I guess is the player to go for with the penalties as well I'm I'm I am now depending on what videos I watch on Friday night I'm gonna go salanki so if I watch if I watch anything on salanki or Spurs or AB adct which I probably will go that way if you see a video of do slon with a sausage dog that's going to be it isn't it I know yeah that's all he's got to do that's all he's got to do I'm so I'm so open to persuasion on this one that's for sure um if not I'll just play safe with s but it's it's lovely to have a TT isn't it because yeah I mean that's a big tilt on your part for four with yeah well let's have a look at our teams um for it as oh Ry in goal I'm envious yeah Ray is Ray is in goal Al it's not I hope that nil nil comes through your one nil prediction but a little bit une easy it's Raya Trent Gabrielle and Moreno uh as the defensive four it's foden for one more week before I move over to Palmer uh because I've got the money which I'll talk about in a sec it's inmo it's garnacho little bit worried now seeing as Amad has come on and scored two goals in the Europa League uh Rogers he's got the yellow flag but he played in the champion so he's going to be fine and it's harand slanky captain and I did Watkins out for kuna you got kuna that's nice that's nice I do like that team yeah yeah I like it I gu I guess Rogers G at foden you know they're um it's a it's a it's a team which has potential to do really [ __ ] because if if sanki blanks and Salah goes off um and obviously fen's a bit of a gam I'm playing Rogers against Trend I've got double Arsenal defense if Chelsea score yeah I don't know it's it's a team which I it's not IDE like I'm seeing Sam's wild card team for example I'm thinking God it looks strong with Salah saaka and Palmer all in there but then Palmer and saaka playing each other um yeah I know I'm I'm I'm happy to own kuna though the plan was always to get to get kuna I was going to do um Harland and dibling out for Salah and kuna but then I wouldn't have had the money to get Palmer right so you can go Palmer in in what can you go Palmer in one move next yeah so I can do F to Palo next week for so you're not going to go s at all no you're going to hold Harland and not go Salah well harand might be coming in for I I might be doing harand to Salah in in 13 um when when they play each other but it will be Holland over Salah for the next two salah's got Southampton game at 12 yeah but Holland's Got Spurs at home I'd expect him to do something in that and and I'm cting Palmer anyway against Leicester so Salo Liverpool High press against s an oh I know there but then if I go for if I go for Salah then I'm not gonna have Palmer so there's there's always goingon to be someone that I'm gonna be I'd rather have Salah at santon than Palmer at Leicester well I can't afford so I can't afford s in one move so it's gonna have to be Palmer um I do have another free transfer though to use uh I don't really want to play Rogers away I I am I I yeah but what you think so well I was I was thinking of maybe moving for a United Defender and bringing in mazari or do um maybe even for Lewis because if I'm not playing Lewis this game I'm not playing him against Spurs and then I'm not playing him against Liverpool when when I I'm when am I going to play him what about 8 Nori says FB Forest yeah I mean eight nor is fine but they're not they're not keeping clean sheets and you know I I I don't think he's gonna go I know but I don't think he's going to go on and get 20 attacking returns I mean I I could I could I could do Lewis to I could do I could do Lewis to someone I don't know but I quite like the idea of just saving the transfer cuz there's there's not many clean sheets around anyway um Rogers could get something against against Liverpool at least I've got some stake in the game if Trent loses clean sheet so as I'm a little bit tempted by Lewis to um to mazra or d a little bit a little bit tempted M agre I like that one I don't I mean Leicester to score Old Trafford seems remote to me I just think Cooper is going to low block there won't be much ambition I yeah yeah I think Del could go on as well but if if if amam does come in and change the system and and Del playing Wing back I think he could be a really really strong option so there's a py that wants to do it I'm I'm not I don't know I'm 5050 see how I feel comment of the night nooski as your team is not good I see 40 points yeah perfect cheers nooski is there a prize for comment of the night we should have that really if if if sank gets a couple of goals and foden and foden turns up it it's not going to be a midlin result this it's going to be either absolute disastrous cuz I can see Chelsea scoring I can see Newcastle scoring I can see Villa scoring I Strangely I think Trent is your best bet for a clean sheet yeah um I can see foden getting an hour and DEA getting half an hour and foden coming off I can see I mean salanki should be right I can see gacha and Rogers blanking kuna should be right you do maybe it is a middling team maybe it's not foden foden harand slanky kuna that there's those four they're going to with this team this week I tell you what though I think I can catch you this week but it isn't going to be down to fleen fle that's that's your old team so that's a good start that's my is it that's your that's your old team yeah uh Sal against Brighton slanky against oh God it is what's going on here let me uh I don't in that case and I don't think I've got my team let me try uh what am I goingon to do now then uh let me see if I can grab my team you'll have to keep talking while I try and do this show can't even show the right I thought I thought i' grabbed my team that's really odd I don't know how I can do this now can you can you go back to my team then I can just talk through that a bit more yeah uh sorry about that I thought I'd got that right but clearly not um do you know what I I knew I knew that this team was going to get slated by by people this week because it's got players in it that not a lot of people have have got but I've seen enough from har and foden to think they're both still good options like I said I think they're going to we're going to concede chances to them if gacho plays he's playing Leicester I still think he's a good pick should have got more in that in that game slanky Captain's fun [ __ ] is a good good option Rogers Rogers really is the weakest link um in this side this week um which is why is tempting to move to to a dow or a or a mazari um mazra the reason why I keep mentioning mazari by the way is not because I I think he's a better option than Dow it's just the money uh masro is 45 I think Dow is 51 there's a point 6 difference between them and if I am going to be looking to get you know sacker in in the future or something like that I'm probably going to need that money the one thing is when it comes to gameweek 13 and I move Harland out um I might also be tempted to move Trent out as well and that's going to free up a lot of money so that tempts me into just going for do because I think in a few weeks I might have some more money in the bank any um I can't grab my team because I forgotten what the screenshot I'm on a Mac and I don't know what the screenshot button is uh and uh it's too complex to do um so we're just gonna have to just gonna have to talk through my team I'm afraid so sorry about this great if you're on the podcast not great if you're on the stream um unless anyone knows what the screenshot button is on the on the Mac but I I don't use the Mac often enough to know um I'm sure there'll be some this why I hate Max always something ridiculous isn't it and then I can't I can't get the bloody bench in either because it's too it's the wrong format I'm trying just bear with me and I do this hold on three times and do a forward roll and that'll get you a or something something weird Apple up three I mean everyone's saying different things yeah I know I've got it command shift three now I don't know how to get it into the stream let me just see if this works uh let me just go on I don't know how this happen I love that everyone's posting different commands for a screenshot no one's put the same one twice no I can't do it I can't do it it's no good can't do it uh right so my team is I just have to talk for it sorry for people on the on the stream um it's you're going so well Mark until you got [ __ ] I know it was going well yeah um so my team is just for the podcast and for people listening it is GNA be God this is a disaster it is fleen Trent Gabrielle porro Lewis mumo Johnson Salah ameno Harland and salanki um so I've benching Rogers at the moment do I play Lewis or do I play Rogers that's the question I I think they both get one to two points so I think you probably play the attacker oh you did it yeah there we go but I'm dragging it into the wrong screen if anyone would like a little bit of a window into to what it's like doing these with Mark this is it it's I can't do it it's all broken no no no no no two minutes later I've done it I've yeah this is you every week every week it's really blurry though it's not good quality but it's the best I could do so yeah fleen Trent Gabrielle porro Lewis in Johnson Salah Captain seeno maren salanki do I play Rogers over Lewis and do I captain salanki are the two questions I'm not going to make a transfer because I need to save the two for gameweek 12 um with the Palmer question in mind I am I think I think you I think you play Rogers I think you play the it's it's it's 5050 between I think you go you go for the I mean City can seeed again don't they that's the thing it's it's just I don't back Villa to score either so it's not like yeah no but what's more likely Villa score or city don't concede yeah I don't know that's close I mean Liverpool are the best defensive side and I don't think vill in great shape and and not only a villa got a score but Rogers has got to have something to do with it whereas I think it's sorry I I mean I mean City could get your clean sheet but then Lewis may not get you know may not start or may not even get the hour needed to get the clean sheet as well that's the other thing he could be subbed at half time now pep so they haven't got the the fit squad though you got to think Lis will start but yeah I I just it's easier to score a goal than it is to keep a clean J for 90 minutes yeah that's very true and Brighton will probably score yeah maybe it is better to go with the attacking player um again I'm open to persuasion Friday night to see what happens but yeah I think I think you're right I probably will go on the attack I do like the salanki captain cuz I've got harand and Salah covered so therefore the damage that they can do in terms of if they haul is minimized by the fact I own them both whereas going salanki is a big differential and if he did come in with another double figure that would be a big swing in my favor yeah I think this I think you could overtake me this week because there's not a lot wrong here is there are the trip I think poo could easily get a double figure if he gets SP if Spurs win that 4-0 and porro and Johnson both get returns yeah yeah I've got you I've got you you're in my sights we'll see the Rivalry this is the deciding season as well isn't it not it's going to be that last one but it's two all so this is no this is it no whoever wins this black box finishes at the end of this season so you've had enough you've had enough of the Tantrums and the technical problems enough of the Tantrums enough of bloody people in the chat having a go at me about Barco it's over I saw that was that was there some serious Barco backlash I know people been a bit dick in the in the chat tonight so I've given a few people a timeout so they can think about what they've done okay all right I don't I don't know why people have to bring Barco up when was I it it wasn't it wasn't about Barco yeah put you on a timeout next time you yeah exactly um so yeah it's all to play for isn't it I I do think this is what I said a few weeks back you know it's much more enjoyable season we're not doing brilliantly and not many content creators are it's a rarity that you see a content creator flying this season but um I don't think many content creators will say that it's not a better season as in terms of what's on offer from the game right I love it I think it's great and you know I I like the fact people look at my team and think it's it's crap because I look at it and think there's potential there with with foden and uh and kuna and sanki Captain and you know everyone's team is going to be different and everyone is going to be biased to think that players they haven't got in their team aren't as good because that's why we've picked the players that we've got and not gone for the for the other ones um so yeah it's fascinating there's going to be people and in a few weeks there's going to be people with teams without sacka and then people are going to say why is your team got sacka and it's like because I've got Palmer and sah and harand and yeah it's it's it's really interesting at the moment we're seeing like certain premium players dropping in form and things it's going be when we've got if we get if we get to a point where we've got son saaka Palmer Harland and Salah all delivering points and then you got HTS and eak as well that and Watkins maybe yeah it's it's amazing it'll be a great State of Affairs I think the Defenders not keeping clean sheets has has changed things as well because we're flashing money out and the four five ain't nor is suddenly a hot property which you know I love it I love that as well it's great yeah yeah we've got one super chat from at boy to address before we go um thank you very much for the six year that boy and for your you're always there in chat thank you for all your support you always a a support of the show um great showers do you avoid starting a Defender that plays one of your attackers I own vardy and have to have to start Ana or Maz rui so vardy is at United um does he start Maz RI a think you have to don't you I mean I know what he's saying there don't you I mean an I love obviously I do think we could concede there's a there's a world in which we win one nil for sure cuz Newcastle aren't scoring a lot of goals and we are very strong defensively and it could be one of those games where one goal decides it so Ana might not be a Bad Bet at all it's not a bad choice to go Ana but I do think United clean sheet against Leicester is probably the most likely outcome don't you as I love that question because that's exactly what I asked you earlier is how much has that kind of impact on it and ideally you'd play mazari and not think twice about it because it's a home game you didn't have V yeah yeah but then you've got vardy and you're thinking well I want vardy to score and then if he does score I don't want to be annoyed when mazari L his sheet I think it would it depends on my belly for a risk wouldn't it if I mean where I am now I probably would go vard and and Ana and go you know because or you bench or you bench vardy and play mazari and Ana yeah i' maybe think about that yeah I yeah I I don't think but then's got penalties isn't he that's the thing yeah I just don't know I mean like they will low block and they will counter and vardy has got that Turner pace and you maybe United go there go High Line and yeah vard I think I'd play I think I'd play vardy and mrai because I think there's all I think either way you're going to either get points from vardy or mazwi um because if ler score it'll be through vardy and if they don't the mai score so I think i' I think I'd lean towards that but yeah close yeah good good one at booy very good question which kind of chimed with what we talked about tonight good show as thank you for that um thank you for the 1200 still watching and all the support tonight wow amazing and um yeah I I think this is my favorite season for three or four years I think possibly right up there with one of my favorites so far I really hope it stays on this vein and I really hope our teams remain aart um not just our teams but everyone out there as well um yeah and um yeah it's just a much more enjoyable season for it so um looking forward to what this week brings I go into every game week thinking this could be one extreme or the other whereas last season it was like it'll be another small red or small green whereas now it could be a big red or a big green or you know something extreme like that and and me and you are really tussling for the ranks now so yeah I know I'm glad you you you've closed the Gap makes it more interesting I mean that's the thing I I spent so long last season like even at like 3 million in the first 10 weeks I was like 3.2 million 2.9 Million 3.4 million and like that like it's I'm exactly the same rank as what I was like four weeks ago but it's been like 800k 1.4 million 500k yes I you know yeah it's been it's been a lot more it's been a lot more interesting and you know I think it when you see a player like sank gets 16 points and you look at your rank and you see the impact it's had and it's like wow he's not actually that highly owned because people have put so much money into Salah and Haren they can't afford salanki you know you got good managers without without players like salanki because they can't they've gone a different route which is also completely viable and we'll pay off in in different weeks um but yeah every strategy is going to have its time to shine and yeah it's comms in which one was the one which will be which was the correct one yeah Bring it on Bring on another game week maybe R it maybe green but we'll enjoy it anyway hopefully we keep saying that throughout the season thank you again for everyone who joined in tonight we'll see you soon hit the like if you enjoyed it hit the

[Music] [Music] [Music] for,28295,good evening everyone welcome to fbo blackbox ahead of gw 11 my name is asz and look at that mark we are bang on time for the first time i dont know god knows bl is so surprised i look at pangy in there my god thats on time its its the new its a new software were using which is a lot slicker means im a bit calmer i didnt throw any headphones this week i had to get a new webcam though because my webcam broke last night you so nearly did a whole week of like no stress and then last night its as my webcam is broken i need to get an order on i dont if its going to arrive in time its so here we go it was it was so tranquil nothing straightforward it anyway thecam minutes before 10 minutes before we start were in were on time beautiful green arrows as well come on go youve closed the gap though havent you massive week for you massive well talk about that in a bit what else are we going to talk about tonight we got we got some stuff on amar we talk about his new tactics what we can expect three amazing fixures for them coming up so well talk a bit about those ive already got one in my side i might be getting another one so well see what tonight brings on that we got to talk about big dom big dom sanki getting his 16o return making a lot of people very happy near making me very sad cuz i do how close i was to selling him have i told you i know i cant believe it you were going to do what you were going to do dom to ry gimenez right i was going to do dom to gimenez and i had it on confirmed transfers and i did a poll i did a poll on twitter which said something like who scores more than x2 salanki or gimenez and i think it was like 65 him anders people said seriously and i looked it and i thought theres lots i could do with that money i want to be moving to palmer in the future salahs a player that i want i can take some money out and go for him and is i would be sick to my stomach if i had done that move so glad i didnt id be id be id be beating you if youd have done that you would be my godar me imagine that i cant believe you were that close to doing it as well i we did talk about it didnt we because we talked about salanki last week and you said you on the verge of giving up on him and i said i said we got to hold him for the h switch game surely and arent we glad we did because now he goes into that game as what i looked at the betting odds that rob t put up and hes like the third favorite scorer this game week and our teams look pretty good with salanki in there so commiserations to anyone who mov this week is he you going to cat on him right spoiler early spoiler know i know come from g from selling him to captain its a funny old game and if you look at the fixures hes had brighton west ham i switch to come the game that i didnt hold out much h for was this was this villa game and it seemed like the logical one to sell him on but you called it last time you said villa have looked a bit a bit ropey struggling a bit with the champions league the underlying stats in defense were good but starting to tire a bit and i thought spurs were brilliant in that match and rightfully blew them away so it should be a big youve got three spurs assets going into whips swit i know i me its funny isnt it because last week when i got porro and johnson in it looked like ive made a fa parkers they went to paris and they were miserable i didnt expect the returns i didnt expect big returns in the paris game but i thought i might get something but it was always with the vi the home games in mind the three home games that they got in four and but i wasnt expecting the big returns in the villa game so itd be just like it would be spursy wouldnt it if they like drew one and lip swis s got the goal surely not we have got over 400 joining us already and theres european football going on and chelsea what they what six seven8 nil up by now i dont know they were 6 n up after 42 minutes against the armenian minnows that they were playing six nil at halim exactly no cole palmer in that game of course we will all touch on cole palmer but just to give a shout out to those in the chat tonight thank you for joining us thats paul signs thats henn fbl forest you sexy beast nicholas kill tristan cox tony g mr lucian emu show connor richardson i am 1974 at a boy fbo yellow army good evening davis family first tony g j keeg theyre all in tanky no sign of nigel yet im sure hes there in the background just hasnt commented yet thank you for joining us on a thursday night 900 well be going up to probably 11 knowing us maybe a little bit more if theres any super chats in there we will get to them of course of course lets get on with this by hitting your game week mr as your first 53 points talk us through it god youre getting into this like streamer hosting lck you reading names hitting my team i cant wait till the smash and like ill do a bit of that in a minute off to go t is all right week 53 points ryer and trent the two premium defenders who a lot of people have got disappointing each and every week with three and two with the one moreno finally making past the halfway line was nice to see and ana on the on the other side its nice to see the fullbacks finally doing a bit of bit of attacking it was morenos best display from an attacking point of view had an amazing display against salah anfield but going forward last weekend he was just very confident taking players on it was great to see it looks like hes like enjoying being in the side isnt he like you see his celebrations after the games and hes like acting for the players and there real quality like there and i think with ana as well on the other side theyre theres no reason why they should be shackled because they can offer a lot going forward so i think moreno at 44 is a good purchase i think if you offer me the switch to ana id probably take it hes a little bit more but im pretty happy with mor how minkovich didnt score though no well talk about him later right he had one past the post and then the brilliant sa by fabianski for the one that anderson play back to him its coming for him for sure the issue with my defense though was i bought in leaf davis to play him in two games what you thinking here tell talk me through the logic of that you b you have leave davis surely you have to play him in the home games well the logic was im not im going to play trent on i trents going to play im g to play moreno at home to west ham so there was one spot and it was between ls gabrielle and davis but did you think that city would keep a clean sheet at bournemouth i two clean sheets at all season i didnt think any three of them would and the issue was i just thought it was i just thought it was a loss it was probably which one has probably the best chance of the clean sheet in these three and i thought it probably see but when youre talking about leaf davis its got to be whos the best one for attacking returns is it if you didnt think take clean sheets out of it whos more likely to get you an attack in return leaf davis or l okay if you if you if you if you can tell me that you were expecting leaf davis to score a left footed volley from the corner of theen area into the into the corner it happened what they all concede it thats what i thought would happen and i think it was its just a lottery isnt it lewis could have scored a goal if hed started from outside the penalty era gabrielle could have headed one in from a set piece i dont know it was it was a mistake is top for chances created of all defenders but they havent got any strikers that can score ill give you that i dont know it was it was probably it was probably the wrong move i it was the wrong move give the points and i wish i had played him because i i bought i had him for the these two games i had him for everon at home and lester they were the two games i was going to play him in and i went against that thing but so thats nine points lost which does hurt but anyway played rogers though played rogers played rogers i was i was happy with that with his with his nine foden again i dont know how he blanked in that match hes hes now the second highest for xg involvement over the last two game weeks just behind harland who also planked again inuma garach how did garo not get a return against chelsea because hes very wasteful thats why i know but my god he had two great chances in that game harand blanked i dont know how he blanked in that watkins had a great oneonone opportunity against spurs and put it wide and luckily i was bailed out by sanki cuz without him with salah scoring and other things going on it wouldnt have been a very good week so it was it was a funny week it was a week where i think it could have been better if i played davis foden got something gach got something ifs woods and buts but green arrow fen had that chance second half that he put wide it was a good shot that and hes he scored in midweek of course so its coming for foden theres no doubt its just how long you hold him against the options out hes got one more week one more week for me heroic doses says as if it makes you feel better i did play davis but i bench salanki bench salanki i dont think that makes me feel better makes me feel a bit makes me feel a bit sick mr or mrs doses what did you have up front that meant you bench salanki i want to know we all want to know put that in chat ill look out for it lets bring my team up shelby because its a green arrow its a big one 75 do we have to fleen fleen were talk we talk about him shall we that was absolutely painful some fbl gold between us though wasnt it because when he when the clean sheet went in you said to me when do you think hell break your heart and it was inevitable i was like well it always what always happens is you wait until they got maximum bonus and thats when they concede you wait until they hit peak points and he got maximum bonus and then he started getting more saves and he was on for 12 conceded one only fell to eight and i was like what ill take the eight three bonus with the 10 say perfect and i thought to myself the only way hes going to lose the free bonus now is if he lets another one in and this is with what 30 seconds to go and they played another minute of stoppage time and he let the second one in it was funny watching because obiously youve got him i havent and i went for ray im paying more and its been painful owning ry over the last few and i was i joked you i sent you the message and said how long till fleen loses it and as the game started going on i started getting more and more nervous that it wasnt going to happen and he was just going to go on and get this absolutely mammoth hall and i dont know when they scored it was funny cuz because youd said to me whens he going to the pet and then you were watching the stream but youre a little bit ahead of me and so then i just got the message from you saying yep hes absolutely sh and then as i read it i saw him concede and i was like believable it was i was prepared for it so it wasnt as devastating as perhaps it would be for others and id had a good game we so i could take it if i had a bad way game week i think id have had to say to pip i just go out we need some more milk then just gone for a walk for two hours at like 1000 at night just invented a reason to get out the house and be alone there must be people out there who if you didnt have slanking if you didnt have salah maybe even have johnson bench im sure theres going to be people out there who had rogers on the bench sorry not johnson rogers on the bench no salanki no salah and had fleen and saw that hall and saw the green arrow and was like thank god i got a player bringing something home and then sorry if thats you dear me anyway fleen four trent two gabrielle 2 porro one miserable in defense ino 3 and here it comes rogers nine johnson 8 salo 18 seeno chow was the captain of course seeno 10 harland two salanki 16 the fact that i played seeno over lewis raised a few eyebrows and of course raised suspicions of we got a leak i knew people think that the thing is i was on the train to notam i had no signal and i was like try to get a signal to message in whatsapp and say people are going to think this arent they when i just like all the team news was coming in and so on and i was like i was surprised that more people didnt play so many i was surprised how many teams did bench de bench him i was pretty shocked that i was he was such a differential because i always thought city would concede and then like whos most likely get the goal but what was funny one of the reasons i played him and this is i shouldnt be affected by this but i was on on friday night i was waiting for the embargo team news to come through and it came through from pep about ive got a few injuries so that spooked me a bit and i thought well we dont know who those injuries are and he said to like youll find out i was like brilliant thank you so i didnt think lewis would be injured but i thought that perhaps thered be more injuries and then city more likely to concede so i thought ill play some meno if theyre going to be weakened but the other thing that made me play him was there was a interview with him on bbc on the bbc website which i presume was on football focus and on it he talked about setting a goal target and when its just recency biased i watched it and thought hes a good player and he he could get fit and i was i was talking myself into playing him and thats that was played into it as well and its just weird out those little things like if you read an article or someone there someone just brings a player to mind you could be on twitter could you just bre through twitter and that could be the thing that just makes you go when its so close and it was like the difference between seeno rogers lewis when i looked and gabrielle when i looked at review because i was looking at review and they were all about between 3 four 37 expected points but when its like that its like well its down to me theres not theres not enough in it where the algor the model going to help so i just went on my biases which was well i dont trust pep and i think city will city will let one in at least and they let two in so two things on that firstly you could have given me the tip off that lewis was benched that would have been i didnt know he was bench did i of course you didnt you think im that im glad city wasnt the first kickoff because it would have been even worse wouldnt it imagine if we both bench lewis imagine if i had bench lewis for for davis would have got absolutely slated for being in the old cartel i wanted to ask say for example you had to play lewis this week because youve got no ged to say gabrielle was a was a d okay doesnt work with this example but say you were playing lewis this week would that make you less likely to want to play seeno what if i was playing lewis and seeno in the same it would because i hate that i hate so do i so that was the other factor it was like i was always going to play gabrielle over lewis because i felt the goal threat from gabrielle is far greater and i thought that e i thought well maybe arsenal will concede city will concede so its then go threat so its always gabrielle and i was pretty certain he was going to play gabrielle i dont think there was i dont think there was much doubt going into the game week that gabriel was going to start based on what wed heard and what arteta had said not that you can trust arteta but so it was never a choice between gabriel and lou it was always do i go three at the back or four at the back and bench seeno so its or leou thats the nine points that i lost out on my leaf days i just dont dont get why you weve le it was it which not likely to score is what were your think because i played him at home to everton and they lost 30 that was that was honestly that was the fixture right i should have i its not okay were on your team now we dont need to do the whole thing on lea davis but that is going to sting i think for a while that move but when i cant i cant so i just i cant believe pep said one player we cant rest is ric its funny everyone said didnt they in the week that means hes benched for sure i didnt think that i didnt think for one minute lewis wouldnt start it was just most likely get me some points but i was surprised how many played lewis and how many owned some meno i sold a lot of people sold seeno as well he was a mwe for palmer and so i was surprised he was such a differential when i got a signal and i finally flick in through teams i was like blame me s meno could work out and he did which was great so last a bit of luck he is the dominant player for them and its a good time to look at the ticker balmer fixtures now brenford brighton wolves those three in particular very strong from an attacking standpoint theyll probably concede but having seeno for those for that runs pretty good and it doesnt theyre fifth on the ticker here over the next 12 i say who impressed me that was kirz with a two he was cuz i had him i had him last season do you remember when everyone went for zabani and i was like ill take the punt on kirz thatll be fun misses out in the first double game week zabani scores and then they then they concede that was so you talk you talk about theres little things like kirkus i look at him think you let me down that time it wasnt even its not his fault he didnt get picked but i still look at him think that was that was your fault but i think kirk stats are good we going to talk about a bit later but hes another one four 43 is theres some decent options emerging around like the four the four fiveish bracket and the thing is its like no clean sheets but i think youve got to just consider the attack and return potential now theres no clean sheets anywhere no not even arsenal now as were were going to touch on its its now about which defenders are most likely to get you something in the in the attacking third because finding defenders who can get you clean sheet like in fact vardia was now described as the better option over lewis which is crazy because its like its leis is cheaper and so hes the cheaper route into the city defense but because all we care about is attacking returns because weve given up on clean sheets you go bario and its its weird it if like people saying now which city defender theyd say aio even though he cost more because lewis is only getting you clean sheets he might get assists youll probably get one goal maybe two over the season but v is unquestionably the more attacking of those two and now thats all we care about because was it two clean sheets for city and i dont think theyre coming anytime soon brighton spurs liverpool theyre not going to keep a clean sheet in any of them games i dont think no and is a problem with lewis because hes hes 47 48 hes his place is at risk each week i expect him to play most games but he will get the odd he will he will miss the od game when walker comes in he hasnt got as good attacking threat as some of the defenders around his priz and hes not keeping clean sheets as well so its the thing im playing him each week because hes a man city defender im trying to im thinking okay this is statistically one of the best defenders in the league and one of the best teams in the league and its im im losing out to players like leaf davis and eight nory and kirz and lewis hall and stuff who also arent getting clean sheets but have a bit more going forward hes becoming a troll he is like i look at him i probably will have to play him this week because i dont want to play rogers and field but maybe i should because city at brighton again i feel like theyre going to concede lewis probably isnt going to get an attack in return so what am i looking at a one or two point i might as well play rogers and roll the dice maybe but i dont know ill make up my mind later in the week maybe ill read an article about rogers and be convinced by that again but thats what it takes when its so close you just it is in a way you can when youre in my position well go against the eo and go well if the player with lower ownership go with that person but out of lewis and rogers theres not much in it is there so the one cave i would say on the strategy of going with what players are saying about themselves is dont forget nicholas bner who was the most arrogant if you went by purely by that hed be your captain every week because of how well he spoke about himself but the thing is seeno had a sausage dog as well and he was nice in the video and its stupid isnt it because you start thinking what a nice guy and hes got hes got a dog like mine and and then 10 minutes later the pep stuff comes out and then lo and behold im going now im going to start some menu and of course that must have fed into its so weird i dont know but it is it is youve got to be careful what you expose yourself to when youre looking at your fbl lineup because if youre on twitter too much or you read too much or you watch a video the biases come through dont they and you got to be aware of that and it could often go completely wrong the antithesis of harland for you who you dont feel dont speak so highly of i should have just stuck with my guns not gone on twitter and made up my own mind but the fomo was made worse by all the ferar about the hat tricks and everything you read about when i didnt have harland there was all this talk of him getting what 40 goals this year suddenly thats all evaporated no ones got him anymore im looking at everyones team everyone him and everyones talking about chris wood like all the pundits and everything chris woods getting all the attention about like isnt it marvelous how the oldfashioned number nine and suddenly the talk of harland has completely im keeping the fave wai in the good let look at this shows your am and he had sal god my i just realized look at my formatting on that disgraceful the ocd is kicking in ive jsky salers aligned to the right as is mine and your holland im should have corrected that never mind ignore that past cant see it lots of salah captains which surprises me i didnt realize that most of that way and three hars and i because it was harland who make w guess for most of these teams when i checked through teams as i do when deadline passes i look and see what other people have done a lot of people made the harland out to sell a move which paid off in the short term but its a big its a big commitment how do you feel about that now because youre looking at this youre probably one of the few managers along with myself who probably still got him i thought about it i thought about doing harland out for sou harland i think it was harland and as well as the salanki to himz move it was going to be harland and because ive got dibling to salah and himz i think it was i was determined to get himz one way or the other and glad i didnt but i think it i would have i would have about broken even on it because although salah would have come in and got the goals i would have benched rogers who scored so and then with the hit i dont think there was a huge amount in in not doing it i thought about doing it this week again not for himz this time but for kuna but as a spoiler im im not doing that so im going to be going another week without salah in my team but i i expected it to be more split i expected there to be more i know this isnt just all the people that have sold sal im sure theres people here who have got salah and harland as well but when i was doing my check of all the managers around us did you do that as well believe absolutely i couldnt i couldnt quite believe how many how many people had sold him do you have an order who do you have an order of whose teams you look at first of course because you do judge like i dont think its a good thing i dont think its very healthy but you do judge yourself by what other people have done how theyre doing i know im im pretty sure people like ben krin and general dont do this at all because theyre stronger mentally and think that probably affects them and it and theyre probably right theyre definitely right but i always do that when deadline passes i look at what youve done what andys done what late ris has done what slippers has done what raptor i look at his team theres probably about a dozen managers i look at and you like compare your players to their who go hes got him but ive got him and then hes got him and ive got him that can a little bit a little bit im more interested in what transfers theyve made because i dont watch the deadline streams so its its i dont know what is done and things like that so i always like to have a look but its i dont know how healthy that is to compare yourself confirmation bias of b the kid i think i think a lot of it is if people are making similar moves to you it feels quite good it was interesting though because i looked at all the sellar outs and all the harland outs are in and the sells in and i still just feel that theres not enough in it between seller and harand for me to think that hes 100 the way to go i know ss been like unreal and unbelievable but i still find it crazy the points harlands got over the last two weeks and all we can do is forward tell me about it and i dont know i look i look at i look at brighton i look at spurs and i look at salah with villa and and southampton and i think i dont know i dont know whos going to win out in that a people will say its going to be salah but i dont think its that its that clear cut to me i wouldnt i wouldnt be at allall surprised if har came back race against follow no question theres not a massive gap between them but there is a gap in the money thats fact right so its like what can you do with that difference in funds i think also what is facted is city arent in a as good a place as liverpool so thats fact as well right so thats i think on a level playing field salo and harland is not a lot in it and arguably harand sealing is higher i think it is but at the moment poor in this groove of winning matches and salahs just doing what he always does like cu i ive had periods where i havent owned him and you watch him you think when hes not playing well im going to get away with this and then he goes and gets a penalty or goes and gets a couple of assists at the end or gets a late goal and you think hes come out with a nine 10 point return out of what was a poor performance and harlands capable of doing that as well but normally with harland its like its signposted he doesnt normally sneak of a turn its like within the first 20 minutes and youre like god this is going to go bad exactly where salah could just turn it like thats the difference and thats the player he is its true it feels to me though that once hollands gone i feel like thats him gone i dont see how you can weve all used the wild cards or most of have used the wild cards so if youre selling him for salah and okay theres midfields with salah sacker and palmer which look like unbelievable and im seeing some amazing teams out there without harland but what do what are you going to do if you want harlem back and the answer to that is nothing right because youre not going to move youre not if youre if youre taking the harlem money and youre putting it around your team and youre putting into those three assets in midfield i dont see how theres ever going to be a point in which you say okay i dont want salah anymore i dont want palmer anymore im going to move back to harland so youre youre done with him right thats thats how i see it until the wild card i agree i dont think youre getting him back with three transfers no because you have to spread the funds the only point in getting hland out of your team is to spread the funds and hope that makes the difference and in a world in a landscape where we have got palmer saaka son salah and as we said last week a cast of forwards who are doing their job and getting maximum bonus from one goal spreading the funds should compensate should i would say but its the recency bias again isnt it of weve just come off harlands most miserable run in his premier league career for city one goal in five hes i dont think hes done that before if the under if the underlyings were like the same as they had been against newcastle and wolves id be in a very different place and again maybe this is where stats we focus too much on stats so maybe he just isnt a poor era of confidence and hes not going to score but hes getting hes getting so many chances still im h im happy im happy to keep him and see him battle out against the seller the seller owners but theyre both great picks those of good comments coming in that isnt one of them l because hes agreeing with you thanks i love this later on though this is this is from flimy joy bassel bank great name this is like go back to the scout cast hes put a rough with the smoth in look rough b in salah but after too much drinking i forgot to confirm my squad so he sat my my god no sat on the bench the move for fimy was rogers started in place that is a smoth same points same point exactly it is did did he captain well he probably captain somebody else but some lovely stuff coming in and swat saying dont forget to like a lot of people agreeing with you triggers in the chat saying he thinks its easy to buy harand back it is its two transfers i think its a mental thing though is its that its that mental block in terms of youve done the effort to get harland out youve spread the funds and then to almost go back to him feels like youre turning a sea tanker isnt its like i dont i dont agree i dont think back because i think if you if the easiest way to buying back would be to sell salah and i dont see when youre going to sell salah even if he blanked in the next three games which he wont but even if he did it still be like its still seller playing for liverpool hed have to go completely off the rails in the next five or six so to get harand you have to sell one of sacka or palmer youre not going to sell one of sakur or palmer with the run theyve got cuz the fixures are unbelievable youre not going to sell palmer before like home game against wolves or whoever theyre playing are you look sacker before west ham its this is the going to happen were going back to the ticker and the two teams top now this is the blackbox ratings by the way not the default ratings on scout scouts ratings are great but i like to tweak it a bit make forest a bit more difficult lets face it that is a harder game than scout right theyre not bright red theyre a bit less blue but chelsea and arsenal are top of the ticket over the next 12 chelsea got ar they got each other this week but after that they both got a fantastic run of fixtures and city ar far down the ticker but its the next three for city plus if you look at this run for city weve said it before brighton away spurs liverpool forest palace united villa out of that run of eight fixtures seven fixtures right the only game that i would say is straightforward unless i dont think united will be now because amarin the new manager first derby its got to be more difficult for city youd think the only fixure there i would say that city will win maybe easily is palace away but cellers parkss a difficult place to go and by the time by the time they get there in game week 15 glasa might have sorted them out and made them hard to beat at home so i look at that and just i dont think theres an easy game there forest at home would be in a couple of seasons go but i dont think it will be for i look at i watched city last night against sportting i thought if we played for city tomorrow i re and forest have a good chance because we are incredibly hard to break down and incredibly good on the counterattack and i watched city and thought they havent got many ideas at the moment they needed de bry are on the pitch because they just quite predictable they are predict and theyre light in midfield like the team you can play it you can play out against them pretty easily and cut through the defense thats like kovic in that holding role just doesnt work for me and lewis or walker at right back theyre all good players theyre all good players and theyre all capable of a bit of magic on the but i would think looking at this brighton are going to fancy it spurs are going to fancy it liverpool are definitely going to fancy it and unless de bru is fully fit and harlands firing again i think forest will go to the ead with the best chance of getting something theyve had since theyve come up no question no question at all so i dont think an easy game there for them im im im giving haren the next two brighton and spurs i think i probably will sell him ahead of liverpool away because i could move him down to salah whos whos hes got the home game or over to sacka whos got west ham which i like ar arsenal havt exactly been great arsenal last night were pretty dire they had a lot of the ball but again it was predictable there a lot of crosses to a center forward who doesnt exist j jezus came on and couldnt generate much from that sacka was double teamed all the time and was frustrated and couldnt martin n is not offering enough down that side and od guards not there odard cominging back well talk about it late is huge absolutely huge and so weve got odard and de coming back into these two teams it could make the world a difference lets look at some data though lets start because were probably going to run on to three hours otherwise but good chat good chat so far lovely comments as well coming in so its good defense for the season a few things i want to mention here and its not forest villa what did you make of the 41 at spurs when defensive dat theyre four feir 099 xg conceded non penalty per 90 and they were second i think on this table going into the spurs game theyve slipped down now its crazy isnt it i dont know whats going on with villa they seem both frustrating as a defensive unit even though the data is good and a little bit limited in attack i look at watkins and hes only had more than two shots in one game all season wow thats a hell of a stat that is i had a look in most games hes getting one or two shots but hes only had three in one fixture so far and he needs the watkins of old needs volume like hes a better player now and hes better at taking his chances but my preconception of watkins before last season was where hes going to need five or six chances to score i dont know if hes a striker who with if he only had two shots in the game could get the numbers he got last season what do you think about that when i watch villa i think when theyre on song and its and its clicking between biley rogers duran watkins theyve got like ramsey coming on t theyve got players who when they link up and play well it looks vibrant and its attacking football and quick like transitions across the pitch looks good but theres been quite there been a couple of games now where you watch them and it just looks a bit laborious it looks a bit slow and that was happening against spurs and then when villa scored from the set piece i thought well thats thats it now like this is happened to spurs so many times they been in complete control conceded the goal and now theyre going to fall apart and they didnt they just they just carried on doing what they were doing before and once they got one it was just a matter of time before villa crumbled because they werent offering no anything when wers went off they were like just limp i dont know what hes so key hes so key to them morgan rogers its unbelievable didnt didnt see that i thought hed be a good pick for us at 5m but i didnt think hed be like the talis almost the talisman of the team after 10 weeks dont know whats missing i dont know what it maybe its lewis has left and he was a big figure last season anal has come in and hes perhaps not as mobile hes not as dynamic with the ball and theyve missed lewiss set pieces because that was a big factor he was he was a master of those wasnt he mcin seems less of influence biley definitely is the fullbacks definitely are as well rogers and watkins have looked okay but theyve looked like their partnership is absolutely key if thats not on song theyre struggling its its weird theres a lot of teams in that bracket i would say is when they sold dougas louise i thought this might be the problem theyd have because he was that eight role who box the box just linked everything so well they signed anana and i thought okay anas more defensive at least he has been a everton and then when he signed he started getting them the goals in the first couple of weeks i was thinking they want something here theyve made a like for like placement with a player that i didnt expect but i do wonder if now they just they just seem to be missing that energy like in the midfield between the defense and the attack which louise gave him so well and that ability with him to pass the ball he his passing was unreal last season he could pick a ball out from from right across the havent got anyone thats looking up and trying to put a ball over the top so much like watkins isnt getting as many i thought villa against spurs watkins would be thr on goal like over and over and over again without there but it just didnt seem to happen and spurs played well i thought drasin played well in that game but i didnt feel like they tested them that often by trying to put those balls over the top and trying to get watkins involved and i was surprised at that cu i thought that was probably their best their best weapon matt saying its all about fixtures it is but lets have a look at their fixtures if you look at the short term theyre theyre pretty bad liverpool away palace at home chelsea away its all about the home games palace brenford sampton youd think that they would im certainly brenford and sampton and youre gna youre going to hold rogers probably for those two but the away games are tough for them so its theyre one of those teams that have got fixtures that are on off on off on off theres no sustained spell other than those two bren that brenford santon over a longer period theyre right down there like over the 12 theyre third from bottom so it i also think as well lo losing to club bruge was that tyro mings picking the ball up and giving a penalty thats a bad result for them because they were flying through that and coasting and now that palace game looks good the one sandwiched in between chelsea and liverpool but then theyve got juventus after that palace game so youve got to think watkins isnt going to see 90 minutes in that game they might even take rogers off early in that they play brenford and southampton back to back but after southampton which is arguably the best game you can have this season they then go away to red bull leig and juventus will be an interesting game because if they lose that game to juventus and then theyve got to go away to red bull li theres suddenly going to be a lot of pressure on them to get a result in that match so again we talked about jackson before and how hes starting every game and watkins and the duran threat but there could be more rotation coming i think particularly over this period because of though the import if theyd beaten club brouge i think that it might have eased it a little bit but losing one nil was wasnt a game i dont think they could afford to lose its 8 nil chelsea at the moment 8 n my god first team out i know the other thing i want to say about villa is jan right and when rogers went off it was interesting never talk of an injury but he didnt want to go off and emory said interestingly i dont think the injury is too bad because he didnt want to come off but i wanted to get i wanted to get two forwards on ive got thoughts on it does make me wonder that because jan is there and hes like on a leash and hes proving himself and he wants to get starts as soon as theres an opportunity to get him on the pitch emorys is like ill take that because in the back of his mind hes thinking if as soon as theres a window where i should consider putting jan on im going to take it so as soon as rogers got a knock but hes off get emory get jan on and itll be the same for watkins as well like so that is a thing when youre take when if youre owning watkins and rogers if they get with 20 minutes to go there is no question theyre coming off because hes looking for a chance to get duran in on the pitch to keep him appeased now maybe thats speculative but thats how it seemed to me in that game because i dont think i think rogers could have stayed on and they might have done better my thoughts on morgan roggers in that game and im a big morgan rogers fan dont get me wrong because i takes of a pinch of salt but dont complain about getting subbed off if youre going to spend 5 minutes rolling around on the floor okay crying in pain and then your manager subs you off and you go what are you doing im fine dont roll around then just get up get on with it if youre fine get up you think hed know you think you think watkins and rogers go on thinking durans gonna come on with 15 20 minutes to go so let me let me make sure i dont give em a chance ive never ive never ive never seen like it cuz like so when son got subbed he was he looked good he was running around and he was like what are you doing r just got subbed and did the same reaction youve been rolling on the floor for 5 minutes man lets move on city slipped down here chances per 976 which is extraordinary clean sheet slow as we said we talked about lewis andard already united the big chances is the highest though so when they are getting a chance its 23 big chances conceded per 90 palace have got three theyre city are certainly the biggest in the top 10 arent they other than bournemouth so they are conceding the wider big open chances yes and arsenal have slipped down and suddenly liverpool and forest are the two best defenses 81 089 dont laugh united what you make united because with the new manager amarin coming in the talk is all about bruno and well talk about bruno in a bit any anything making you think maybe we should reconsider the defense cuz its its 14th here so this would cons this would say no but theyve had the most clean sheets have they this season theyve done second most one at one point theyd had the most i dont thats thats continued but i think i think it might beings must bep four clean sheets liverpool got five liverpool got six i believe for they were at one point they the most but now its now its okay now theyre third but still its its not bad i am getting swept up in the amarim hype you are already are you i am i cant help it you watch that performance that they put in against city and you see the way hes got them playing and if you watch monday night football as well you saw some of the stats that hes bought into to sporting this is the bias i was talking about with some if you watch too much of this you get youre going to end up buying gar you got it too late that was before as well youre so vulnerable i know but like top for progressive carries top for bl shots top for xg top for goals all the things and okay its what cara described as a league enough just a bit but and man utd arent arent one of the top teams in the league so its going to be a difference but i think it is exciting i think ive been watching a lot of like tactics videos about him were going to do a bit on am him in a bit but its its going to be to see whether he comes in and tries to stamp the the three the back formation the wing backs the three rotating sing side forwards all play or whether he keeps going with what ruds rud then t been doing so i dont i think you if youre going to if youre going to buy into it you have to buy into it now because of the next three pictures its got to be the attack lad rather than the defense i would have thought well look at well look at it in a bit its interesting because you said about when you watch tactics thing i think it does affect you before the season started i did a lot of work on moresco and slot and i looked into slots tactics if you remember i showed formations on here didnt i and i thought out of that i thought this is could have influenced me and it did cuz what i did well there was two things i could have done i could have gone diaz cuz i was convinced that one of the wingers was going to be more inverted than the other and i thought it would be diaz with salah staying wide and that is what weve seen so i could have gone diaz that would have worked out well i didnt go df did i went bloody quono instead you got it right for 45 minutes i got it right for 4 cuz i went ill go qu cuz hes going to play and hes a four million defender and hes definitely going to prefer the ball playing defender cuz thats how slot likes to play so rather than take the diaz lesson which would have been marvelous cuz he got like five goals in the first three or four game weeks i went for bloody quono which last his 45 minutes im so gutted i know you it does affect you doesnt it when youve when you think youre on to summit i go im gonna go for that so you got to be careful gotta be careful but you were you were right to go for it you just went for the wrong one of the of the of the two options you call liverpool being a a good team but a more functional team a less chaotic al then again coming from klopp it was always going to be a slightly less chaotic team but i dont think i can claim that saying liverpool a good team is that much of a grand move i but i think i was expecting more of a more of a drop off from them than weve seen i thought it was a big job to replace such a legend in club and i thought there might be a bit of adjustment period or a bit of time to take but theyve been absolutely unreal outstanding top of the defense not top of attack because spurs at top of the attack and i dont think that is surprising given what we saw against villa and it is the basis on which ive gone fre spurs hoping that would get returns its surprised that he chelsea up there but then they banged in eight tonight and that explains why palmer from game rout 12 is such a priority what is surprising is arsenal i think theyre not the best defense now thats been carrying them theyre like four in the defensive data based on xg on penalty conceded theyre down in six here 158 behind united liverpool chelsea city and spurs but od guards back and that could unlock them right i hope that does i hope the handbreak comes off a bit and hav herz and sacka become im not scared of havs and sacka at the moment for me though thats that the difference is odard i just i just think there completely different team to judge when theyve got him in the side and when they havent cuz when you look at the front three when you look at the midfield three of what marino rice and well part has been playing at right back for a bit hasnt he played midfield last night its been hav havit have been dropping in isnt he to the eight and its just theres just no theres no creativity there is theres nothing theres no one that can unlock defenses in that midfield three they and martinelli dont bring enough to the party do they they and theyve both been poor theyve both been poor this season they were last jayus if i was if i was playing against arsenal and i saw martinelli trossard and gabriel jayus in the side i wouldnt be filled with fear like theyre good theyre good players but theyre not league winning theyre squad players in my opinion and then you look at that midfield fre and you think well who in that midfield rice is going to run around and do a great job and hes got a lot of talent dont get me wrong 80m pound player he runs around a bit but hes not whos whos going to be the person to play that killer ball through and if they do play the killer ball through whos whos getting on the end of it i dont they ring theyre relying so much on sacka and you can hes not easy to shut down lets face it hes getting harder by the season to shut down but you can they did a good job on him last night and it showed how you could restrict them when you do that and theyre desperate to get odard back theres no question and i think i would then expect them to climb this table and weve said if you look at the long ticker theyre right up there for the fixtures and from game 12 onwards or maybe 13 west ham away thats where you got to get on them i think again theres a brilliant comment in the chat if you could if you could flag out from no weak foot just saying they need smith row that what that is that is exactly who they need well he would have played wouldnt he would have played i think he would have played i think i think hed be starting i think hed be starting the matches that odard was out if they had him in because they havent got another player that can drive with the ball like he does and play a ball through to some of these forwards and wingers i think theyre it doesnt surprise me at all to see arsenal sick on this list because i just i think theyre quite i think theyre quite ordinary at the moment but we expect them to pick up and we expect them to climb his table again and threaten united attack is up there we talked about the defense does the presence of them fing this table 160 before amarin gets there does that make you even more tempted to go all in well the issue the issue the issue isnt so much the stat this year is the lack of goal i think theyre 18th for goals lack of goals this season or like that and again you look at the team and think where the goals going to come from because holand isnt i dont think hollands a 20 25 goal a season striker rashford hasnt been on it for ages garnacho is wasteful you could argue amad deserves to start but hes i think hes got a couple tonight but id be probably more surprised than not if he if he started the weekend so where the goals coming from are the goals going to come from fernandez is he going to l step up well he hasnt scored more than 10 goals in his last three years is he maybe im completely wrong with that but definitely id be surprised if hes i can tell getting more than that you go there you go you go thats go bang on bang on 10 goals in bang on 10 goals thats his premier league career so his best season 32 returns 2021 when we were talking about him being the new king of fbl even over salo at that point god its not great is it and its been its been deed since 19 goal returns last season though 34 of the goal involvement hes on 33 goal involvement this season because united have been so poor at scoring goals hes only had three returns but that three returns is enough to get him a third of the my god it just shows you doesnt it how theyve struggled because theyve only scored theyve only scored nine goals and which i think its southampton has scored fewer so amarin has got a bit of a bl canvas but hes got a lot to do isnt he and brunos got to be the player that lets have a look at lets have a look at uniteds cast here zi we can we can count out on the grounds that hes put on some timber apparently acc report apparently hes hes a stone heavier than he should be according to v tenar when he left your man gun atos up there in terms of points per xg i non penalty per 52 just ahead of bruno and gacher is the more palatable if youre going to go anywhere because its 63 compared to 82 for me though its about losing a midfield slot to united player im not sure im ready for that im okay im okay with v next three this is the thing because there is no better fixtures than lester rip switch and everton if you were to pick three fixtures it would be those two maybe west ham would be one of them but definitely or south hampton if you had all three pr teams in a row in terms of in terms of a three i think thats thats excellent the question is if amam comes in doesnt matter what tactics he brings in doesnt matter what formation he changes what players he brings off the bench or whatever there isnt players in the team who can score goals hes got to change that mentality and hes got to get them scoring and i look at that cast that youve got on there and whos going to fly in that who is who is going to be the one that steps up and starts banging in the goals theres a lot on brunos got to get 10 goals again if you go back at these numbers he got 10 goals last season 10 in 2122 hes got to hit double figures again hasnt he because i dont i think youre absolutely right you look at this and think im not sure gacho can holand might be able to if he trans to me hs the one though holand is the one that needs to step up because hes the only nine in that team xery isnt isnt good enough this season i dont think hes going to need time hes more of a link player isnt hes not hes not an out his reputation isnt that of a goal scorer necessarily they cant s rashford up front because that doesnt work they tried that they tried that every year and it doesnt work so do try it every year its only highlands there that can do it so he needs to start scoring more regularly has to i me hes got it in him but i just think hes still one maybe even two seasons away from his peak well he is need to st need to stay fit need to have a prolong period without in injury but i think its youre right i think its its not just tactics and formation its mentality if you look at we look at this amarins going to turn up and we think hes going to favor a 3421 and these both these images are both courtesy of skys recent article by the way which ive in danger of being biased by reading that but im not im not going to go all in on united as might be open to persuasion but i dont know how quickly hes going to move to this whether hell land and go right three at the back wing backs will he will he do that do you think or will it take time cuz i was looking at like predicted lineups for manest united if they if they switch this formation and they have three good center backs for this formation in yoro martinez and delit well yoro isnt fit and hes 18 years old so i dont see how he can play delict and maguire in a back three the teams are going to eat that up for breakfast ar thats martinez carrying a lot then in that so i dont think he can go to a back three if its until yos yos back theyve got ma do for the wing back slots and sure if hes if hes ever fit they could also play gono at left wing back i was going to ask whether you think hes going to end up at wing back he could do is interesting because he tends to be the right wing back thats the more attacking one and thats thats what the graphic thats what the graphic shows here sporting average positions under ammer in its its right hand side thats where is the more attacking side so thats dow thats got to be thats got to be dow i would have thought mazra is a good player but if youre and it could be fernandez if youre going to bring in the most attacking for wing back is its going to be dow on that side i dont know if gacho is totally suited for a left wing back role is unless youre just telling him to stay past the halfway line his work rate isnt no isnt the best is it well if hes going to end up there teams are going to target that arent they teams i would i would no question my cameras gone off no question at all that they would target that but i its its the right side midfield behind the forward which will be holand which is interested thats where we think bruno is going to play right it has to be it has to it has to be bruno because the two center mids have got to do so much running and youve got to think thats going to be mayo and agat right because that is thats what they do thats like the roll in the so they seem perfect for this system in the midfield and bruno seems perfect in one of those inside forward spots i think when united have got like a fully fit team i think it works because youve got martinez deck and and yoro youve got shaw on the left youve got dallow on the right ugat and casir is just out isnt he ugat and and mayu and then youve got fernandez rashford and hland that works but if you take a couple of those players out through injury or whatever suddenly i dont think the system they havent got the squad to i dont know to keep to keep the momentum or to make changes i dont i just dont see how he how he brings this in straight away and implements it he needs players i think he needs time and i dont think he goes to this straight away you have no sound mark what have you done i was so well sorry i was interrupting you anyway i muted to get my camera back on he needs a transfer window doesnt he he does i think so i think that hes one or two key players from this formation i dont i dont think hes got enough deb foot win back to play this week in week out he hasnt got that center back like you say thats fit and i dont know if rashford and bruno are going to play behind the striker in those rols bruno definitely can rashford it could it could be amad like a few like a few people are saying but thats a big step up it just feels like to wear pegs to me it does a little bit a little bit considering the pressure hell be under to get results i think hell rethink it and stay with the four at the back initially and then do what he see what he can do in january basic thats way hell go all right lets look at the regular stats of players not too much to talk about as always other than the fact that you take allison out the equation because hes injured on his way back ss is the best keeper now in terms of points per 90 48 which is crazy you ruined him for everyone i blame you entirely i not good enough just didnt see it at all but hes been outstanding four clean sheets but been bring in some saves and bonus as well wanted to talk about onana here cuz he done well with the four clean sheets of mention and that could be if you want to go united im sure united fans are itching to get more players in and nana could be a logical step because he has done well even under tag so youd think there could be an improvement under amarin as well fleen weve already talked about so theres theres not too much movement here other than i think that reyya will come again i think with the fixtures weve seen given where arsenal are on the ticker and from game 13 onwards i dont think forest at home is an easy game but i dont it could be a clean sheet i dont know about you but i do expect to want to move back to two arsenal defenders from about from 12 13 ors are you thinking ive got them ive got two ive still got ry ive got ive got gabrielle its been a rough ride up until now but i look at that run forest west ham man utd fulham everton palace ipswitch brenford 12 right till 19 thats what eight games its easy to say isnt it youd expect three or four clean sheets minimum from those if i was picking a goalkeeper from gw 12 it would be ryer so im happy to im happy to have him i think that when i move harland out some of the money that is cleared will be to try and move back to two arsenal defenders you wont keep i find it hes done all right for me hes got a couple of falls so hes got hes had a couple to be fair he has he has but i dont want to take him beyond like this is with good fixtures as well it was interesting though to watch brenford atam and they said that they spoke to frank before the game and they said would you take a one nil or 43 what you prefer he goes always a 43 and then his team put on the most flaccid performance ive seen for some time right well it was it was ridiculous wasnt it was like were were won that up thats just it cooper it was i couldnt believe i couldnt believe i was watching of all the teams of all the managers to put in performance like that i could not believe it was it was brenford it was ridiculous it was like 45 shots was it to like four it was it ando was just nothing he was more fullback than a winger wasnt he he played down the middle come it was strange so i do wonder whether frank is suddenly going what im tired of the four threes and lets go but because they were once a side that were built on a bit of discipline at the back set pieces when they first came up thats how they build thats thats what you do when you get promoted its what forest did you have to grind out results they became a bit more of a flare team who scored goals this season and played a different style of football which just left them open i do wonder if hes like time to move the dial back but he doesnt want to admit that be interesting but theres no doubt find the middle ground you dont you dont need to be up there or bloody on the bottom find a nice middle ground you got to attack fulham a little bit i dont agree with sexy b saying is rough two world is an injury time i dont think it was rough at all i think it was completely deserved completely deserved that f and won that game they didnt brenford here 15th for the defensive weight data 171 they did have a tough start but theyve had good fixtures recently remind me what their fixtures are like short long term theyre pretty bad now so theyve got these three ever leer then it falls off a cliff right theres no way im taking fle into that one it will be saves gore but villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton ars theyre not theyre not getting anything from thems getting a 50 pointer in one of those games a one nil a one nil against chelsea away wheres the clean sheet coming there villa newcastle chelsea forest but hell do it to sp because thats what thats what these players love to do they love to spite us im even looking in buo and thinking i dont know if i want him over that run no ill be selling hes hes too highly owned i think to keep and thats thats thats pure black box that is too highly owned to keep too highly owned to hes boring isnt he everyones got him you dont even get you dont even celebrate his points when they when they come in villa newcastle chelsea forest brighton arsenal nah we can do better in midfield i think over that certainly be sing the analytics crew will be shouting skill issue at you now i saying that and me for saying it as well hes on pens 90 minute man ever present perfect algorithms absolutely love him regardless of fixtures but i think youre right i think that if youre trying to push up trying to push towards 100k which is what weve got to be aiming for you perhaps have to roll the dice against inmo for that run because its dismal theres no question y the question is where you go but we can cross that bridge when we get to midfield in a minute i dont want to talk too much about tread because we did that last week but simas he is he is now the starter and hes third in this table 026 which theres a whole gaggle of defenders around that 02 bracket trent out on top 036 so above them but only just its not a huge margin and with the it test as weve seen simic talk to me about him 4 six taking set pieces has that more quality than robertson i would say in terms of delivery and in terms of xgi outperformed trent in that game last weekend i think he came out 056 and trent if i remember the walkout video was about 015 dismal like that so simcast definitely can offer us something how close now are you is it week by week were getting closer to letting trent go how close are you sim is on my wall there on side after the after the bench boost last year so a big fan i dont necessarily think hes a step up from robertson i think he is this season because robertson has declined in a lot of areas because hes getting on a bit and fair enough i dont feel like sim is like a new signing whos a great left back necessarily i think hes a squad player who has been thrust into the role because robertson has gone down i wonder if theyre going to move in january for a new left back and man utd are going to be moving for a new left back as well its a very popular england dont even have a left back so its its a its a highly sought after position with not too many options available so be see what they what they do trent like you said i think we need to talk about trent a little bit because again i dont think the run of fixtures liverpool have got lends themselves so well to clean sheets coming forward i think after that southampton game its what everton its newcastle its man city as well and its going to be hard for him to justify 7m unless hes getting more regular returns attacking wise because theres so many defenders who are getting good attacking returns would i move trent to simas not a chance you would not a chance youre just youre just i would go anywhere near simas i just dont think robertson comes in every now and then and plays gomez can play on the left as well cant he could come in for a game i dont think simas is like too far ahead of either of them so avoid for me okay and you im look at liverpools fixtures theyre not great i dont believe theyre okay theyve got that city newcastle 134 which is tough way im looking at this thinking wheres the clean sheets coming from here villa i think they can keep a clean sheet against villa they certainly can against sampton but after that i think the next three or four very tough because theyve got city newcastle everton and spurs they can go a good as some part plenty teams can but its a bit different when its a spicy derby isnt it even calv louis might score in that one but i think i think theres clean sheets there for sure but in a world where those fixtures are tougher the problem with trent is i just i want it to happen i want that game to happen where he just gets those couple of attacking returns and everyone goes ah i do need him i do need him after all well hopefully its going to be one of the next two because its filler and southampton and then its the poor run if were selling harland and were selling trent where the hells all our money going its true kogo you think that min is going to come back in dont you dont think that role on the right side in front of elmans going to be his you think he what moves back to left back at that point then do you im very surprised hes been he started so many on the wing because gruda is there as well whos very highly rated hz said he was excited to work with him but clearly hasnt hasnt done that i wonder if maybe r could move over to the right now we got pedro coming back and oreillys back in the squad too so and ms back in training so i cant see any world in which kyogo carries on a right wing theres too many options that can come in look out for o al by the way hes hes absolute quality i saw you tweet today about well theres a number of players who can play the 10 it wont take long before oreilly gets the 10 and its and its his in my book i think hes well then the question where do pro then where does pedro play its its a problem because i think oreilly is going to be a starter very quickly because i just think hes exactly what you need for me hes so technically good hes a scorer of goals and a creator i think we need a pascal gr we need a pascal in that 10 hes not as consistent as gross so and he has been in a weaker league so lets see how he adjusts theres no question but hes got all the tools so i would have thought that he will end up being your 10 by the end of the season just how quickly he goes in i dont think hes going to be a fantasy asset not yet he could be next season though so c gl said no not much going there well whoa well i dont i dont i dont think he is a no i just think if youre expecting him to start on the wing again youre probably unlikely i still think with brightons fixtures after c i was gonna say even are strong right even if he plays at left back i think hes a good option i think hes starting to adjust to the league now i think hes first choice i think he plays every game i think hes hes the best defender weve got and the best one of the best players in the squad now he was signed of a massive reputation and were starting to see that coming through i would expect some clean sheets over the run of southampton fulham leicester palace west ham so you go you go over you go cadog over dunk or barco would you very good i still think barco could come good at some point but sorry im joking id go id go kogu dunk was dunk was interesting at the start of the season because we thought the set piece threat would be there but hasnt materialized i think kloo is the one hes a bit riskier than dunk but he offers a bit more okay okay i put some chelsea defenders at the end of the table here none of them featur in the top 30 well they dont its not they dont but chelseas fixtures are very strong and were all about parmer from the attack as well we havent touched on sanchez as an option any chelsea defenders tempted you at all i think its interesting reese james coming back what you make of that not going in for reese no hes not he doesnt look the same player at the moment is he hes trying to build fitness up but he looks like it might take him a little while to get going gusto is the one thats maybe more impressive because hes inverting a bit a bit more and getting forward but i wonder if thats going to carry on maybe when james is back to his best he go moves back to right back they got i dont see i think its going to be inversion on the other side its its just whether karella takes gustos minutes away thats the thing and he could because karella is more natural perhaps in that role i just dont theres just not a lot to like is there about the defense they con see goals they theres theres like rotation around those more attacking spots youre not going to go for cwi or for far cuz theres much more attacking options for the same price hard aoid and the thing is as well like we said it didnt we earlier in the show its like there were four fives like davis like eight nori who offer you a bit more in attack and gusto and karella cant even though theyre inverted they cant compete with that they need the clean sheets if chelsea suddenly turn into like a defensive juggernaut then maybe we can consider them but maybe i just i just cant see it fair enough midfield then lets look at that the bos top which for ages has not been worth a mention but hes coming back and it was interesting to see him i dont cant work out what pep was doing last night that night wasnt last night before wasnt it 41 down they go 31 down and n gallagher expert co comor that he is was calling out for he was he was doing cooms did you see that no gallagher no he was doing no he was doing he was doing co coms with dan fletcher and i cant remember who was on with fletch but it was it was no g gone i know so they had they had a shamelessly saying were going to have a fan of one of the teams as a co commentator ive never seen that and he was saying promoting the tour and stuff he probably gave him a lot of money about ive never cuz he kept saying we he kept saying were this and were that great its great isnt it when a when a co commentator is so unbiased but no gallagher was saying this games crying out for kevin he was thats the other thing he was doing hes calling players by their first name because who does that yes as if no gallagher gets to wander into the city dressing room when he likes to have drink well he probably does so fair enough but yes i know what youre getting out there but he was he was saying brennan he was saying this games crying out for kevin at 31 down and he was right i was like well they need a bit of invention maybe kevin can come on see im doing it now he can come on and turn it no he doesnt bring it him on then so we were like thinking well he cant be fit then can he cant if hes not coming on now hes not going to come on he cant be fit hes on the bench to make up the numbers they go 41 down with five minutes of stoppage time to go and pep goes come on kev on you come whats that about hes just come back from injury the games gone theres five minutes left game gone youre right why would you put de boy on i just i know that im not pep none of us are pep and i know hes a genius but even luke i think would struggle to work out what pep was thinking there with the game finished and with five minutes to go thats when you go ill tell you what kevs been out for months but they stick him on see how he does in the last five minutes very strange decision but it was it was also strange that he was on the bench for bournemouth and they were 21 down desperate for a goal and they dont bring him on in that game is like whats the point of him even being on the bench in that point of him being on the bench in either of those games youve got to think that its it is a numbers thing rather than name three keepers theyre putting de bruyer on and then if theyre desperate they bring him on and i get it but why bring him on when youre 41 down in a game that theyre not knocked out as a result of losing that game so why try and hes not going to turn it around is he in five minutes the only thing i can think of is hes trying to give de bruyne like a psychological lift that hes been out for a while and now hes gets to come back and feel the grass under his feet and hear the crowd and all thats but that is clutching thats all ive got imagine someone gone through him and hes out for the season just because of that five surely you i dont know who am i to question pep but i thought it was odd well he done it before with de bry didnt he de bry was out for the whole preseason and then he chucked him into that first game was it last year or maybe the year before and then he was out for like four months and then pep was like i probably shouldnt have played him in that game he wasnt ready whyd you do it then anyway what you make of that impact on thoden we expect it to help harland because deyne is elite when it comes to creating chances theres no theres no one in the league like him thats why hes top of his table do you i cant see foden operating out wide and bernardo silva starts so surely de brer back means fod and becomes more of a question mark right is a strange one because i cant see a world where foden gets a prolonged period of time out of the team because of do you not his quality well no because hes hes just hes just one player of the season and he in the games ive seen even the last few hes hes hes hes hes hes been very influential in the last couple of games i know they havent won but he scored the goal against sporting he had a good game i thought against bournemouth created loads of opportunities in that created like what four big chances in the game against southampton as well the issue is like you say is where you playing because theyve got savio on the right who i think is excellent foden we know from last year worked best with walker bobbing past him so he could tuck into the middle not going to get that so much with lewis so does he play in its him and de bruyne in midfield but then they havent got the wheres berard going then but the trouble is they havent got the they havent got the cover cuz its all right to do that when youve got rod doing the work all the dirty work behind you they have to play gundan and cover have to play dont they i dont think i dont think gans been good at all since hes come back from barcelona so i think theyve got a real its obvious to say theyre missing rodri but when the replacements arent stepping up its a big problem and youre right i bernardo would move over to the left but then theyve got nunes there as well havent they i dont know i think it is a problem for foden ive got ive got one more week with him i think he against brighton hes got a good record against us as well but then i think he is an issue but i dont see how he can not play him but then i dont see how he can play consistently i think de bruy just doesnt play every game i know i think i think if youre gna play de brer its going to be in europe and its going to be the tougher teams its going to be the games that you wont fow them in the easier fixures i think were still going to get that but its going to be interesting mojo saying i dont hes trying to give him some minutes and a done game whats weird about that cuz it was a stoppage time it was the injury time he brought him on for 5 minutes isnt going to benefit ala did it with oard last night as well didnt he gave him like two or but the game wasnt out of reach it was 41 so its like with odard coming on you think well he might do something to get them a point still late though i dont know why you they were one goal behind so i could sign of see the logic of it like he might 10 minutes though but i still thought it was even though i agree the de one the de one the de bruyne one is weird i think it will when de bruyer is playing i think it will have an impact on ph i think it probably means he goes out to the right still but we think hes less effective there with without walk cup so indeed diaz and salah diaz with a hattrick i said in my walkout video that it was only salah and then diaz goes and get the hatrick to shut me up what you think its going to happen this is this is its going to be like this all season jot comes back scores a brace diaz gets a goal gakpo suddenly is the best its im just not going near it youre i cant be i cant be dealing with it i do think though di diaz should be playing through the middle over darwin do you i like thats that gakpo diaz salah is that is a potent front could that be a thing i think so cuz so i think darwins been all right but i still dont think hes got a longterm future so in a world where diaz starts looking like he could play centrally well then that then i think that change when js back though youve still got that question mark around diaz and j but if js out for a while and diaz is playing through the middle then but 100 you said tonight you were in a sleeper call and you said that dan fbl mate offered us bowden for diaz he feels diaz end up being down the middle that isnt quite that isnt quite what happened i tried to pressure him into selling phone for diaz what are you doing without my permission we assistant manager you we comanagers what you well i thought once it once we got the offer then we could talk about it was i had to i had to give it the big the big talk at the time to try and get the off from the table youre just trying to get your own back for the fact that i turned down himz for intia i kept intia now hes injured and i missed out on all that did you turn it down turned it down i thought we missed it i was saying today i thought we miss turn it down also threw an insult sal as way and think do you think were stupid you might be able to catch us back from the pub i was i was always after that anyway that would have been a great move thanks eddie will come good dont worry a couple of years be fine palmer injury just a load of nonsense injury if he if he doesnt play ill eat this hoodie there you go i cant help but think that mesas gone okay alessas playing nonsense with sacka and all this stuff about you not pitched in the training picks and they play arsenal next and palmer is like palmers a player that would if arsenal thought he wasnt playing it could completely change their tactics so you got to think the mesas like well there could be he has hes not trained today and all this he hasnt trained because hes not playing in europe and we know that and he wasnt in any of the picks and all this stuff and its i dont know maybe im wrong for me the martinez challenge the contact was minimal it wasnt a regular challenge i know moresa said that and youre right but to me it didnt look like there was enough contact to make palmer injured out for the weekend but well see i think i think it was quite a quite a nasty knock and it is the thing that i could see being a bit of an impact injury that keeps you out of training for a couple of days but theres absolutely no way theres enough in that to keep you out of chelsea versus arsenal with the way chelsea are playing and at a time when arsenal were beatable at the moment this isnt the arsenal of like the end of last season when theyre winning every game chelsea look at that game and think we can do them over it theres just no way palmer doesnt play that game he just 100 im like 999 reoccurring percent sure he starts hell get patched up and play i dont think chelsea do it but well see when we get to predictions what i think there but i think that palmer plays for sure absolutely its not muscular its a knock thats thats the key thing and he and hes with the england squad as well and he would have they would have pulled him out of that moresa could have used this as an opportunity to pull him out of the england squad and said hes got a bit of a i re its palmer saying dont pull me out of it because im ive got to make a st for tel im fine see i buy that son will be a target if bren if palmer is out the natural thing would be for those without spurs players going into the it switch game if palmer is known as out you move salah if you can if you havent got him but i would have thought son would be the natural step down if before the break and then you have to go back to palmer after that if you add palmer and he is rolled out would you hold him through the break for 12 given that thats when we need him for that fixture run or would you move him out and spend two transfers what would you do and the other question i did the qa with sam for scout earlier and shes shes on a w so the moment shes got palmer and no son and i said to her why dont you well and she agreed like wouldnt you go for like son move to palmer afterwards because she havent got she hasnt got value tied up in him either shes buying palmer for the first time on the wild card youre booking in a transfer and everything like that i can see why you might not do it but even take taking a one if youre going to take a one week punt on a player son surely is the one that you take the punt on got some minutes in europe tonight home game against ip switch s hes arguably the best captain this week isnt he if you were free hitting youd be very tempted to give him the cabin you because hes got the pens right so thats the edge hes got over salanki and koseski and brennan and that is the pens right no well and johnson i could call him jonno if you like jonno its even worse but im im im i think thats the thats the step down that people will do it is a step down in price and then you have to get palmer back once he year fit i dont think its going to be i think its a nonissue no question though if youre i think youre right on the wild card if youre wild card in this week like sam is you go in you go all in on spurs dont you and then exit out game week 12 surely you go porro salanki and son dont you if you wild i think so unless youre taking palmer out and losing like triggers put in the in the chat if youre losing like 3 2 3 then i dont think you do but if you havent owned palmer like some idiots you and i up until up until now i think i think you definitely go for go for some go fair enough lets take on forwards then not too much to talk about that i want to talk about j pedro though hes not high in his table because he hasnt been about hes 23rd 35 x on ped per 90 coming back though with those good fixtures and he then enters the conversation that has been dominated by the likes of himz wood kuna recently i would say cal le but i dont want to keep mentioning him where do you stand on jia pedro do you like i know the algorithm is absolutely love him and theyre throwing him at me going hes on pedal is hes gonna they love him the models love jaia pedro so hes hes going to find his way back into teams isnt he well hell find his way back into teams but will he find his way back into the team thats the thats the big question thats what im asking you as the brighton f as the expert very brave asking me to predict brighton i feel like ive completely lost my what im im not even going to try and predict what the what the 11s going to be but what i will say is that weve got some good strikers for the first time in quite a few seasons who were playing 90 minutes weve got chriswood weve got kuna you could we got salanki you got nicholas jackson with good fixtures youve got vissa you might be keeping harland these are all you got welbeck whos playing like every minute as well havs with great arsenal fix you got so many good fix so many good players do you want to bring in a player who if he starts and he plays for brighton will score points because hes a great player and hes got penalties but he has such an unbelievable amount of competition that none of those other players have in his position i do think herz loves him though does hes hes said things to give us indication that hes he sees him as the man the player who can turn a game so absolutely but youve got rutter playing in the 10 at the moment whos been exceptional for about five or six weeks now so i dont think i dont think joe i think i think hes been i think hes been more than all right i think hes been brilliant i think hes been an excellent player and hes our record signing as well i think its very harsh if pedros fit and comes straight back in and replaces russer i think p i still think pedros ive said this all season im probably gonna be completely wrong i still think pedros best chance of getting into the team is as a nine and taking the place of welbeck can taking the place of wont do it wont happen it will it will not happen this side of christmas theres no way so hes either taking mats place on the left or hes taking the 10 weve got oreilly back like weve mentioned weve got r who i think has been playing well you got three players for one position why would you go there when youve got other strikers who are first choice talking of other options i havent mentioned either hazards or isac but theyre theyre edging havit with the fixtures hes edging back into the picture isach with a little bit of form how close what would they have to do to get you looking their way esack is someone i want i hes the fixtures are good look right the fixtures are good and hes hes one of those one of those strikers on penalties talisman of the team and i just think newcastle was just starting to turn a little bit of a corner with the way theyre playing football now theyve got a system thats working for they always look a bit more on it great win against arsenal to give him a bit of confidence as well and that west ham game in 12 i know thats the thing is it cuz 12 is the pivot thats where we all probably have two or three transfers and we go harland out palmer in and then its like who comes in for harland and theres jackson in the equation theres kuna maybe would but the fixtures are turning isaks got havitz will be in that picture because all right forest isnt easy but after that its west ham united fulham everton palace hit which good run but isaks going to be in that in that in a weeks time or after the international break when were sitting here doing this show then were going to be talking about where we go and isach and havit are going to be on the menu arent they well look at the start of the season we thought isap was going to be in our teams all year there wasnt there wasnt any well there was there was a couple but use the cal expression there was very few managers who went without ea game week one and okay it was a great fixture against southampton at home but the general consensus was hes going to kick on this year and do well and its its been a combination of newcast not playing well the injury hes had but i love that talisman forward for a side and he plays west ham leicester and ipswitch in six games as well with brenford thrown in and palace who he should get chances against too i like it if youre selling harland in 12 or 13 i think eack is one of the best pi its just a differential that itll be and i can say west ham are probably the worst premier league side ive seen at the city ground in my time since weve been up i thought that was it was they were so bad i know they were down to 10 men but it wasnt wasnt a lack of theyve got good players dont get me wrong but just in terms of the way they were looking around the pitch completely lost no direction no identity it was so archetype a team that didnt believe in what they were being told to do or anything they were doing it was so obvious from just watching the game and forest were just like well this is dick this is just were playing around them and theyre not there was just no teamwork no spirit everything you dont associate with west ham they are gone unless they get rid of ly and all the talk is ive watched a lot of le i watched a lot of west ham stuff after the match because i like to see what they say and they were talking a lot about their own situation as youd expect and they were saying that they dont think sullivan will get opy out because of the nature of the how they got him was relationship with the agent and so on and if thats true if sullivan does drag his feet getting ly out because i have no doubt its not going to work i dont see him turning it round west ham have got to be put in the bracket that weve put the likes of itswitch and southampton in terms of thats a fixture we need to target no question could score two or three goals in that game well absolutely and you look at you look at some of the other teams you look at everton and theyve had spells this season where theyve looked all right theyre still a team that you wouldnt fancy any given week but theyve got players in the team who can like harrison like oneal like mcneil sorry like im not even gna say cal lin but betto up top theyve got players in there who can who can under dice you always feel like theyve got a system i think southampton been better last few games theyve been playing quite well big win against everton and played pretty decently against man city and spells too you look at ip switch i think theyve got something about them good manager everyones fighting for the cause i look at all the teams and i think theres positives i look at west ham and i struggle to find the positives in that side i look right through the team and think wheres the wheres the quality there is quality there kudos is out for another two games thats a blow bowen is an exceptional player its and p bowen and petta petas gone though hes hes gone honestly not hes offering nothing to that team but this is the problem right theyve got qu if you if you look at west hams three best players its bowen petta and kudos peta when hes committed but hes not now hes not but same its the same with kudos kudus is the same kudus is an unbelievably like talented player but i dont i wouldnt rely on him every week to put in a eight or nine out of 10 hes hes got an attitude hes got an attitude may be but i think ls got something to do with that lki took him off at halftime at brenford what was that i dont know what was going on so maybe there is off the pitch stuff im just saying west ham is a far easier game at the moment than perhaps people think based on i think w i think west ham at home if i was picking a player in a game i would want west ham at home at the moment for my player spirit wise there its not its gone theyre gone theyre gone they its such a shame its like because i want theyve got good players who could be useful to us but i thats why isak could be a real big differential game week 12 for sure no question at all thought we do predictions lets talk about our sponsors as yes so it is sleeper of course we mentioned them already the sleeper draft were playing fpl mate whos top of the league in that in our in our next game if youre watching or listening to this you cant get involved in that but what you can get involved in is the blackbox pick them game which you probably heard us talk about already essentially if you zap the qr code thats on your screen if you watch this on desktop or theres a link in the description it will take you to sleep app download it completely free enter into the blackbox pickham league and all youve got to do is pick the outcomes of all the games in the premier league and the person at the end of the month who has predicted the most correct outcomes wins a prize up to the value of 500 so weve given away an apple watch a ps5 and a google pixel i believe phone not were just taking them for ourselves ive got well but yes get involved i know were just were sle bags but get involved and like i said completely free to play youre supporting the stream if you get involved and hopefully you can win a great prize too so zap the qr code or use the link in the description oe sack i dont know if youre a west ham fan no quality have great players play absolutely i agree i think i think petta is not the player he was hes unquestionably an absolute quality player kud also i think amazing player bowen an amazing player they have got antonio is not what he was so theyre struggling up front and i dont think bowman can play there i totally agree theyre just not playing for the manager i dont i dont think i dont think theyve got a great team they got fabianski in goal with emerson starting juan basaka i dont thinks good enough for a for a the decent side hes not good enough if youre playing three at the back hes good enough if youre playing four at the back but hes playing three at the back and hes asking him to contribute up the field which he cant do as we know so wouldnt take any of them a brion all right maybe bow was i was shocked by how poor they were cuz i know theyre much better than that when i saw them anyway its getting harder to get this screenshot as this is the lead of order predictions but every week i seem to have to scroll down to find you i dont know whats going on so the tables getting small its getting smaller font every week as i try and make it long fing 54 im on now im see ive almost caught hot iron in terms of correct outcome percentage now hes on hes come down to 55 so fair enough youre fresh me on outcomes and score youre doing well this i think this is this has got to be the first time ive been below 50 because 50 is always our target isnt it if youre doing if youre at 50 youre doing all right and ive dropped below the magic 50 mark so i need to i need to get back on it you do indeed hard season to predict it is over 1100 watching weve only got 200 likes what would you say that was you say that was ridiculous as or what would you say that was i would say its ridiculous this and im saying if youre watching this and you havent and you havent liked the stream youre a ridiculous person so please do especially if youre a west h fan cuz i love you i just think its a shame im going to see west h brighton with fella over christmas i think its like the 20th of december like that and we got a 50 quid bet on on brighton finishing above west ham this season i think at the start of season i wouldnt have said it but i think i think youre going to get that now but i think west h will turn it around but not unless sullivan gets l out sadly right lets go for our predictions theres no theres no early kickoff saturday i dont like that i dont like no kickoff hate that it means the leaks could be more prominent couldnt it as well which i dont like god ian theres not exactly many there not i just i dont want all that dont want all that again brenford bournemouth defense straight away interesting youve got 21 brenford ive i think brenford are a good team at home and i think bourma for a poor team away from home so i thought this was i thought this was quite a sensible one buar struggling away from home i just dont think brenford defensively are good enough to keep them out and i do wonder whether frank has like i say mve the d a little bit in terms of what hes going to allow them to do in i hope hes learning his lesson and hes going to go back to the fun chaotic brunford of old so youve gone one two one way ive gone two one the other fair enough palace fulham difference of opinion here as well youve gone on the way win one nil fulham ive gone one all want to b i think its quite an even game i just think fmer are a better side than palace at the moment palace have got a lot of injuries with wton and e both outs again not sure when theyre when theyre back or if theyre coming back if theyre both out again then they got big problems so ill back for them winding their sales after their comeback and look at this difference again youve backed west ham youre going 21 west ham over ever ive gone 21 everton i just couldnt back everton i dont know i think i think at home i think this was just this was just done by the home fixture i think if everton had been at home id have gone for an everton win i dont think theres much in it between them but west ham maybe just to just to nick it and buy him a bit of time before the inevitable sacking in a month no question west ham and a better side and they have more quality on the pitch but i just i dont know i just think the fights not there and i think if everton get one up theyll go two up i think west h might pull one back so thats the narrative im going with set pieces i think as well everton will cause them problems because we certainly did they didnt look that secure and set pieces defending them so i think ever will win it probably have a couple of corners michael keane and tarkovski probably like that w s anon we both agree on the outcome youve gone 21 ive gone 31 kuna returns here we havent talked about kuna i just did an article about him on a sports casting where his stats are crazy i didnt realize well i didnt hey how many attacking returns he got last season he got 17 which is incredibly impressive he was averaging 47 points which is the same as bruno fernandez was last year i know i know we sag off bruno a bit still thats an elite player playing for a topish side compared to one playing for a struggling wolf side the chances created most chances created of all forwards i think its like the third most shots of all forwards as well ridiculous like that hes just doing everything you want you forward to be doing hes hes involved with i think hes going to get something out this game we talked about him didnt we last week in terms of his relationship with the bonus is good because of the chance hes created and plus wolves dont keep it clean sheets so score a goal or get any a turn and hes straight in the bonus plus hes on penalties they know hes going to be in that discussion when we do the next episode when were looking at forwards to replace harland which im sure we will be fixtures are still good so but this is the fixture to own him for isnt it i think he comes out of this with potentially double figure return and maybe ain norway gets that clean sheet but well see in man city youve gone 31 man city ive got ive given you a point you just dont fancy it what does chris say what does your dad reckon do what i dont even i dont even think i will stick with this when because we still got time to edit these i think its 31 either way do you hows that for sitting on the fence i worry a little bit that we go for blood against them and we just get like annihilated and caught and foden turns up and harland they score im sure they score no doubt about that its it could its going to be a good game and its talk about garden center game this is not the game you want to miss this weekend but then part of me thinks if we do go out and go for them and we could play them off the park and then if we score a goal early and we get in their heads maybe we do go on and win it fairly comfortably i dont know tricky one ive im going to b the pessimism its the easiest one to do is its your own team so ill back city but i wouldnt be surprised bri w this we got consensus on the 800 kickoff saturday its liverpool villa weve both gone 2 nil routine i think that looks it done it for me villa are just something it wrong the traveling is going to this is their third away game in a row having gone to spurs bru and now anfield that does take it out of you and they just seem flat dont they and i think liverpool had the european game as well but i just dont see them slipping up theyre not slipping up are they liverpool no i cant see anything other than a routine that i think villa will theyve got the potential to cause problems because they have good players but whos going to benefit i think they i think they can put a shackle on roders and i dont think theyll got caught up with balls over the top like maybe they used to do under klopp so watkins might struggle a little bit i think fairly routin united leicester you are all in on united here arent here 30 well theyve scored nine goals all season theyre going to get 30 of that in one game here against a koopa low block seriously and its the first time that that leicester wont score all season against man utd im bought into the amaron hype you are i think i think the players do what there was a lot of criticism about man utd against chelsea i thought they were all right i thought they did all right i think they did enough to win that game with some of the chances they i think chelsea were the better side overall but i think united created more opportunities in that match theyve won again tonight they should be beating leicester comfortably with the players theyve got so im going to back them to do it give rude his send off i enough and this is interesting forest newcastle its the only garden center game i could pick out of this lot because im not going to go chelsea arsenal although i do think in terms of spectacle chelsea arsenal will probably be pretty dull and the predictions weve gone weve backed that up youve gone three2 to forest ive gone one all three2 do what five goals in this you think chris wood hatrick he did it last year at st james he did he did and theres some players with some beef with newcastle weve got weve got chris wood got the hatrick at st jamess part last year we got alango who they were after and we didnt let go to newcastle they came in with 50m right at the death and we said no so alanga would want to play up and see if he can tempt them again in january and weve got aliot anderson who was let go and they didnt want to let him go good hes a fantastic player so weve got weve got three of our most important and influential players with something to play for here but newcastle will turn up with a bit of form i think itll be a very good game in terms of it being a tactical battle i dont know if thered be a lot of goals but you think is im very surprised very surprised youve gone 3 to i think one all is a much more realistic outcome and i think if you do need to get down that garden center this is probably the only game i would i would recommend i am going to this nice im probably going to have the worst journey ever because its ra replacement service those dreaded free words no so i dont know how im going to get home bigger fan than i am i cant i cant not go even if its on telly because of forest are just riding a crest of a wave arent they so ive got to go look at this agreement spurs it which this is not very often we go the same on a score line like this we both gone 40 which makes me think i need to be taking salanki captain more seriously than i am is if you trip triple up on the spurs and the salanki captain tempting isnt it but you just think theres no way here that they dont just fres it which right well realistically they shouldnt theyre a great team at home and weve shown the stats today spurs are the top attacking side in the league it switch to the bottom defensive team in the league so theres absolutely theres nothing to suggest that spurs wont wont win this they are when you watch them and when theyre in full song and sanki has been an unbelievable signing if you take fpl out of the equation what he gives to that team and the way he brings others into the in terms of pressing its no wonder that theyre so h because he presses high he links up the play well brings in the wingers who are effective especially with sbach now theyve got even more of a weapon on the left and i cant see any way up switch have any have anything to be able to deal with them so indeed daniel how the turns have tabled exactly its like only a couple of weeks ago we were like kalanki got to go is he but now i was saying this to sam earlier when johnson scored i sent a like pissy message to yell was like im so stupid i should have gone for johnson over sank im so annoyed with myself and all this and then how quickly things turn around and now we predicting 40 and im going to captain him so fpl is a funny game chelsea arsenal youve gone nil ive gone one nil i think arsenal will just grind this out i think this will be a set piece goal and then they just frustrate chelsea i do think clean sheets are coming back into the arsenal armory again and i think this will be the first one as a nonpma owner were probably both biased and this could be a three all draw with palmer all in but i just dont see it being that match nor do you by a look of it no i think arsenal can contain palmer when he starts and im sure he will its the game isnt it where like he just its the game which the chelsea arsenal and i think i think it said man utd chelsea was like the most nil nils in premier league history like that these bigger games i always go into it with a bit of an expectation that its going to be a bit of a ball fest and arsenal liverpool was the exception because that was two and there was lots of goals in that but i think this is going to be a nil or a one nil eitherway thought you say so matt and fy fimy joyd are both doubting the spurs clean sheet but i refer the honorable gentleman to the attacking data which it switch a 086 xg non penalty per 90 that is incredibly poor so yes theyve got the lap but i think whats the whats the lap in terms of goal involvement have we got that on here we havent but i think his goaling go is something like 70 so you stop dap it which dont score and dap could score for them and that could be a factor but i think the logic behind the spurs clean sheet isnt the robustness of the spurs defense its the powder puffiness of the it switch attack right well the one weapon it switch do have is leaf davis from corner and youre benching im benching him but if theyre going to score if ifs swi score i bet its from a corner from a leaf davis corner well vicario and the spurs defense are all over the shop arent they for those god theyre so bad set pieces they so they saw it from against villa just viaro just doesnt know how to how to claim him hes hes a great keeper otherwise but he struggles in that area okay thats our predictions lets have a look briefly at the captaincy its a tough one isnt it because theres a theres a real spread because were going to have the harland owners were going to have the salah owners and then were going to have those who are going to go off the wall and go maybe a salanki or even an mumo maybe and its lovely to see i sit here now and think theres going to be a real when i when i check peoples teams like i do 1100 or whatever on saturday i will see a spread of captains across all those that i look at i think its this is exactly what we wanted what were going to have we perhaps further on i think so i think i think well see harland i think well see salah do you think itll be majority salah do you i think youll see all salas i think its going to be salah sal it does make me wonder bruno of course mentioned in chat there on matt does make me wonder whether i should go against that and go harland or even salanki because theres no question that those three players could lets have a look at robs graphic because i think that could tell us a bit more rob t at robt fbl do follow because he does some excellent stuff and this is just a sample this is showing the spread betting expected goals and expected clean sheets odds expected goals top of this is spurs to 290 then its united 245 liverpool 235 city are out at 205 so not in the top three in terms of surprised its that way around for liverpool city i thought given its villa and there are top sixish side and the fact that we going to conc h of a lot of chances more than likely i thought that would be the other way around but interesting does that make you think that that cements salah but it also says salan is the tilt right i just i sometimes i just feel that we do these podcasts we look at all these data we look at all these stats we spend however many hours a week looking at stats and drilling down and we have evidence to say that weve got the best attacking team in the league versus the worst defensive team in the league with a player whos just scored 16 points scored again in the europa league tonight clearly okay i dont know clearly now got something about him wind in his sales weve got salah with a fairly trick which could be a fairly tricky i think he still returns but it could be a fairly tricky game for him we got har bang off form im going for sanki i am very tempted because i think youre right its like how often do we have the worst attack against the worst defense with the with the confidence that way the only thing that makes me concerned is you look at the spurs attack and it could come from anywhere it could come from brennan it could come from son it could be kesi it could be madison madison will surely play this game so what i do know is that spurs wont let up it wont it you look at city and liverpool if they go 2n up you wouldnt say theyre going to run up 45 nil if spurs go twonil up it could easily be 4 five because an wont stop hell keep coming ratons injured y so did salanki start tonight i was be very no it came off lank started and got sent off okay so charltons injury for me that made me more interested in sank because i dont see sank getting subbed because who comes on and plays that central role and if anything think sons going to get subbed because hes back from injury johnson might get subbed mickey moore might come on the right hes as well is he right so johnsons probably 90 minutes as well then okay johnsons a fun one hes on this list as at list as well we know ipswitch are weaker down that side isnt the leaf davis side its ben johnson isnt it i think hes been playing for ip switch i wouldnt trust johnson then again i wouldnt trust its a funny one isnt it is brennan against leaf davis is because brennans right side up against the left side okay then i i fav that less then so its well its son up against ben johnson then if i if i if i had son id be very tempted or if i even if i didnt have son i had a route to get him id be very tempted by that the flip side his leaf davus does get forward and so brennan could get behind him i think he beats him for pace brennan i weve both predicted 40 so youve got to think that even if sanki doesnt come out as a top scorer here hes going to get a return son is the player to go for with the penalties as well im im i am now depending on what videos i watch on friday night im gonna go salanki so if i watch if i watch anything on salanki or spurs or ab adct which i probably will go that way if you see a video of do slon with a sausage dog thats going to be it isnt it i know thats all hes got to do thats all hes got to do im so im so open to persuasion on this one thats for sure if not ill just play safe with s but its its lovely to have a tt isnt it because thats a big tilt on your part for four with well lets have a look at our teams for it as ry in goal im envious ray is ray is in goal al its not i hope that nil comes through your one nil prediction but a little bit une easy its raya trent gabrielle and moreno as the defensive four its foden for one more week before i move over to palmer because ive got the money which ill talk about in a sec its inmo its garnacho little bit worried now seeing as amad has come on and scored two goals in the europa league rogers hes got the yellow flag but he played in the champion so hes going to be fine and its harand slanky captain and i did watkins out for kuna you got kuna thats nice thats nice i do like that team i like it i gu rogers g at foden theyre its a its a its a team which has potential to do because if sanki blanks and salah goes off and fens a bit of a gam im playing rogers against trend ive got double arsenal defense if chelsea score i dont know its its a team which i its not ide like im seeing sams wild card team for example im thinking god it looks strong with salah saaka and palmer all in there but then palmer and saaka playing each other i know im im im happy to own kuna though the plan was always to get to get kuna i was going to do harland and dibling out for salah and kuna but then i wouldnt have had the money to get palmer right so you can go palmer in what can you go palmer in one move next so i can do f to palo next week for so youre not going to go s at all no youre going to hold harland and not go salah well harand might be coming in for i might be doing harand to salah in 13 when they play each other but it will be holland over salah for the next two salahs got southampton game at 12 but hollands got spurs at home id expect him to do something in that and im cting palmer anyway against leicester so salo liverpool high press against s an i know there but then if i go for if i go for salah then im not gonna have palmer so theres theres always goingon to be someone that im gonna be id rather have salah at santon than palmer at leicester well i cant afford so i cant afford s in one move so its gonna have to be palmer i do have another free transfer though to use i dont want to play rogers away i am i but what you think so well i was i was thinking of maybe moving for a united defender and bringing in mazari or do maybe even for lewis because if im not playing lewis this game im not playing him against spurs and then im not playing him against liverpool when im when am i going to play him what about 8 nori says fb forest eight nor is fine but theyre not theyre not keeping clean sheets and i dont think hes gonna go i know but i dont think hes going to go on and get 20 attacking returns i could i could i could do lewis to i could do i could do lewis to someone i dont know but i quite like the idea of just saving the transfer cuz theres theres not many clean sheets around anyway rogers could get something against liverpool at least ive got some stake in the game if trent loses clean sheet so as im a little bit tempted by lewis to to mazra or d a little bit a little bit tempted m agre i like that one i dont leicester to score old trafford seems remote to me i just think cooper is going to low block there wont be much ambition i i think del could go on as well but if amam does come in and change the system and del playing wing back i think he could be a strong option so theres a py that wants to do it im im not i dont know im 5050 see how i feel comment of the night nooski as your team is not good i see 40 points perfect cheers nooski is there a prize for comment of the night we should have that if sank gets a couple of goals and foden and foden turns up its not going to be a midlin result this its going to be either absolute disastrous cuz i can see chelsea scoring i can see newcastle scoring i can see villa scoring i strangely i think trent is your best bet for a clean sheet i can see foden getting an hour and dea getting half an hour and foden coming off i can see salanki should be right i can see gacha and rogers blanking kuna should be right you do maybe it is a middling team maybe its not foden harand slanky kuna that theres those four theyre going to with this team this week i tell you what though i think i can catch you this week but it isnt going to be down to fleen fle thats thats your old team so thats a good start thats my is it thats your thats your old team sal against brighton slanky against god it is whats going on here let me i dont in that case and i dont think ive got my team let me try what am i goingon to do now then let me see if i can grab my team youll have to keep talking while i try and do this show cant even show the right i thought i thought i grabbed my team thats odd i dont know how i can do this now can you can you go back to my team then i can just talk through that a bit more sorry about that i thought id got that right but clearly not do what i knew i knew that this team was going to get slated by people this week because its got players in it that not a lot of people have got but ive seen enough from har and foden to think theyre both still good options like i said i think theyre going to were going to concede chances to them if gacho plays hes playing leicester i still think hes a good pick should have got more in that in that game slanky captains fun is a good option rogers is the weakest link in this side this week which is why is tempting to move to a dow or a or a mazari mazra the reason why i keep mentioning mazari by the way is not because i think hes a better option than dow its just the money masro is 45 i think dow is 51 theres a point 6 difference between them and if i am going to be looking to get sacker in the future like that im probably going to need that money the one thing is when it comes to gw 13 and i move harland out i might also be tempted to move trent out as well and thats going to free up a lot of money so that tempts me into just going for do because i think in a few weeks i might have some more money in the bank any i cant grab my team because i forgotten what the screenshot im on a mac and i dont know what the screenshot button is and its too complex to do so were just gonna have to just gonna have to talk through my team im afraid so sorry about this great if youre on the podcast not great if youre on the stream unless anyone knows what the screenshot button is on the on the mac but i dont use the mac often enough to know im sure therell be some this why i hate max always something ridiculous isnt it and then i cant i cant get the bloody bench in either because its too its the wrong format im trying just bear with me and i do this hold on three times and do a forward roll and thatll get you a something weird apple up three everyones saying different things i know ive got it command shift three now i dont know how to get it into the stream let me just see if this works let me just go on i dont know how this happen i love that everyones posting different commands for a screenshot no ones put the same one twice no i cant do it i cant do its no good cant do it right so my team is i just have to talk for it sorry for people on the on the stream its youre going so well mark until you got i know it was going well so my team is just for the podcast and for people listening it is gna be god this is a disaster it is fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis mumo johnson salah ameno harland and salanki so ive benching rogers at the moment do i play lewis or do i play rogers thats the question i think they both get one to two points so i think you probably play the attacker you did it there we go but im dragging it into the wrong screen if anyone would like a little bit of a window into to what its like doing these with mark this is its i cant do its all broken no two minutes later ive done it ive this is you every week every week its blurry though its not good quality but its the best i could do so fleen trent gabrielle porro lewis in johnson salah captain seeno maren salanki do i play rogers over lewis and do i captain salanki are the two questions im not going to make a transfer because i need to save the two for gw 12 with the palmer question in mind i am i think i think you i think you play rogers i think you play the its its its 5050 between i think you go you go for the city can seeed again dont they thats the thing its its just i dont back villa to score either so its not like no but whats more likely villa score or city dont concede i dont know thats close liverpool are the best defensive side and i dont think vill in great shape and not only a villa got a score but rogers has got to have something to do with it whereas i think its sorry i city could get your clean sheet but then lewis may not get may not start or may not even get the hour needed to get the clean sheet as well thats the other thing he could be subbed at half time now pep so they havent got the fit squad though you got to think lis will start but i just its easier to score a goal than it is to keep a clean j for 90 minutes thats very true and brighton will probably score maybe it is better to go with the attacking player again im open to persuasion friday night to see what happens but i think i think youre right i probably will go on the attack i do like the salanki captain cuz ive got harand and salah covered so therefore the damage that they can do in terms of if they haul is minimized by the fact i own them both whereas going salanki is a big differential and if he did come in with another double figure that would be a big swing in my favor i think this i think you could overtake me this week because theres not a lot wrong here is there are the trip i think poo could easily get a double figure if he gets sp if spurs win that 40 and porro and johnson both get returns ive got you ive got youre in my sights well see the rivalry this is the deciding season as well isnt it not its going to be that last one but its two all so this is no this is it no whoever wins this black box finishes at the end of this season so youve had enough youve had enough of the tantrums and the technical problems enough of the tantrums enough of bloody people in the chat having a go at me about barco its over i saw that was that was there some serious barco backlash i know people been a bit dick in the in the chat tonight so ive given a few people a timeout so they can think about what theyve done okay all right i dont i dont know why people have to bring barco up when was i it wasnt it wasnt about barco put you on a timeout next time you exactly so its all to play for isnt it i do think this is what i said a few weeks back its much more enjoyable season were not doing brilliantly and not many content creators are its a rarity that you see a content creator flying this season but i dont think many content creators will say that its not a better season as in terms of whats on offer from the game right i love it i think its great and i like the fact people look at my team and think its its crap because i look at it and think theres potential there with foden and and kuna and sanki captain and everyones team is going to be different and everyone is going to be biased to think that players they havent got in their team arent as good because thats why weve picked the players that weve got and not gone for the for the other ones so its fascinating theres going to be people and in a few weeks theres going to be people with teams without sacka and then people are going to say why is your team got sacka and its like because ive got palmer and sah and harand and its its its interesting at the moment were seeing like certain premium players dropping in form and things its going be when weve got if we get if we get to a point where weve got son saaka palmer harland and salah all delivering points and then you got hts and eak as well that and watkins maybe its its amazing itll be a great state of affairs i think the defenders not keeping clean sheets has changed things as well because were flashing money out and the four five aint nor is suddenly a hot property which i love it i love that as well its great weve got one super chat from at boy to address before we go thank you for the six year that boy and for your youre always there in chat thank you for all your support you always a support of the show great showers do you avoid starting a defender that plays one of your attackers i own vardy and have to have to start ana or maz rui so vardy is at united does he start maz ri a think you have to dont you i know what hes saying there dont you an i love i do think we could concede theres a theres a world in which we win one nil for sure cuz newcastle arent scoring a lot of goals and we are very strong defensively and it could be one of those games where one goal decides it so ana might not be a bad bet at all its not a bad choice to go ana but i do think united clean sheet against leicester is probably the most likely outcome dont you as i love that question because thats exactly what i asked you earlier is how much has that impact on it and ideally youd play mazari and not think twice about it because its a home game you didnt have v but then youve got vardy and youre thinking well i want vardy to score and then if he does score i dont want to be annoyed when mazari l his sheet i think it would it depends on my belly for a risk wouldnt it if where i am now i probably would go vard and ana and go because or you bench or you bench vardy and play mazari and ana i maybe think about that i i dont think but thens got penalties isnt he thats the thing i just dont know like they will low block and they will counter and vardy has got that turner pace and you maybe united go there go high line and vard i think id play i think id play vardy and mrai because i think theres all i think either way youre going to either get points from vardy or mazwi because if ler score itll be through vardy and if they dont the mai score so i think i i think id lean towards that but close good one at booy very good question which chimed with what we talked about tonight good show as thank you for that thank you for the 1200 still watching and all the support tonight wow amazing and i think this is my favorite season for three or four years i think possibly right up there with one of my favorites so far i hope it stays on this vein and i hope our teams remain aart not just our teams but everyone out there as well and its just a much more enjoyable season for it so looking forward to what this week brings i go into every game week thinking this could be one extreme or the other whereas last season it was like itll be another small red or small green whereas now it could be a big red or a big green or something extreme like that and me and you are tussling for the ranks now so i know im glad youve closed the gap makes it more interesting thats the thing i spent so long last season like even at like 3m in the first 10 weeks i was like 32m 29m 34m and like that like its im exactly the same rank as what i was like four weeks ago but its been like 800k 14m 500k yes i its been its been a lot more its been a lot more interesting and i think it when you see a player like sank gets 16 points and you look at your rank and you see the impact its had and its like wow hes not that highly owned because people have put so much money into salah and haren they cant afford salanki you got good managers without players like salanki because they cant theyve gone a different route which is also completely viable and well pay off in different weeks but every strategy is going to have its time to shine and its comms in which one was the one which will be which was the correct one bring it on bring on another game week maybe r it maybe green but well enjoy it anyway hopefully we keep saying that throughout the season thank you again for everyone who joined in tonight well see you soon hit the like if you enjoyed it hit the subscribe if youre new around here let me just let me just put that up look ive got the animation ive hard to use it there it is there we go look at that beautiful no beautiful and well see you well see you after the break it might be the second week before we go into game week 12 of course but well see you soon and ill do another walkabout at the weekend another international break on know well get through its the last one well get through it together and then plane sale into the end and christmas fixtures its a good night for me good night everyone for,26236
22,FPLBlackBox,1RDa1lLOWtQ,FPL Dom Delivers | GW10,2024-11-05T00:04:40Z,[Music] [Applause] what to go [Music] game week 10 then and another blank for harand that's just one return in five absolutely incredible um two undefeat for City at bouth Harland had five shots two big chances really frustrating again just snatching at the m and and it's just not running for him I mean it will change but then how long do we hold him I mean the tactic is in many circles now get rid of Harland for game week 12 move to Palmer start bringing in Arsenal assets again and it's hard to build a case not to do that it's Brighton next for Holland I think that is a good fixure for him and I think we hold for that if you still have him and then look at Game gameweek 12 as we say Spurs at home L is a good fixture so I think there's much to debate when we get there but as for this game week yeah frustrated again as I said it was the five shots 0.90 um XG in the game so a strong output in terms of data foden came out even better four shots and one chance created 1.04 was the most in the game week so far after Saturday's games but he again frustrated I got rid and I don't really regret that particularly with de brne back on the bench now for City that that would indicate to me that you know Pep's going to try and get de brne back in that team for obvious reasons to get things ticking again and what does that mean for fodm with with Savio around with dku around Savio surprisingly fit and back on the bench in this game after being carried off in midweek so foden for me although he stood out here is a concern going forward now that the bo is fit Elsewhere for City Vel got his third goal the season which is you know obviously ridiculous output for a Defender so far he started Lewis didn't now as a Lewis owner that is a little bit of a concern particularly after what pep said of the week about him he couldn't rest him he's the one player who couldn't rest him what does he do benches in for Bournemouth so predictable pep does like having fun with us doesn't he I'm not worried as a Lewis owner he's a player that I I don't rely on as my defensive free but I want to bring in with fixture and I think he will get back in the team after that rest as for vardal two clean sheets for City although the goal output is impressive I don't I don't really want to spend that amount on a player in a defense who who still concede goals um so for me V is a noo unless we're going to change our tactics and start spending big in defense and that's not the way it's going it's all going into Midfield which is why we're looking to get rid of Harland as for bouth I mean they have the one of the key players when it comes to saving money and that is seeno 56 he was impressive again here seven shots involvements I think it was four shots three chances created in the game um what was it 0.71 he exra ey from the from this game week right up there I think will be by the end of the game week if you got rid then I think you're going to want him back because on the ticker Balou for second only to woles uh over the next 11 12 game weeks so the fixtures are good for for seeno and bouth and he is clearly to stand out despite Evan Nelson get his third goal the season and kir has two assists for Bournemouth it's seeno the key asset [Music] but Arsenal also slipped up of course one- nil defeat at Newcastle and this was a really disappointing performance by Arsenal 1.05 the XG created in the game and sacka came out of it with just two shots and one chance created 0.45 xgi havs just one shot it's not enough is it um and we're starting to see them stutter with the injuries and dense in confidence Gabrielle did come back into the team to help their defense but it's now just uh what is it five of out a clean sheet now for Arsenal they've moved down to the fourth ranked defense in the league they're the seventh ranked attack in the league when looking at XG data so suddenly they're just they're not registering their Elite numbers and and assets like sackur and havs aren't the kind of go-tos that they were before I mean the fixtures have been tougher for them and certainly from gameweek 13 onwards that's when we're really starting to get interested in Arsenal once again and I think I will be moving to at least one of sacka or have averts but I'm probably not going to load up on that arsal defense until I see a bit more solidity I think it's at fullback they got the problem lot of rotation lot of injuries there lot of unsettled situations in that defense which has has meant that ryer and celba and Gabrielle really dropped off in terms of output as for Newcastle as isak and gold new combin for the goal no surprise they're their two key players but 0.53 xgi or XG in the game for new car suggest that they they haven't found the fluidity yet uh they go to Forest they go to City ground next and that's not going to be an easy game for Newcastle so I don't think that we're in any hurry to look at Newcastle but they could yet be some used to us over the season that's for [Music] sure Liverpool do what Liverpool been doing all season grinding out the result One n down to a Brighton side that Lo they had looked like they had the better of them in that first half which they did but slot did the magic again at Hal time didn't tweet tactically but just got more out of his team and they turned it round to win the game 2-1 Salah of course with the crucial winner a lot of lot of managers moved off Holland to Captain Salah and it worked out I captain Salah and it worked out and he came out the game with five shot involvements it was two chances created three shots for not for 65 xgi I guess the big news here though was the team news from slot he rested Diaz to the bench again started gakpo rested Robertson who looks now like he might have lost his place at left back to Simas and Simas came out with three chances created one shot as well 0.56 XG which significantly surpassed Tren Alexander Arnold who only created two chances for 0.10 so if Simas has got that left back spot now at 46 that's an obvious downgrade if you want to move money off Trent and it's becoming harder and harder by the game week to justify holding on to Trent Liverpool defense is still top ranked it's still one we've got to consider um despite conceding here but they lost canate to an arm injury and it was interesting that Gomez at 48 was the player to come off the bench not Quant to replace him so there could be another budget option there and I guess you got to ask with with Simas and Gomez perhaps in that starting Liverpool defense now are they going to be as secure they've done okay with with Allison out and he'll be back soon we would have fought after the international break so that might signal another increase in solidity at the back for Liverpool with Allison there although Keller has been good so they were a defense and a team that we got to look at but it's in attack where it's all about and I think with J out injured and now Diaz benched again it is boiling down to you got to have Salah AR you and I think with the fixures that Liverpool have got and the form that he's shown nine points here almost a seventh double digit return his consistency is extraordinary and as we move away from Harland it's just becoming obvious that salah's got to be a Target ASA Brighton the one player that stood out for me and I mentioned in Black Box in the week cat Ogo who play played right Midfield rather than right right fullback and got his goal uh two shots and one chance created 0.30 xgi with Brighton's fixtures really perking up very very soon as part of that swing from game week 12 I think CAD Ogo as a Defender has got to be worth a look [Music] so I was at the city ground to witness the latest victory for for three in a row now absolutely extraordinary uh three and0 over West Ham it was very very routine and Chris Wood an eight for the season he is an absolute machine just can't be stopped uh two shots .79 XG I in the game um I mean cleared one off the line as well declared man of the mat I'm not sure he was there was a lot of good players on show for Forest but wood it's hard as I said to make a case against him because Forest are getting him the it was Moreno Who provided the assist uh in this game Mareno had his best attacking game for Forest but Ana also came out with a goal the other fallback and then minkovich was so unfortunate he had one just wide one headed just wide another effort palmed over by fabianski with a great save it's only a matter of time for milenovic gets that attack in return so so much potential in this Forest side haven't even talked about Hudson Ado who came out with eight shot involvements four shots four chances created got the goal of course so there's just value in that forest team everywhere the thing is the fixtures do stiffen up it's Newcastle then it switch but then it does get tougher for Forest but they're a team that are just not going to be a pushover for anyone and I think they're going to keep clean sheets when you don't expect them to as we saw at anfield so I I can't really back against going with one of the defense and Chris Wood at the moment although there are many many options up top eight goals for the season and the service just keeps coming and the confidence that Forest side is just on such a new level uh and it was so obvious that there was a golf in ability I think in what we saw in that game against West Ham but a golf in also the confidence level the spirit in the team West Ham looks shot absolutely shot I'd be very surprise if L can hold on to that job and if you've got boing yeah I mean I I admire you for the differential but that West Ham team just aren't playing well there's no confidence no Spirit there and and I think they're going to struggle while ly I just can't see him finding the solution so for me West Ham remain and noo Forest the [Music] opposite it's switch one Lester one pretty predictable outcome from this game and I guess it was only a matter of time before Leaf Davis rewarded his owners as well if you didn't bench him like as have to enjoy that so Leaf Davis with the goal came out with three chances created and the one shot 0.31 xgi he is a great asset in a promoted side but it's a promoted side that is going to concede goals not keep clean sheets and they're not going to score too many either so it's very similar to what we saw with d last season although I do think the leave Davis is a step up it's tough fixtures to come now though Spurs United and then Firs for it switch so if you're holding Davis you're probably going to bench him over those games anyway as for Leicester B A not to stand out I think he's outstanding another six shot involvements three chances created three shots and the fixtures do turn from game week's 14 onwards for Leicester and I I think like he bit like Leaf Davis he's never going to be an asset that we can rely on and play every week but when fixtures are good I think he's a player we got to look at and that run for leester is tempting and he is absolutely outstanding for me [Music] so anom w Everton Neil a game of little consequence really in fbl terms apart from more Agony for Calvi lein owners I I shouldn't tease them but it's now six successive blanks with a start he only played an hour here before ironically being replaced by Betto Who had who had Everton's best chances and perhaps should have got them at least an equalizer and beta came on and topped the xgi in this game as well calv L only had one shot he's had I think 16 shots over the six last six starts without a goal um and yeah he would he would he hold his place I guess they keep faith in him but I don't know I I think if you're holding calv lein you're this long this was the fixure that you were going to hold him for but then you've got to get rid and I just think there's too many options now uh as for M Neil he came back and I didn't expect him to and it is West Ham and brenford next there are two defenses that are going to give up chances so if you're holding it now I think you can you can stay patient and less so I think with calv Le given the confidence and given the profile for better which is rising all the time uh as for Southampton not too much to talk about from a fancy perspective if you had Harwood Bellis and started him well done first clean sheet for Southampton H and as for dibling owners they saw their player benched and so he's perhaps becoming a fringe player again and not that four five budget option that we hoped he would be [Music] entertaining draw at molu to all um a lot of investment in this game in ain't Nori and kuna and I I think it's warranted we say that you know the fixture ticker is just overwhelmingly positive for O'Neal's side and I think those two assets showed enough in this game to think that we'll get returns from them kuna came out with an assist but again he was he's their one key player strand lson got the goal set up by kuna but he also set up three other chances came out of it at 0.32 xgi but he's by far their key player and I think he will be profitable for FB managers over this run as for eight Nori I think he had a couple of shots no chances created you're not going to get clean sheets in I don't think that will be a rarity so you are relying on attacking returns a bit like Leaf Davis but I do see think it's warranted given his price 46 and given the fixtures that got but kuna for me is the big standout as for Palace they're really a nogo in fancy terms particularly why a is out so not really anything to talk about of note here maybe when a is back we we'll start seeing some appeal but right now the interest is all about WS in this game and it's Justified [Music] so that's it for Saturday's games uh not going badly for me this week CU I had the Sal captaincy and also I started seeno and bench Lewis nothing Shady there before you say it I just thought the Bournemouth would score and obviously that would mean start seeno and bench Lewis um worked out for me Sania with the goal and like I said a player I'm going to hold on to now I've got five players no six players left to go including four in the Spurs Villa game so so I've got Pao Johnson Rogers and salanki big game for salanki If he if he really doesn't show up in this game and I mean just a couple of shots would be nice wouldn't it then I think that he's going to be a big sell very very soon I'll probably hold him for the it switch game but after that he's going to be gone unless we say something spectacular here big game I think for Villa as well I mean Watkins that you know I think he needs of a turn in this game to hold off to stve off that move towards the cheaper Strikers like Kuna who we've discussed and Rogers you know he's one of several midfielders that may make weigh in teams I've talked about those who got rid of seeno I've got Johnson seeno hbmo and Rogers one of those has got to go because obviously salah's not going to go when I move to Palmer and right now I am thinking it could be Rogers so how he performs and what he produces in this game could be key to whether that changes my mind well I asked for the spectacular from San and I got it a 16o return biggest of the season five shots All In The Box 1.52 xgi the top in the game week so far with one game to go we got what we wanted from him um I think the difference was that he was spending much more time in central areas further forward and they were getting crosses in that's the big thing I mean it as it turned out Johnson's goal Johnson got a goal from his only shot in the game he took that off the toe of sank it could have easily been a hattick he had a half chance in the first half as well so much better from Dominic salanki just when we needed it as well obviously a massive return for my team more on that in a bit Johnson also came in only had that one shot as I say not point6 for is XG from that effort but it's seven goals in 11 games now for Johnson no question that he is a threat and he's and he's getting more minutes there is just no one Off the Bench who can replace him he was absolutely shattered at the end but but an isn't really subbing him early anymore um so that's a key thing he's on the pitch at the death um unlike son who only had two chances created in the game very quiet overall obviously created that goal got the assist for Johnson um but yeah really didn't have a Major Impact was very myth to go off on the hour mark was a bit of a surprise because it was one all at the time but in the end rardon came on and set up that goal got an assist himself so for sank second so yeah overall a great attacking performance by Spurs and they're the only team now who are averaging over two xgi non- penalty per 90 they are the top attacking side and they take that record into its which at home next who have an XGC non penalty P 2.15 so it's the best attack versus the best defense when it comes to XG and XG conceded coming next and as a manager who holds porro Johnson and salanki that's got to be encouraging do you do you hold slanky for that course you do and maybe after as well they go to Man City and week 12 that'll be the crunch fixture because I won't know whether I need to get rid of Johnson or salanki what I do with Spurs but their fixures after that aren't too bad and I actually think you know we've seen Spurs go to the EAD and cause them problems and we're seeing a lot of teams this season cause City problems so I'm not against taking my Spurs players into that and perhaps if you have to hold salanki for the trip to the Yad if it's off another return against it rich that might not be a bad thing as for Villa in this game Rogers gave me plenty of food for for as well I talk about whether it was him I was going to get rid of he got the goal obviously he couldn't miss it from the corner it was a bad mistake at the set piece Again by Spurs who really struggle with those don't they um but yeah he did his piece I mean he he had four shots uh no four shot involvements two chances created Two Shots Watkins in contrast was very very quiet just two shots 0.46 three touches in the Box just one goal in four now for Watkins and that's a concern he got a price drop overnight so people are moving him out and I can't say I blame them really because those cheaper options as I said are very very tempting and it's Liverpool way next before the fixtures pick up with Palace brenford of Southampton the next three at Villa Park so maybe a hold but I can see why people needing to flush the cash out are getting rid of Watkins one1 at Old Trafford and that last a goal War turn for Bruno from the spot um I mean basically it's been due he's had five shots in each of his last two games he had eight shot involvements in this game four chances created four shots the penalty was in the end the decisive action but yeah the data has been pointing to this and pointing to a surgence in Bruno could he become an elite asset again under amarim I don't know I mean the fixtures are certainly there there's no doubt Lester it's which Everton the next three for United but I do look at their attack and think rashford gach show hland are these ruthless takers of chances that Bruno is going to get assist from that's the that's the key issue United I think it's nine goals all season only Southampton I think have scored less so are we going to see that overnight Resurgence of that United attack I think it's a big ask but obviously if you got to make up ground with those fixtures Bruno could be an option the issue for me is just the Midfield places I've spoken about what am I going to do to make room for Palmer and yeah finding a place for Bruno as well I I just don't see it and for me that it's a little bit optimistic on the impact of the new manager as for Chelsea I mean Palma had a fairly quiet game still sneaked in for one bonus points low six shot involvements on the day three shots three chances created 0.71 xgi I don't think he had his best game less impactful than I would want and it interesting as well he he started out on the left hand side again rather than the right and I think he's coupled with Reese James because when Reese James switched in the second half and karella came on we saw Palmer go with James as well back to the right hand side so I think there's something going on there with morasa tying up Reese James with with Palmer because on the other side he inverts the fallback which obviously uses up the spaces that Palmer would be in on that flank so I think that's a thing to watch for I think it's debatable yet whether that's impacting Palmer's output but there's no question for gameweek 12 with the fixtures Chelsea has got he's got to be a Target I don't I don't think I'm going to change my plan there he's coming in in game week 12 and I'm going to have to sell Harland to make way for that move else were for Chelsea not too much to talk about other than Jackson picking up his fourth yellow card the season he had one chance cre that's all really a disappointing game for him and that fourth yellow makes him a risk now among other players we talked about seeno yesterday forgot to mention he's on four bookings as well along with eight Nory so we've got to watch that now we're getting close to those first suspensions and they should be factors in our thinking when it comes to transfers well that was a crazy game um as a fleen owner it was absolutely heartbreaking I knew it would happen I absolutely knew it he was sitting on 12 points got 10 saves and I was I was chatting to as on WhatsApp going and as me said to me when do you think he'll break your heart and I said when he gets maximum bonus then he then he'll the bed and he did exactly that in spectacular style brenford completely blowing it conceding two late goals fleen going from 12 points to four it would have been an amazing hall for a keeper that hasn't kept the clean sheet All Season against a team who have scored in every game it was inevitable I knew it would happen and it did um and um so to be honest I dealt with it okay and and to be honest I had a good game we more than that in a minute but from the game very low impact on fantasy really uh Wilson Bas Robinson got an assist he was probably the only asset to come out with points in the game that had impact on fbl uh himz went off after 70 minutes had two shots 0.09 xgi so really low xgi in the game back-to-back blanks for himz now don't think it's a major concern and they've got Crystal Palace and wolves next so the fixures are still good for him and his owners and although munees is there I think it will take another couple of blanks then you got to start to worry so there is concern particularly if he doesn't get a goal the next two um elsewhere inuma is completely Anonymous for brenford as an attacking Force they were they were just not at the races at all they got the early goal and then they just sat on it and I guess they got what they deserved in a way because they didn't show Too Much ambition um but yeah so very little in the game um for for FPL managers in the end uh I came out of it a Four Points of fle and I'll take that and three for bumo I'll definitely take that brenford got Bournemouth Everton and Leicester next no clean sheets for for fleen there but I'll certainly take the Four Points it's just a heartbreak in having had the 12 but 75 points for the game week for me which is which is crazy um just what I needed up to 1.4 million a rank gain of 1.9 million which is exactly what I said on blackbox last week I said that although I was having a bad season for rank I always felt this season there were big Point swings in it because of the way that the variety of teams uh and the variation in The Heavy Hitters and um yeah just by playing Sano and Captain in Salah and obviously Johnson came in as well as did Rogers I had this massive rank climb so I'm I feel much better about my rank now and ongoing continue to enjoy this season so let's see how it goes from here um hope you had a good game week just a bit of injury that came in today uh canate is fit looks like he's going to be okay so no danger there if you own canate and and no appeal for Gomez if you were thinking of going that way elsewhere Palmer apparently picked up a knee injury from that from that uh Tackle by Martinez I'm that didn't look serious to me but there's there's lots of stories going around about that uh and also harand picked up a training injury there was something on sky today which is pretty laughable I don't believe a word of that and obviously they've got the European game coming up so we'll get it on that um we'll round all that up on blackbox we'll be back uh on Thursday I think it'll be so me and a will be talking then uh I'm I've closed the gap on him feel a lot better feel more optimistic hope you do too crazy game week lots more to come hope you like this hit the Subscribe button if you're new and if you did like the video hit like and I'll see you next time,4988,what to go game week 10 then and another blank for harand thats just one return in five absolutely incredible two undefeat for city at bouth harland had five shots two big chances frustrating again just snatching at the m and its just not running for him it will change but then how long do we hold him the tactic is in many circles now get rid of harland for game week 12 move to palmer start bringing in arsenal assets again and its hard to build a case not to do that its brighton next for holland i think that is a good fixure for him and i think we hold for that if you still have him and then look at game gw 12 as we say spurs at home l is a good fixture so i think theres much to debate when we get there but as for this game week frustrated again as i said it was the five shots 090 xg in the game so a strong output in terms of data foden came out even better four shots and one chance created 104 was the most in the game week so far after saturdays games but he again frustrated i got rid and i dont regret that particularly with de brne back on the bench now for city that would indicate to me that peps going to try and get de brne back in that team for obvious reasons to get things ticking again and what does that mean for fodm with savio around with dku around savio surprisingly fit and back on the bench in this game after being carried off in midweek so foden for me although he stood out here is a concern going forward now that the bo is fit elsewhere for city vel got his third goal the season which is ridiculous output for a defender so far he started lewis didnt now as a lewis owner that is a little bit of a concern particularly after what pep said of the week about him he couldnt rest him hes the one player who couldnt rest him what does he do benches in for bournemouth so predictable pep does like having fun with us doesnt he im not worried as a lewis owner hes a player that i dont rely on as my defensive free but i want to bring in with fixture and i think he will get back in the team after that rest as for vardal two clean sheets for city although the goal output is impressive i dont i dont want to spend that amount on a player in a defense who still concede goals so for me v is a noo unless were going to change our tactics and start spending big in defense and thats not the way its going its all going into midfield which is why were looking to get rid of harland as for bouth they have the one of the key players when it comes to saving money and that is seeno 56 he was impressive again here seven shots involvements i think it was four shots three chances created in the game what was it 071 he exra ey from the from this game week right up there i think will be by the end of the game week if you got rid then i think youre going to want him back because on the ticker balou for second only to woles over the next 11 12 game weeks so the fixtures are good for seeno and bouth and he is clearly to stand out despite evan nelson get his third goal the season and kir has two assists for bournemouth its seeno the key asset but arsenal also slipped up of course one nil defeat at newcastle and this was a disappointing performance by arsenal 105 the xg created in the game and sacka came out of it with just two shots and one chance created 045 xgi havs just one shot its not enough is it and were starting to see them stutter with the injuries and dense in confidence gabrielle did come back into the team to help their defense but its now just what is it five of out a clean sheet now for arsenal theyve moved down to the fourth ranked defense in the league theyre the seventh ranked attack in the league when looking at xg data so suddenly theyre just theyre not registering their elite numbers and assets like sackur and havs arent the gotos that they were before the fixtures have been tougher for them and certainly from gw 13 onwards thats when were starting to get interested in arsenal once again and i think i will be moving to at least one of sacka or have averts but im probably not going to load up on that arsal defense until i see a bit more solidity i think its at fullback they got the problem lot of rotation lot of injuries there lot of unsettled situations in that defense which has meant that ryer and celba and gabrielle dropped off in terms of output as for newcastle as isak and gold new combin for the goal no surprise theyre their two key players but 053 xgi or xg in the game for new car suggest that they havent found the fluidity yet they go to forest they go to city ground next and thats not going to be an easy game for newcastle so i dont think that were in any hurry to look at newcastle but they could yet be some used to us over the season thats for sure liverpool do what liverpool been doing all season grinding out the result one n down to a brighton side that lo they had looked like they had the better of them in that first half which they did but slot did the magic again at hal time didnt tweet tactically but just got more out of his team and they turned it round to win the game 21 salah of course with the crucial winner a lot of lot of managers moved off holland to captain salah and it worked out i captain salah and it worked out and he came out the game with five shot involvements it was two chances created three shots for not for 65 xgi the big news here though was the team news from slot he rested diaz to the bench again started gakpo rested robertson who looks now like he might have lost his place at left back to simas and simas came out with three chances created one shot as well 056 xg which significantly surpassed tren alexander arnold who only created two chances for 010 so if simas has got that left back spot now at 46 thats an obvious downgrade if you want to move money off trent and its becoming harder and harder by the game week to justify holding on to trent liverpool defense is still top ranked its still one weve got to consider despite conceding here but they lost canate to an arm injury and it was interesting that gomez at 48 was the player to come off the bench not quant to replace him so there could be another budget option there and you got to ask with simas and gomez perhaps in that starting liverpool defense now are they going to be as secure theyve done okay with allison out and hell be back soon we would have fought after the international break so that might signal another increase in solidity at the back for liverpool with allison there although keller has been good so they were a defense and a team that we got to look at but its in attack where its all about and i think with j out injured and now diaz benched again it is boiling down to you got to have salah ar you and i think with the fixures that liverpool have got and the form that hes shown nine points here almost a seventh double digit return his consistency is extraordinary and as we move away from harland its just becoming obvious that salahs got to be a target asa brighton the one player that stood out for me and i mentioned in black box in the week cat ogo who play played right midfield rather than right fullback and got his goal two shots and one chance created 030 xgi with brightons fixtures perking up very soon as part of that swing from game week 12 i think cad ogo as a defender has got to be worth a look so i was at the city ground to witness the latest victory for three in a row now absolutely extraordinary three and0 over west ham it was very routine and chris wood an eight for the season he is an absolute machine just cant be stopped two shots 79 xg i in the game cleared one off the line as well declared man of the mat im not sure he was there was a lot of good players on show for forest but wood its hard as i said to make a case against him because forest are getting him the it was moreno who provided the assist in this game mareno had his best attacking game for forest but ana also came out with a goal the other fallback and then minkovich was so unfortunate he had one just wide one headed just wide another effort palmed over by fabianski with a great save its only a matter of time for milenovic gets that attack in return so much potential in this forest side havent even talked about hudson ado who came out with eight shot involvements four shots four chances created got the goal of course so theres just value in that forest team everywhere the thing is the fixtures do stiffen up its newcastle then it switch but then it does get tougher for forest but theyre a team that are just not going to be a pushover for anyone and i think theyre going to keep clean sheets when you dont expect them to as we saw at anfield so i cant back against going with one of the defense and chris wood at the moment although there are many options up top eight goals for the season and the service just keeps coming and the confidence that forest side is just on such a new level and it was so obvious that there was a golf in ability i think in what we saw in that game against west ham but a golf in also the confidence level the spirit in the team west ham looks shot absolutely shot id be very surprise if l can hold on to that job and if youve got boing i admire you for the differential but that west ham team just arent playing well theres no confidence no spirit there and i think theyre going to struggle while ly i just cant see him finding the solution so for me west ham remain and noo forest the opposite its switch one lester one pretty predictable outcome from this game and it was only a matter of time before leaf davis rewarded his owners as well if you didnt bench him like as have to enjoy that so leaf davis with the goal came out with three chances created and the one shot 031 xgi he is a great asset in a promoted side but its a promoted side that is going to concede goals not keep clean sheets and theyre not going to score too many either so its very similar to what we saw with d last season although i do think the leave davis is a step up its tough fixtures to come now though spurs united and then firs for it switch so if youre holding davis youre probably going to bench him over those games anyway as for leicester b a not to stand out i think hes outstanding another six shot involvements three chances created three shots and the fixtures do turn from game weeks 14 onwards for leicester and i think like he bit like leaf davis hes never going to be an asset that we can rely on and play every week but when fixtures are good i think hes a player we got to look at and that run for leester is tempting and he is absolutely outstanding for me so anom w everton neil a game of little consequence in fbl terms apart from more agony for calvi lein owners i shouldnt tease them but its now six successive blanks with a start he only played an hour here before ironically being replaced by betto who had who had evertons best chances and perhaps should have got them at least an equalizer and beta came on and topped the xgi in this game as well calv l only had one shot hes had i think 16 shots over the six last six starts without a goal and he would he would he hold his place they keep faith in him but i dont know i think if youre holding calv lein youre this long this was the fixure that you were going to hold him for but then youve got to get rid and i just think theres too many options now as for m neil he came back and i didnt expect him to and it is west ham and brenford next there are two defenses that are going to give up chances so if youre holding it now i think you can you can stay patient and less so i think with calv le given the confidence and given the profile for better which is rising all the time as for southampton not too much to talk about from a fancy perspective if you had harwood bellis and started him well done first clean sheet for southampton h and as for dibling owners they saw their player benched and so hes perhaps becoming a fringe player again and not that four five budget option that we hoped he would be entertaining draw at molu to all a lot of investment in this game in aint nori and kuna and i think its warranted we say that the fixture ticker is just overwhelmingly positive for oneals side and i think those two assets showed enough in this game to think that well get returns from them kuna came out with an assist but again he was hes their one key player strand lson got the goal set up by kuna but he also set up three other chances came out of it at 032 xgi but hes by far their key player and i think he will be profitable for fb managers over this run as for eight nori i think he had a couple of shots no chances created youre not going to get clean sheets in i dont think that will be a rarity so you are relying on attacking returns a bit like leaf davis but i do see think its warranted given his price 46 and given the fixtures that got but kuna for me is the big standout as for palace theyre a nogo in fancy terms particularly why a is out so not anything to talk about of note here maybe when a is back well start seeing some appeal but right now the interest is all about ws in this game and its justified so thats it for saturdays games not going badly for me this week cu i had the sal captaincy and also i started seeno and bench lewis nothing shady there before you say it i just thought the bournemouth would score and that would mean start seeno and bench lewis worked out for me sania with the goal and like i said a player im going to hold on to now ive got five players no six players left to go including four in the spurs villa game so ive got pao johnson rogers and salanki big game for salanki if he if he doesnt show up in this game and just a couple of shots would be nice wouldnt it then i think that hes going to be a big sell very soon ill probably hold him for the it switch game but after that hes going to be gone unless we say something spectacular here big game i think for villa as well watkins that i think he needs of a turn in this game to hold off to stve off that move towards the cheaper strikers like kuna who weve discussed and rogers hes one of several midfielders that may make weigh in teams ive talked about those who got rid of seeno ive got johnson seeno hbmo and rogers one of those has got to go because salahs not going to go when i move to palmer and right now i am thinking it could be rogers so how he performs and what he produces in this game could be key to whether that changes my mind well i asked for the spectacular from san and i got it a 16o return biggest of the season five shots all in the box 152 xgi the top in the game week so far with one game to go we got what we wanted from him i think the difference was that he was spending much more time in central areas further forward and they were getting crosses in thats the big thing it as it turned out johnsons goal johnson got a goal from his only shot in the game he took that off the toe of sank it could have easily been a hattick he had a half chance in the first half as well so much better from dominic salanki just when we needed it as well a massive return for my team more on that in a bit johnson also came in only had that one shot as i say not point6 for is xg from that effort but its seven goals in 11 games now for johnson no question that he is a threat and hes and hes getting more minutes there is just no one off the bench who can replace him he was absolutely shattered at the end but an isnt subbing him early anymore so thats a key thing hes on the pitch at the death unlike son who only had two chances created in the game very quiet overall created that goal got the assist for johnson but didnt have a major impact was very myth to go off on the hour mark was a bit of a surprise because it was one all at the time but in the end rardon came on and set up that goal got an assist himself so for sank second so overall a great attacking performance by spurs and theyre the only team now who are averaging over two xgi non penalty per 90 they are the top attacking side and they take that record into its which at home next who have an xgc non penalty p 215 so its the best attack versus the best defense when it comes to xg and xg conceded coming next and as a manager who holds porro johnson and salanki thats got to be encouraging do you do you hold slanky for that course you do and maybe after as well they go to man city and week 12 thatll be the crunch fixture because i wont know whether i need to get rid of johnson or salanki what i do with spurs but their fixures after that arent too bad and i think weve seen spurs go to the ead and cause them problems and were seeing a lot of teams this season cause city problems so im not against taking my spurs players into that and perhaps if you have to hold salanki for the trip to the yad if its off another return against it rich that might not be a bad thing as for villa in this game rogers gave me plenty of food for as well i talk about whether it was him i was going to get rid of he got the goal he couldnt miss it from the corner it was a bad mistake at the set piece again by spurs who struggle with those dont they but he did his piece he had four shots no four shot involvements two chances created two shots watkins in contrast was very quiet just two shots 046 three touches in the box just one goal in four now for watkins and thats a concern he got a price drop overnight so people are moving him out and i cant say i blame them because those cheaper options as i said are very tempting and its liverpool way next before the fixtures pick up with palace brenford of southampton the next three at villa park so maybe a hold but i can see why people needing to flush the cash out are getting rid of watkins one1 at old trafford and that last a goal war turn for bruno from the spot its been due hes had five shots in each of his last two games he had eight shot involvements in this game four chances created four shots the penalty was in the end the decisive action but the data has been pointing to this and pointing to a surgence in bruno could he become an elite asset again under amarim i dont know the fixtures are certainly theres no doubt lester its which everton the next three for united but i do look at their attack and think rashford gach show hland are these ruthless takers of chances that bruno is going to get assist from thats the thats the key issue united i think its nine goals all season only southampton i think have scored less so are we going to see that overnight resurgence of that united attack i think its a big ask but if you got to make up ground with those fixtures bruno could be an option the issue for me is just the midfield places ive spoken about what am i going to do to make room for palmer and finding a place for bruno as well i just dont see it and for me that its a little bit optimistic on the impact of the new manager as for chelsea palma had a fairly quiet game still sneaked in for one bonus points low six shot involvements on the day three shots three chances created 071 xgi i dont think he had his best game less impactful than i would want and it interesting as well he started out on the left hand side again rather than the right and i think hes coupled with reese james because when reese james switched in the second half and karella came on we saw palmer go with james as well back to the right hand side so i think theres something going on there with morasa tying up reese james with palmer because on the other side he inverts the fallback which uses up the spaces that palmer would be in on that flank so i think thats a thing to watch for i think its debatable yet whether thats impacting palmers output but theres no question for gw 12 with the fixtures chelsea has got hes got to be a target i dont i dont think im going to change my plan there hes coming in game week 12 and im going to have to sell harland to make way for that move else were for chelsea not too much to talk about other than jackson picking up his fourth yellow card the season he had one chance cre thats all a disappointing game for him and that fourth yellow makes him a risk now among other players we talked about seeno yesterday forgot to mention hes on four bookings as well along with eight nory so weve got to watch that now were getting close to those first suspensions and they should be factors in our thinking when it comes to transfers well that was a crazy game as a fleen owner it was absolutely heartbreaking i knew it would happen i absolutely knew it he was sitting on 12 points got 10 saves and i was i was chatting to as on whatsapp going and as me said to me when do you think hell break your heart and i said when he gets maximum bonus then he then hell the bed and he did exactly that in spectacular style brenford completely blowing it conceding two late goals fleen going from 12 points to four it would have been an amazing hall for a keeper that hasnt kept the clean sheet all season against a team who have scored in every game it was inevitable i knew it would happen and it did and so to be honest i dealt with it okay and to be honest i had a good game we more than that in a minute but from the game very low impact on fantasy wilson bas robinson got an assist he was probably the only asset to come out with points in the game that had impact on fbl himz went off after 70 minutes had two shots 009 xgi so low xgi in the game backtoback blanks for himz now dont think its a major concern and theyve got crystal palace and wolves next so the fixures are still good for him and his owners and although munees is there i think it will take another couple of blanks then you got to start to worry so there is concern particularly if he doesnt get a goal the next two elsewhere inuma is completely anonymous for brenford as an attacking force they were they were just not at the races at all they got the early goal and then they just sat on it and they got what they deserved in a way because they didnt show too much ambition but so very little in the game for fpl managers in the end i came out of it a four points of fle and ill take that and three for bumo ill definitely take that brenford got bournemouth everton and leicester next no clean sheets for fleen there but ill certainly take the four points its just a heartbreak in having had the 12 but 75 points for the game week for me which is which is crazy just what i needed up to 14m a rank gain of 19m which is exactly what i said on blackbox last week i said that although i was having a bad season for rank i always felt this season there were big point swings in it because of the way that the variety of teams and the variation in the heavy hitters and just by playing sano and captain in salah and johnson came in as well as did rogers i had this massive rank climb so im i feel much better about my rank now and ongoing continue to enjoy this season so lets see how it goes from here hope you had a good game week just a bit of injury that came in today canate is fit looks like hes going to be okay so no danger there if you own canate and no appeal for gomez if you were thinking of going that way elsewhere palmer apparently picked up a knee injury from that from that tackle by martinez im that didnt look serious to me but theres theres lots of stories going around about that and also harand picked up a training injury there was something on sky today which is pretty laughable i dont believe a word of that and theyve got the european game coming up so well get it on that well round all that up on blackbox well be back on thursday i think itll be so me and a will be talking then im ive closed the gap on him feel a lot better feel more optimistic hope you do too crazy game week lots more to come hope you like this hit the subscribe button if youre new and if you did like the video hit like and ill see you next
