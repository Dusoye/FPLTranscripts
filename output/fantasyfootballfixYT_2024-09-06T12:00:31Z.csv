hello everybody and welcome back to the fantasy football fix youtube channel my name is fpl phillips and its going to be a week of eddie versus the algorithm where this week during international break were taking a look at wild card drafts but once again its going to be the algorithm team up against my own personal wild card draft that i have put together and to be honest im very close to going for if one more injury or one thing goes wrong during the international break ive made an early transfer my own personal team which if it backfires then ill be hitting the wild card button ive put together their team that im cy on when i will hit the chip i know im losing out on a bit of money but that is the cost of what im going for as im not 100 certain on it but the algorithm has put together its own team using its calculated formulas and all that stuff im very excited to take a look at it hopefully you guys are two to help you with your own personal decision making over this game week for fpl i know the international break is boring but if you could drop a on the video and subscribe down below if you want to stay tuned for more fpl content when the football does eventually return then make sure to do that would be much appreciated but without any further ado lets get into the video shall we and kick things off as always with the algorithm side so we have the algorithm lining up in a 442 for this game week and its not going to be doing that every week of course but for game we 4 its going to be in this formation andc things off with the goalkeeper between the sticks it is going to be dean henderson of crystal palace which i thought is an interesting shout the goalkeeper that i currently own and have been with the majority of his owners rather disappointed with however there is still good justification for him remaining one of the top 45m options hes nailed on keeper for aide that last season had very good defense hes a decent fixture in gw four or be it granted after that theres a bit of a mixed bundle however weve already seen in game week 3 and over the course of last season as well how clean sheets are going to be more difficult to come by this year and if youre going for a 45m option its going to be difficult to expect clean sheets what id be more disappointed with henderson is that him on an individual notes has been quite poor and i think that his xg prevented is not going to be great this year im not sure hes going to make an awful lot of saves i in general dont just rate him as a keeper so if it was sam johnston or someone else that i thought was maybe a bit more capable in goal then it might be a different story at crystal palace if i could back them to make saves someone aeno in goal there would do well i think because be able to keep a lot shots out however henderson just hasnt shown that yet for me from what ive watched the crystal palace let me know if you think otherwise but hes just overall not impressed me on the eye ive not looked at a load of stats with him with regards to that and how he compares to the other 45s but id be more likely to jump on someone maybe just a fleam i know hes got two tricky fixures coming up but if youre looking very long term with this wild card then you do have to look ahead of those next two game weeks and youre not going to want to be making a goalkeeper transfer thats one of the thats probably the position where you least want to use transfers after your wild card and so for me a set for g keeper is very important over 10 or 20 game weeks really if you can look that far on a wild card so for me if youre going with a 45 you could probably look elsewhere from henderson there are some okay rotation options you can go for with him but 45 mil keeper rotation doesnt always work out well for i would just use 55m and go for a more expensive keeper in that bundle which ill explain when we have a look at my side why ive chosen to do that in defense im interested to see who is lining up in this back four we have trent alexander rold rico lewis mitchell and then lukin so some very differential picks in here a few that ive seen mentioned once or twice and then two very popular picks in fpl at the moment tren alexander arnold first and foremost is performing very well has the most has the best expected fpl data if you use the opto stats tool over on fantasy football fix he is top of that and quite some margin ahead of everyone else robertson his teammate only down in fourth and so trends attacking data is looking pretty good albeit he hasnt had those mega holes that will get everyone talking about him over these first few game weeks but i still think that he is a very capable option and one that its difficult to turn away from when liverpool especially are keeping clean sheets trent does start to be able to justify that seven million price tag last season he was what 8m liverpool werent keeping as many clean sheets this season its going to be looking a lot better for him i think its set up well for him to come through with some of those returns whil everyones in a bit of a scramble to maybe getting some of the big guns up front and in midfield maybe ch alexander arnold will come into his own over these next three or four games for liverpool which do look really nice indeed so having an optimal liverpool triple up is probably something that a lot of managers are going to be looking at rico lewis is the one i want to discuss next one has had some controversy around him youve got other competitions starting up for man city and this is going to prove pivotal in the rico lose to barle whether or not he can prove himself for minutes in the premier league really so youre see going to see mixed things i dont think anyone knows for sure even sources who are very you in the know at man city will find it difficult to predict this one and how its going to fit in with kyle walker all i can go off is my opinion based on what ive seen so far this season from pepep and experience of being trolled by him in the past but rico le has been trusted with a lot so far this season a lot more than weve seen in any previous campaign and its unsurprising really hes a young player coming through and he has looked exceptional and if this is anything to go on i think that lewis is going to remain a very good option for the rest of the season hes already up at 46m and he looks very attacking when hes on the pitch everyones talking about how you vs tucking in rico lewis is the one advancing making those runs getting into those advanced areas where hes picking up some good underlying expected data hes already rattled the crossbar hes hes had a lot of chances and i think hes going to come good and to be honest at that price point for a man city defender i think its worth it where theres not too many other 45m options shining in defense right now if youve got the bench i think you can afford to take the punt and so this team presumably does have that was the other sides i think will have that as well i think rico lewis is worth a money personally and i would have him in on a wild card draft lets say that the other two of very interesting pick theres a double up on crystal palace defense with mitchell which i would definitely not be justifying based on what ive seen so far from them anyway he has been getting forward a lot mitchell i still dont think hes a better pick than muno all things considered and so im a bit confused as why hes in here he has been picked i think by the algorthm team once in the past so maybe theres a bit of a liking to him maybe hell come good in this leicester fixture but as mention there a bit of a mix bag for crystal palace up next so im interested by that pick and then luca dean at aston villa is interesting one as i have seen things from villa fans claiming that they want matson to start hes obviously assigning that they spent 440m p on in the summer i assumed he was going to come in and be first choice at some point just didnt know when that point is would it be game week two would it be game we one but theyve waited at least three game weeks at aston villa and i think maybe game we four could be the one and either way i think youve just got a bit of a ticking time bomb with luca dean one that you maybe dont want if youve got other defenders rico lewis in granted l in is a pretty cheap option hes on my however forever fpl trolls list and for that reason can never step foot anywhere near my team a total logic totally logical reason for never picking the guy again but he has just proven himself to be an fpl troll and i dont trust him to do anything else but troll down the line to be honest as well so saying that i think youre going to get an early sub from him every game if he does start so not that much potential for attacking returns but baston villa do have a good set of fixtures coming up next he could grab some attacking returns of course during those first 60 minutes but if youre looking just for the clean sheets anyway then im not sure why you wouldnt just go for someone a coner whos more assured for minutes okay lucine might go off and then villa could concede and you could get a clean sheet bang that way but i just dont think its worth the risk when youve got someone a lewis in the side as well in particular it just doesnt make too much sense to me and so for that reason i wouldnt be owning lucine right now in midfield were going to see muhammad salah e diego jot and then morgan rogers a midfield that i really do the look of i think salah is going to be on every wild card team really i think if anyones going to choose to drop one of harland or salah most teams are choosing to drop earning harand right now which you def fixes and everything that liverpool have a fantastic three games coming up and i think the optimal triple up therefore the algorithm thinks liverpool is salah trent and jot which is interesting diego jot has impressed me quite a lot during those first three weeks maybe less so last time out against man utd which was a bit disappointing as an owner of the man when luis diaz is shining off the left wing it makes it all the more painful but shter has still been very good we need to not forget that really hes going to be an early sub every game or not really early but around that 70 75 minute mark for darwin nunes with gakpo coming on off the left wing so hes still one that i think will come good and will get points its just whether he will find the form that weve seen salah and lu diaz at the moment hitting so far over these first few game weeks but he has got returned and lets not say that he hasnt been missing chances as well hes had at least two from trent over those first two game weeks that he could have put away and he could be on a higher amount of points than lis diaz and people would be debating that a lot more than maybe they are theres a bit of speculation around international duty and all that stuff so maybe keep an eye on that if youre going for liverpool options j and diaz in particular but yeah those are my two cents on the issues i think you cant really go wrong with or diaz if one of those is your third liverpool option alongside trent and salah i think youve got a very good lineup there and then weve got e and morgan rogers as the other two midfielders i knew e would come good i said it last game week ill say it again hes going to be a fantastic fpl pick over the course of this season he got extremely unlucky over the first two game weeks i cant believe anyone sold him let alone the fact that he got a price drop and lo and behold he came good in game week three against chelsea he was a fantastic pick from the start hes got leicester at home up next i dont really think it matters too much who crystal palace are playing if theyre going to score goals and as is going to be involved in a hell of a lot of them and then morgan rogers who is yet to come good but has been putting up chances for oe watkins on an absolute plate hes going to be the best option at 55 or 54m and below that you can go for and so picking him up for ason vills fixure run seems a bit of a nobrainer up front were going to see erling harand come into the team and kai h as the second forward which is very interesting we got vet down there on the bench as well who will come in for weeks where brenford arent playing man city and presumably lucin or lewis or mitchell whichever one fix to base will drop down onto the bench so i quite the look of that front seven im a big fan indeed surprising to go for vissa over embo is not something you see the algorithm team do too much but yeah kai havs is a very good pick and one that i quite back as cover for that arsenal forward line at least up until gw six where they fixes turn a little bit for the better and he can consider maybe moving in someone a sacker or maybe a defensive option then so lets have a look at my team and how it compares im aware this video is already over 11 minutes long so lets make sure we have a look at my team as well all briefly okay so here is my side it doesnt look that similar at all really ive made one big sacrifice in this team that i dont making and its trent down to robertson to save a million and i did need this million to get in the other attackers that i wanted and i know ive said a lot about trent attacking data being very impressive but robertsons look decent as well both of them seem to be getting subbed off at varying points in the game i think connor bradley is one that theyre going to want to give more minutes to and hence trent is more likely to be subbed earlier and so on the one hand you might get clean sheets that again might get wiped out in that maybe 10 minute spell between where trent and robertson get subbed off at max but on the other hand youve got more potential for attacking returns with trent on the pitch for more minute so thats what youre going to want as a trent owner and were not really seeing him get 90 so far this season i think thats going to be something that continues dare i say no matter how many stops trent decides to throw and so im not seeing the upside there as much as maybe he would have in previous years i know trent can easily get returns maybe even two in the first 70 minutes of a match but for me i just think that million does make a big difference to the rest of the side so ive decided to go with robo over trent ive still with rico lewis for me reasons mentioned prior ive gone with robinson who is a player a big advocate for since game week one and then davis of ipswitch on the bench whos got great attacking data has been playing very far forward very advanced one that was talked about a lot in preseason was just not picked by anyone basically due to ips whichs first two opening games where you werent going to be able to start him against liverpool and man city and then muscara as a 40 mil defender ive gone with reyer in goal as my 55 mil keeper of choice now you could go with allison in this side however i want to leave that third liverpool slot open for if they are scoring so many goals that it seems inevitable to want a triple up on the reds ive gone with ry for now just to carry him into that good fixture run that starts game week six as i think that from there on out arsenal are going to keep a fair amount of clean sheets and even in these next two games could be a clean sheet or two in it for them they have historically done very well even in big matches where they tend to play a little bit more off the off the front foot on the back foot shut up shop and defend very well arsenal in my view at least last season the midfield looks pretty similar three of the same assets in here and then ive got seeno and mumo as my twoos to complete my five seeno granted bournemouth have tricky fixtures over the next two as well and this is another reason why im hesitant to use my own wild card and buo has man city zeno has chelsea up next i think zenos got then got a tricky fixture next game week too but i think these are two players who are going to get 90 minutes for their side every week seeno likely to be on penalties maybe evan nson whos coming could be on them and bumo we know for short is definitely on penalties and its the same principle with a where youre looking for a player whos a bit of a talisman in their team involved in a lot of the play could or is on penalties and is just involved in an awful lot is going to get 90 minutes as said so yeah thats my justification behind going for those three and then up front weve got another penal penalty taker in ja pedro have havs as well i think for reasons ive mentioned prior and then earling harlen so youre going to be rotating that front eight again in this team with davis lewis and robinson rotating in the defense and yeah thats going to about wrap up my wild card draft and what im looking at going for currently so let me know down below in the comments guys do you think my team is better or do you think the algorithm wild our team is better im interested to know what you guys think down below as mentioned at the start of the video if you did enjoy then make sure to leave a thumbs up it really does help us out here at the channel and yeah other than that ill wish you guys a good rest of your day take it easy and goodbye
