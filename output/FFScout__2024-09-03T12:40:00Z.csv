fantasy football related comments okay lets have a look see how you going on in game week three ive got your team up on the screen good week 81 points and youre youve got a green arrow youre up to 18m after well i say tricky st but everyones doing really well at the moment yeah it didnt it didnt feel i a bad start but it felt but it wasnt as highight and as good as some that ive seen so it was middling i think but 18m it feels were slowly starting to climb into a respectable rank hopefully thatll be achieved in the next few weeks yeah so that youre pretty much probably averaging about 70 points a week so far if someone said to me at the beginning of the season oh youre going to average around 70 points a week ill take that yeah but yeah so but yeah weve been both ed by harand salah etc some high performance so ive got a team up on the screen do you want to just read out the team and just highlight any either problem areas and also those that youre very happy with yeah sure so well start the back and go forward so i had henderson in goal who got four points away at chelsea which exceeded my expectations after a disappointing couple of weeks for henderson but yeah i felt content with that at the back i had the clean sheet from alexander arnold he threatened a mega hall didnt he at old trafford but still happy with that kza got two lost the clean sheet at leicester robinson got four another assist happy with that sacka got six rogers which was my transfer in last week only got two e 10 smith row two and then the front line was monit 2 harland as my captain 34 and isack 9 and on the bench bentley porro mina and quano okay yeah so the key things there is patience rewarded with eay when we would we look at underlying stats each week look at the games as well and yeah there was there was no way that he was going to stay not scoring isach as well good goal from him there you ive also got mint on my bench game week four brighton have the first of two home games not only forest nip switch which is a very nice pair of fixtures there so yeah im assuming minty minate will come in yeah this is what we i think we both did this didnt we joe with the smith row m rotation and yeah im happy now that he can come in bench smith row which well come on to a bit later it feels a nice use of fs and taking advantage of their better fixtures yeah definitely i me i also doubled up with robinson and b barco is obviously now alone if i if id have had the money i would have gone for dunk obviously but that would have been good so i would have i that rotation first few weeks especially brighton also rotate quite well with brenford going forward lets have a look at game weeks four and five so whats ive got the fixtures up on the screen but before i do that whats your general plan are youre going to while card in game week six perhaps yeah that was my plan when i built the team in game week one and im sticking to that i think because dont have any arsenal players dont have any brenford assets players fleing and but and bomo look really good in six so yeah the plan is to wild card in six so this table is particularly good for me because it is simply focusing on the next two weeks and ive got two free transfers to use in that time okay this shows in game weeks four and five so if you are wild card in game six or even if youre not but youre just looking for the next two game weeks brighton the top ipswitch in gw four ninghan forest in game week five both at home ipswitch themselves are considered quite high but they got brighton away obviously and then sampton away crystal palace couple of home fixtures not as easy but pretty good still leicester at home man utd at home sampton man utd at home ipswitch at home so there lots of teams with two good home fixtures aston villa going well everton and wolves two home fixtures there liverpool nottingham forest and bournemouth both at home as well and further down though brenford arsenal bournemouth nottingham forest tottenham and man city and havent got the best pair of fixtures in there so if you wanted to move off there so with this in mind whats your immediate thought for because you dont have salah at the moment for example what your immediate thought with your team and the transfers you might make yeah well i think thats the immediate concern no liverpool attack for not only gw four for forest but in gw five when harland isnt going to be the default captain because hes obviously got arsenal so i need to get myself into that liverpool attack but i feel fairly well covered with everything else you look at brighton and ive got mt come in this week from palace there up there ive got henderson and from villa ive got konu and rogers got alexander arnold in so i feel fairly well covered so i think my transfer this week will be a liverpool attacker which we come on to in a bit game week five ill probably have a bit of fun with that one its that its that roll of the dice isnt it before your wild card yeah and i could potentially take out harland that week if i if i wanted to which would free up some funds yeah have you got how many transfers have you got for this for game we four just one just the one yeah i went in with the two and earlier in the week i interviewed mark fpl general he got three i was quite jealous yeah i think it depends who you started with and how lucky you got with that i had i got the salan injury i had to get onunu out last week he was i think hes gone down what is it to 62 or three now so yeah envious of the people whove managed to stock up yeah my thinking i got harland also in gw five i hes certainly not the captain of ball or necessary but yeah i was thinking of yeah i could remove him to say watkins for example but i would lose some value because hes gone up to 152 so i would have to buy him back more i would lo lose out there so its he just weighing up that whether that 01 or so is or whether i would prefer the chance of perhaps watkins points but probably a good chance in a in a set well talk about aston villa is watkins worth getting yeah so lets have a look at game week six as well quickly because this is when you might wild card im thinking about that as well fpl general is thinking that as well some other content creators ive seen are if you are watching this and youre wild carding now absolutely fine im going to be doing a wild card game week four wild card draft video this week i think itll be out this weekend and if you want to hold your wild card thats absolutely fine so if youre seeing people me and tom or whoever were all saying wild card six it does do dont think you have to wild card in game six its totally team defendent dependent and with my team toms team and others it just feels right and this shows why because for us is the fixtures change so suddenly brighton who weve got players with so the fixtures arent so good they got chelsea tottenham newcastle wolves liverpool man city its a poor run right up to game we 11 theyre bottom newcastle theyre in our teams they got city and arsenal and chelsea all within that period as well and brighton obviously tough one chelsea they moved down so chelsea are in a lot of squads but whilst they do have brighton and ndam forest at home six and seven its game week eight liverpool tricky newcastle man utd arsenal really tough run there meanwhile brenford and bomo visa lots of options there west ham bowen certainly someone ive got my eye on in my wild card brenford ipswitch nottingham forest and everton all within that next six after game week six so yeah i looked at this and just thought i am not geared up for this fixture change at all so need to walk on yeah i think im exactly the same joe i think that arsenal are quite low down on that but those immediate f leicester southampton at home bournemouth away i think youre going to want at least two arsenal players for that potentially three and then have a plan to move them on maybe when the fixtures get a bit tougher although there could be goals in that liverpool home game and newcastle and chelsea away so just keeping them is absolutely fine too so i think that havs i the look of him sacker and a defender we spoke about brenford bomo absolutely coming in on penalties for that run flecking as well looks good i love boeing i kilman as well hes looked good in the first few weeks good for bonus and as well everton not looking good at the moment but mikeno has dropped to 44 could be a nice enabler for that run if you just need a cheap defender so theres theres a few options there and i think just for my team that makes most sense yeah another issue my team as well ive got barco and quanza and yeah somehow muddled through the first three game weeks im going to go for another week or two with them and i cant carry that i cant carry that weight too long yeah ill come a cropper lets have aston villa so ive got a table up on the screen look ive sorted this by expected goal involvement it includes things chances created shots on target also minutes per baseline bonus which is the metric m minutes per baseline bonus point system which is the metric used to calculate bonus points basically the lower the score theyre the more frequent theyre picking up these metrics for the for the bonus and the better they are for bonus watkins is top of this in terms of expect goal involvement no goals yet three starts two shots on target hes got an assist yeah hes 89 now hes taken a dip still great fixtures he just didnt do it against leicester but his bonus minutes per baseline bonus points are awful its every 36 minutes so whats going on there with watkins for people me you whoever dont have him might want to get him in gw four or five is he is he worth getting in well i think the reason firstly why that is so low is because of these big chances hes missed and hes missed i think its four this season he certainly missed two against arsenal and at least one against leer he doesnt feel hes 100 fit at the moment and i wrote about this last week and i still recommended him as a transfer him because i think that is going to the more training he gets the sharper hes going to become but hes getting subbed off quite early and it was i think 61 minutes at the weekend he obviously played a lot well played quite a bit of the euros he didnt have a preseason at all he didnt play one friendly for us and i think the fact that john durans playing or making such an impact off the bench thats quite an easy change for emory to make to try and swing the momentum in our favor if we start to go a bit stale and thats what happened at leer and durant comes on and gets that all important second goal for us so thats a of a concern i dont think durans going to start over him yet but i think the champions league kicking in i think if you do own him youre going to have to accept that it might not be it wont be the watkins of last season when youre get 90 minutes week in week out okay so i for those wanting to tap into asen villas good fixtures watkins 89 there might be better options there but its n nana i put in brackets not andre because of his famous press conference where he insisted hes not andre yeah he i dont know hes the i dont know dour or something its that player the player thats hows he scoring hes got two goals two shots on target starting every game hes got hes he has created a chance as well and hes very strong with baseline bonus but hes hes hes a central defensive m he shouldnt be there but he well yeah he is he is deeper he sometimes he sl into the defensive line when i went to seeing him against arsenal a couple of weeks ago but he will sometimes tians will sit and thatll allow him to break into the box but its mainly setpiece threat thats what youre getting from anana weve got austin mcfa set pieces for us hes very creative youve seen both his goals so far have been from set pieces and thats where the threat i think you can do better and i think that i know that hes outscoring rogers but rogers would be the superior picker yeah so hes a such for those who enjoyed suchs points a couple of couple of seasons ago in that role as in he might get you some setpiece goal but essentially hes not going to be in the box all the time yeah exactly that joe yeah hes not hes not quite as advanced as s either in an open play jacob ramsey k has come on yeah no starts but he has created three chances had a couple of shots on target from limited minutes and very strong baseline bonus as well which might be reflective limited minutes but yeah what is he going to start yeah whats situation with him hes only 55 he might do now because bay has picked up this hamstring injury which so ramsey replaced him at the weekend mcin switched flanks that created the role on the left for ramsay hes a really good asset its just minutes with ramsey and we need to know that hes securing this team and we need to find out how long baile is going to be out for first but he could become a factor in our season at some point ramsey but its a bit too soon at the moment i think okay jan as well you mentioned as well hes hes on that latest evidence hes probably going to get you about 30 40 minutes in games but he hes got a couple of goals shots on target three so he could be a an okay for the for the gambler you hes not going to start but him against tied legs last 30 minutes is clearly doing the business yeah he makes a real impact off the bench i dont think theres many players that score as many goals coming on as a sub as he does a few fans have heard murma saying oh we should start the next game against everton because hes been playing better than watkins i dont see that personally i think the best thing for villa is to get watkins up to speed as quick as possible and benching isnt going to help him with that wouldnt wouldnt surprise me if he got a start further down the line with champions league around maybe but i think again its its too soon because y got 30 minutes at the weekend but that could be 15 20 minutes in other games at the moment so i think its just one to monitor for now i think if you own watkins keep him theres no i think hes going to start the games and home against everon next thats a good fixture yeah for duran just monitor it okay next name telman six chances created i i thought hes looked you as a villa fan me as a neutral he looks the best but as a player yeah he looks good is he on penalties whos on penalties well we dont know yet and thats going to be the key for tians if he is on penalties then that suddenly elevates him up to a level above what he is at the moment hes taken some corners with he shared them with bailey recently they so you got a bit of setpiece route to assists via that hes playing in this pivot with anana sometimes he sits sometimes he goes forward a little bit but hes quite stable in the middle if he gets pins then well talk about him until we know if thats going to happen i dont i dont think bother if he emerges as the main penalty taker when im wild cy on gw six even though the fixture run starts to pet up but next six astonvilla have everton wolves but then they still still good ips switch man utd fulham bournemouth i would be tempted to get villas penalty taker in at 55 if it is him over i dont mind that over the next player rogers 51 hes been the darling of the twitterati five chances created looked good pass the eye test pass the underlying stats test ish hes got one shot on target yeah so is what is that the issue with him in respective of price hes obviously good for 51 but yeah is he just a lot of running and perhaps not the goal scorer we hope well his roles changed a bit this year because hes playing in behind watkins and i think what weve seen quite a few times is he receives the ball he links that midfield and attack drives forward with the ball lays it off either a through ball for watkins or to one of the wide players he should have had two assists in the past two week if watkins was sharper he would have come out with six assist points from that were probably not even having this conversation he will assist more than score i think im sure of that but i just think i cant get him hes 51 hes nailed in this team at the moment good fixtures coming up he will score im sure and i think i just think hes hes absolutely fine for this one of fixtures it feels a return is brewing and hes been a bit unlucky so far do you think he would stay on your wild card potentially because all the all the fear for me was we went out inside and new number 10 we didnt do that so hes in the driving seat for that position now m absolutely loves him he was only saying before the weekend he doesnt think he should be called up to the england under 21s he said hes an england international now that shows you how highly he speaks of them or thinks of them and i think at 51 getting into what be a top six attack come the end of the year yeah ive got no problem keeping him yeah he certainly
