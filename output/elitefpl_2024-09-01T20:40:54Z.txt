all right lets go im running away from the past i behind looking for answers but im blinded by the l in i st night promise ill be in the morning out of out of my snow out of sight and out of mind snow out of sight and out of mind just for tonight let your thought be free just for tonight you come with me just for tonight the get just for tonight so out of sight and out of mind just for tonight come with me blindly you keep running but your legs are standing still its youre stuck in nightmare but you doing it for the well this is reality you only live it once wake up from your dreams but just for t thees free just for tonight free just for hello good evening guys good evening so out of sight and out of snow out of sight and out of mind yeah hi i guess look the intro was different because today is for me its a somber day for football muhammad salah coming around and punishing so many fpr man honestly i dont even want to be here right now to be honest i really dont i said steo just do a solo mate just do a solo what have i got why would i want to relive the events of today i dont want to i watched that game today and it was just ive had bad moments as a united fan but oh my god and then and then to the icing on the cake the icing on the cake in that game they take off arguably our best player in garnacho tenh hark and they leave rashford on and i havent seen mark goldbridge and im pretty damn sure mark goldbridge has talked about it and this isnt about united this is about fpl but i am absolutely furious at ten hog and i want him gone he needs to go he hasnt got a clue has not got a clue the players are completely clueless as to what theyre meant to be doing in the team casamero i just i dont know its its almost hes its not just his legs that have gone but his ability to read the game has gone you get these world class players steo theyve played all their careers theyve reached the top of their game won champions leagues their legs start to go but at least at least theyve still got their head and they canot anticipate and they can still work things out and they can make up for the fact theyre not fast because they can read the game and maybe intercept and standoff players no he was his touch was terrible his vision was nonexistent what the hell he was trying to do playing the pool out getting it was he was in treal he was he was stuck in treal and he just couldnt move and the united defense was exposed though time and time again and again this isnt about united but literally the fact is im here to talk about football and the first thing i want to talk about is that shower of that was man united versus liverpool h and liverpool fans out there youre watching i know youre watching you cant say you played very well you cant say you were really on top of your game it was handed you on the plate it was absolutely handed you on the plate it was embarrassing you didnt even have to work to score a goal the amount of chances liverpool had where they created themselves and fudged it up i lost count but every single time united fudged up liverpool was there to pay basically to pick him off what am i trying to say what im trying to say is remove the mistakes in that game from united that games ending nil salah was very good dont get me wrong the ball over the top to the back post was very good but that came from a mistake came from a mistake all right and ten hog needs to go he needs to go hes not shown hes three games in and im already saying he needs to go hes showing absolutely no sign that hes learning from the lessons of last season keeping rashford on keeping staying with casemiro for as long as he did bruno fernandez thats one good thing at least i transferred him out i suppose but its just embarrassing its it gets to the point as a united fan and i love man united i really do its embarrassing seeing the fans booing i dont that i think thats not i i understand why theyre doing it but i dont its embarrassing but its embarrassing from a united fan because its almost the whole of the premier league of mocking us because the whole of the premier league knows whats wrong i can see whats wrong but united dont seem to be fixing the problems so and so many issues to solve out anyway im going to read h everyone in the chat yeah so much for so much for casmir having a great season looking his best jason got a laugh yeah i predicted that didnt i second half it was liverpool sto playing yeah its 30 lets be honest liverpool could have subbed off their whole first 11 and brought on their kids and the game would have still won it still would have ended 30 and i dont and no slave scaro can play 90 minutes mate gacho can play 90 minutes there none his crap something is in ten has head saying ive got to keep marcus rashford on the left and its not all marcus rashs fault its not marcus rashs fault its not all down to him the end of the day its the person that chooses him to play i do agree with that and he doesnt look interested the amount of times the ball gets fed down the left hand side to mark rashford what does he do he turns back around and he plays it back to one of the midfielders or back to the defender im sorry but if youre a winger and youre youre hugging that left hand touch line and you get given the ball your job is to take on that fullback and get to the by line and try and whip a ball in or do what he used to do and try and cut in into the box and create a goal scoring opportunity which he was good at doing two seasons ago but what do you do steo if you got a player thats banging out a form and he hasnt been doing anything for multiple months what were talking 14 15 months steo youre a manager you got a player youve given him a chance youve given him a chance right everyone all the fans are on the back going time to drop him you got players on the fringes want to come in you got you got talented youngsters coming through what you do steo if you got a player thats that was in the first 11 thats no longer performing or doing anything for the team not tracking back not performing any positive actions for the team what do you do steo as a manager you pretty much dropping right and what manager how many managers badges have you got shiff leader at tesco okay yeah so its just its just embarrassing anyway moving on hello to dread fpl to john hey hello to scott scotland vester le bonil is here men and blacks here alex is here clickers is here dans here second oh yeah pk 7s here i its just yeah what day for fpl for me anyway steo im done talking now for the rest of the stream you can go ahead and take it take it away i dont think its been a bad day for you had two out of your four players returned today jackson and e oh come on jackson got yellow card hes hes still scored hes still got one bonus point ill ill be honest with you jay i ive hit the wild card i had to get rid of a lot of dead wood in my team and after watching today ive decided that i cannot go without go without salah no that if anybody in the first three game weeks predicted howand and salah to have exactly the same points yeah there are people that can take a guess that i think that this salah will outperform hen by this amount or whatever but the way the way these worldclass freaks of nature have come through with double digit triple digit quadruple digit halls is absurd the goals that were scored today by liverpool absolutely perfect oh yeah they were but im sorry they were they were they were taken wild goals yeah on a g but on a given but on a given game week theyre not going to be gifted that many chances no and this is this is exactly the point salahs goal that he scored just pinpoint accuracy the same as diazs first one or was it the second one no it was the second one wasnt it was it the header he scored it was the first one wasnt it the header second i cant remember now that was the second goal that was the second was it so the first one absolute pinpoint accuracy same as salahs one as well the header by diaz absolute perfection dont get me wrong diaz of the of the front three for liverpool obviously number one is s diaz is by far number two slot only took him off to be im just going to give you a rest mate youve performed so well today if im a diego j owner which im not anymore id be seriously concerned about him oh yeah good point i think that even though i still believe by gw four hes still going to be number one i think nunes and gapo are gonna have something to say about shter diaz and salah are not going anywhere now that other bloke who theyve signed i dont know what his name is he aint going to be taking salahs spot hes gonna be coming on for salah its exact is what i was saying to dan about sterling hell be coming in for sacka sterling aint gonna be starting any matches and to see salah return the exact same points as hen when in history jaay can you think when players of high captaincy are getting such a high return and then the second highest owned captaincy returns exactly the same i cannot think its an fbl dream isnt it for people that own both players essentially its its just been an amazing start i think 1819 season and who did that involve that was the season where it was the template was doing amazing it was it was the it was a season where i did really well it was the season where andy robertson trent were just scoring ridiculous points every week out outc mendy yeah outscoring it was the it was the one it was that one season where you had rees james as well reese james was bagging in the points it was it was just ridiculous the template was coming through almost every week for about six game weeks in a row for the first six seven game weeks it was oh my god i think game week w 101 point 101 points or 104 points game week two 118 points it was whoa this ive never played fpl this before this is ridiculous but yeah people who own people who own salah and harland are pulling away youre talking 40 50 points now clear of rivals in their mini leagues because they are its not its not that bad for people that dont for people that dont own against people that dont own them well people that dont own either i nick turner yeah hes hes destroy yeah thats what thats what im saying im saying people that dont own because there are people that have gone out there and be what im going to be clever and there was a person and i dont know what it was and it was a person on sunday surgery and im doubtful well see them ever again cuz they didnt have salah harland in their team we dont even see operators mate so are we going to see so theyre theyre probably never going to come back into the show again because they didnt have sal harand and obviously theyre not no im joking okay come back on h we would have lov to hear from you we probably b carded you wont but well anyway theres an old saying in it hit the wild card in game week youll be happy is that saying god i feel good jaay i generally feel really good hitting the wild needed to be done i had such the dead wood in my team is as well i might have to i might do that as well to be honest because ive got ive got so much to sort out in my team now look at me ive got barco hall ive got johnson whos not even playing ive got anderson whos getting replaced by keer no but no but no seriousness of de kevin de bruyer the best midfielder the premier league has ever seen get me one point anyway ill clip that for tik tok can we can we just yeah smash that button subscribe to the channel if you it around here jump on our discord discs full of yeah a very friendly place people should be hitting the button and subscribe but no you should be smashing it smashing that button yeah because it gives us gives us that derve and determination to carry on such ive decided to give myself a handicap this week hold on nick we you we were just slagging you off mate we were literally just slagging you off so yeah hes just in all seriousness are you genuinely tempted to hit the world yeah mate i am of course i am look at the state of it no its so better than your team oh well hold on a minute i only had some dead wood but i needed to do it for the price changes these are f oh the price changes oh the price changes oh well we shall b to the price changes of fpl w betide we dont have the players in before they go up in value because well never well never catch up to our leag hold on its more the fat players going down that im concerned about in my team gordon isaac to name two i cant i cant allow them to drop to be bringing in players that i want and the original plan was going to be doing pedro in for munes and then i was going to be doing hoping that somehow i could get in trent alexander arnold if not id be bringing in robertson but i realized newcastle are absolutely atrocious they make man united look man city newcastle are absolutely pants jaay how they won today is beyond me tells me more about tottenham than it does about newcastle i have to get rid of gordon hes gonna be dropping down in price tonight isaacs another one that looks hes going to be dropping down in price tonight newcastle useless i had le hall who will not be playing for newcastle ever again apart from in the carib cup and the fa cup you then have johnson who as you quite rightly say isnt playing and im thinking right i need to be bringing in some of these players that are really doing let me just bring your team up very quickly because i ive just realized ive got mine up one second put my wild card team up if you want oh you posted it have you ive put it in discord teams team yeah team can you say can you can you say that again i put it in teen disc hell i speak another language i have put it in there and im pretty much waiting on watkins to i see i see you put it in tco dts im waiting on a watkins hoping for a double price drop which is unlikely hes going to go down in price tonight but im hoping for a double because then i can then bring in watkins for hs im gutted i cant bring in sacka i really wanted to bring in sacka but i cant i said to fog that i really liked his team and i think double liverpool defense watching him today i know it was man united but even the last three fixtures theyve got a system there which is not allowing anybody to score whatsoever there was quite clearly two clear chances where united almost had open goals to score yeah in any match and even if youre playing everton youre going to get an opportunity but their goalkeeper in allison the player that i had last season that did absolutely nothing for me same as virgil van djk this season i think theyve had more clean sheets so far this season than when i owned them for the whole of last season thats how bad it was for me i dont mind dont hate that team i think its i dont its all right yeah do you want to read out to the to the martinez in goal lewis robertson alexander arnolds is back three bremo diaz pal and sos and midfield four and then with a trio of havitz j pedro and harland up front i cant see a bench your bench is let me read it out 3 2 1 fabianski and goal rogers robinson and greaves so nice cheapy bench yeah and this isnt knee jerky these are players in which says these are players in which are fantastic value for their positions i said ha will become watkins if watkins goes down by 02 again unlikely you never know im happy with havs to be completely frank its a brilliant player he is performing miracles along with sacker i dont know what combination theyve got going but these two are just on fire and im happy to own him if i dont if i dont have watkins because watkins as we discussed yesterday isnt exactly pulling up trees pedro great brighton asset brightons fixtures are absolutely phenomenal moving forward hen dont need to disc seeno is the interesting one for me jay seeno his performances for bournemouth have been apparently he performed really well yesterday as well and their upcoming fix just chelsea at home i dont have the problem with that at all dan will be going to that liverpool away hell be benched for that but then they got southampton leicester in game week six and seven thank you arsenal at home forget it astonvilla away forget it man city forget it but those three fixtures chelsea southampton leicester can easily play dont have the problem with that whatsoever cuz fulham i still think by all accounts smith row wasnt particularly great yesterday i still think hes binging beding in and seeno is i believe on penalties as well and burm brenford fixtures once again i dont think he is rico lewis tell me about it is he is he nailed yeah oh hell be playing for no matter what hell be playing and if i feel that he isnt nailed ive got robinson as back up and gre greaves is a starting ip switch defender hes four million and what their fixtures upc coming if absolutely in desperate mode theyre not that bad up sal salah being 126 is a pain in the ass yeah im im happy to go with the triple liverpool in robertson trent and diaz those two look so dangerous i did not tempted of people doing diego jot diaz and tr yeah i had that i genuinely had diego jot and diaz but i just thought j today i didnt think played that particularly great there was a moment when he was put through and he should have and he and he took it on this on the left hand side he did really well got into the box and all he had to do was just square it to whoever it was he didnt bother he tried to take it on himself and i can imagine slot just thinking its been a few times now that you could have hit the i dont know hit the target with a with a shot or whatever but hes not put it on target or in this specific case he could have just simply squar the ball i cant i dont know what minute jot came off it must have been the 75th minute or something i know diaz went off first but im im i can see diaz so far forward hes he for me is the one thats getting furthest forward out of the out of jotter and salah and do you remember this conversation was it last year or the year before when we were talking about a particular player being maybe more of a an assist rather than a goal scorer was it salah we were talking about was it somebody else there was somebody that we said could be more of the assist because theyve got a better quality of striker ahead of them i cant remember who it was now and i see that in salah yeah you said it was about salah didnt you i think it was when was it nunes was coming in honest i cannot remember will be all and then obviously that you jinxed him because then he ended up being an absolute fail yes so im look if i could get sal team i would but there are certain players i want to get in which i just cant sacka being one of them now the plan will be is to potentially be getting rid of palmer for sacka in gw six and seven however i am very tempted very tempted by around the gw six mark to possibly move on haland possibly their fixtures game week five arsenal at home newcastle the way then they got fulham wolf southampton its almost committing a sin so actually looking at that im not going to be doing that whatsoever i think thats just absolute madness now thinking about it now looking at there but trying to get sacarin the only way i can do it is by getting in palmer and palmers fixture proof along with the liverpool boys same as in burma i think a buros pretty much fix approve his fixtures themselves in brenford man city away they always give up opportunities spurs away he i think i think brentfords got a really good record against spurs actually west ham at home wolves at home man united away i switch at home sil at home these are beautiful fixtures youre not obviously not interested in onis son then anymore tottenham again i did not see anything from tottenham whatsoever where i think oh my god i wish i own that player who was it on the i think it was mark goldbridge he said the problem with tottenham is that they need this is why they need salanki up front and until we see salanki consistently for tottenham i cant make a decision on how son madison johnson koseski will fit around salanki whatsoever or od de bear nowadays so suns always guaranteed to play we know this but ive not seen ill continue saying this sun getting those two goals against everton was very fortuitous very fortuitous and tottenham so far what they won one game against everton 40 they drew the opening day 11 with leicester when they should have been at least two n up at halim and then they lose today 21 to an absolute abject newcastle team that literally looked they cannot be bothered to play now dont get me wrong isaac in the opening what was it the only five minutes 10 minutes he did a deliberate cross come shot just trying to chip the goalkeeper an inch lower hes scoring it isaac could have come away with a double digit hall today yeah but and bremo a city away next fixture you just playing him playing i couldnt care less its either him or rogers at home to everton but its literally a toss of a coin between them two to be completely frank it really doesnt bother me whatsoever you said rogers is five million whatever yeah whereas and burma hes on penalties brenford are going to set up with that what was it what was it when theyre away from home they play a 532 or something that i cant remember now or a 442 i cant quite remember what it is but theyll be trying to hit city on the counter but again thatll be just a decision that i make on the day but we got two weeks now two weeks chase two weeks to be mulling over but i think that youre probably going to end up wild carding again youre going to be ending up wild carding now how likely are you going to wild card because i think youre about 98 there im not going to lie mate im looking at this team im and again a lot of its i have to agree with you looking at the value that some of these players bring some of them annoyingly a lot have gone up in value but for example hang on very good luke i i the office reference there very good very fleen what do you think of fleen well this is the thing for me i was really tempted to do what fires done which is a fleen and vuan rotation pairing you got you got martinez which got some really nice fixtures well this is the thing i need that aston villa coverage but flecking and ver bruan it is a really good double up and really good if you look at it youve got the bruan has brighton at home sorry ip switch at home first then its notting the forest at home and then you can just go to fleen where hes got west h wolves at home then you go to then you can keep oh yeah until brighton and then theyve got brighton and nip switch they i am very invested in that and theres a small possibility it may end up with me getting rid of martinez getting rid of robinson doing the fleen and ver bruan and conza in for robinson instead but the good thing the good thing jace with this gw four wild card is that there i personally think theres going to be quite a few assets going down in price and thats why i want to just do a world card now get the players in that i want because and burmas going up in price tonight diaz is im im im looking at this here and im im looking at what i can do okay lets hear it and im almost ready to share with you mate just share it because its just hang on im nearly there im just need to find one five a five million or i does he need to be five million defender it depends who your starting defenders are in what formation well be itll be alexander arnold right lewis yeah and you dont know who the other 45 i dont know well i got thinking of daa maybe not a bad shout dena hes not gonna play hes hes gonna be slowly out really yeah de deor isnt gonna be a star i dont think for aston villa i could be completely wrong which normally i am but de chat yeah chat yeah this is what this is the good thing is chat can tell us well is walker not going to take lss place says luke in the chat no walker when he came on yesterday didnt take over lewiss spot lewis is a versatility man i think pet gua is is absolutely loving lewis and his development and i dont see any reason why pet would drop him hes done nothing wrong if anything hes i dont see much i dont see much in value of five million or under defenders i really dont no but you said it doesnt have to be five million doesnt it doesnt have to be five million what do you mean well im looking at budget defenders i dont see a lot of great value in i dont see okay you got robinsons gone up in valley which is annoying that is annoying but whats your team as it stands right now what wild card okay so itd be so ill do the i the i dont i the vgan fleen so just put that there for the moment and they got lewis alexander arnold daa but that could be someone else diaz e jota and bremo say that again diaz e jot and bromo hav watkins harand watkins holland havs watkins and harand oh you would have right okay and who are your budget three players in defense and midfield it be rogers yeah johnson well john you can replace him with gre oh yeah sorry yeah who he plays for rips which is the zack of the same team but hes a guarante hes a center back guaranteed i got two 45m players to bring in for two defenders 45m im thinking of maseri just have man united cover dont you and maybe leis dunk is that too much having for bren and dunk no i dont think so this would be my team ill stick up on the screen in fact ill put in the discord team screenshots for you to see steo five 4 3 2 one you should be able to see it there chat you should be able to see me paste this in here that would be my team oh i think you cant really see it there hang on just put it onto the screen sec talk amongst yourselves ladies and gentlemen talk amongst yourselves that would be my team there oh youd be having the man united defender in mazari yeah why is that considering you just absolutely slammed man united youre going with a man united asset whats that all about i do the look of him he had a cracking shot today oh the one through the legs yeah i do him i do think hes a very attackminded player much more attacking than waka how the will you be bringing in an arsenal oh you got havs havent you not concerned about sacka well cant have more can you chelsea yes but palmers too much money i could go do the whole jackson keep jackson and save my money there and spread it elsewhere in midfield but if i could free 15m having jackson instead of watkins but consideration but yeah im not having salah or not having salah is it going to bite us all in the in the in the ass essentially well if you put salah in that team youre going to have to restructure everything because he comes in for lets just say jotter then you wont be able to have no i wont be able to have i wont be able to have havs no okay lets just lets build a harand salah team so it be jackson out havit out and itll be it be pedro in and it would be say wher oh my god everyones gone up in value steo i know theyve gone up in value thats why im making sure that i dont lose value oh my god how much have you lost in money 01 02 how do i one sec i one 1006 and i got 01 in the bank well thats your team value but you must have what players have you must have lost 01 on fernandez on e only on e on e right okay so you got rid of fernandez before he had a price drop correct thats really good thats really good so you pedro jackson harland and then i would go jo j out salah in which then i need to free up oh wow i can i can do this i can do this quite easily wow steo im im looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this give me a moment give me a momento fabianski ill put you back in best 45 goalkeeper chat fleen veran sells of nottingham forest fabian whats the news on arola anybody in chat news on arola best 45 chat when incredibly im looking at this v bruan and fleen double up okay and i actually prefer it to just having martinez and id rather than have a conza from villa instead well it would mean having taken out oh my god in fact i can even get rid of greaves if i stuck with this team and not worry about watkins because blazy makes a point here that watkins you cant really justify his price currently i completely agree what jackson at 75 he a 75 is he arola hurt his back is that it is that all he did is jackson worth 75m again if youre happy to i dont have a problem with him is he a guaranteed starter i dont know i dont im not a chelsea aicio unfortunately but i must say that i do the vuan and fleen double up i think thats i think thats the move for me in fact im even going to do that right now im going to do that right this second confirm transfers thats done and i do agree with chat theyre saying about lewis being dropped being dropped for the arsenal game yeah it probably will happen but his value is just skyrocketing hes gonna be going up in price again sano is a good pick in he yeah he stands out at his price point 55 is on penalties you say yes and kevin kelly making a point here its not a bad one kevin k instead of 25 two 45 goalkeepers would it not be better to have ry and 14m that equals the same 95 doesnt equal it doesnt equal nine unfortunately if it was a five goalkeeper brilliant unfortunately its not its a 55 im close to maybe working out something magical here steo well if you actually hit your no i havent hit it yet if i come if i find something really magical here then i think its dont matter i think i have to lets quickly look defenders what defenders do i really want in my team that are going to get me loads of points ric lewis for the price point i can see why youve done it i really can hes cheap and hes playing hes got brenford next hes got brenford next a dread maker a point jotter next week could be the one getting the points and diaz blanking i dont think diaz is blanked at all this season i think diaz has returned in every single match so far and the answer is all right away i switch nothing three points but then hes got a four thats ridiculous a 14 and a 15 pointer was he visa a good option yeah cheap 6m guaranteed to play for brenford absolutely nailed absolutely ned gravy dave said im gonna be going with pal torres well gravy dave is doing extremely well in the youtube chat league fire talk saying jason is stealing all of steves different r ma madai played 85 minutes today and he looked good did you
